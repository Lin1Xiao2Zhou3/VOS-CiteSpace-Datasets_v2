AB Wnt3a is a glycosylated ligand that activates the beta catenin dependent signaling pathway. Wnt signaling is also important in the prostate tumor microenvironment, and Wnt proteins secreted by the tumor stroma promote resistance to therapy. Bioactive Wnt3a production requires a number of dedicated factors in the secretory cell, but their coordinated functions are not fully understood. We previously reported transmembrane protein 64 (Tmem64) as a novel regulator of the Wnt/beta catenin signaling pathway, which is correlated with beta catenin regulation. In the present study, the role of Tmem64 in prostate cancer cells was investigated by modulating Wnt3a secretion. Overexpression of Tmem64 inhibited Wnt3a secretion and Lef/Tcf sensitive transcription. By contrast, a Tmem64 mutation deleting the protein's transmembrane region restored Wnt3a secretion. Notably, Tmem64 protein and mRNA in PC3 cells were significantly overexpressed compared with that observed in LNCaP and DU145 cells. In a mouse metastasis model intracardially injected with PC3 cells, Tmem64 expression was downregulated in the metastatic spine and mandible lesions compared with in the primary injection regions. However, Wnt3a was strongly expressed in the metastatic spine and mandible lesions. Collectively, these findings suggest that Tmem64 is involved in the metastatic progression of prostate cancer cells by regulating Wnt3a secretion.

AB Yunnan Baiyao (YNBY) has been refined for hundreds of years and has become a treasure of proprietary Chinese medicine that has significant curative effects in the field of hemostasis, blood circulation, and callus. In past years, YNBY has been demonstrated to play an anti inflammatory role in bone related diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis. However, the osteoclasts are multinucleated giant cells that resorb bone and participate in the occurrence, development, and progression of these bone related diseases. Previous studies have reported that the inflammatory function is closely associated with arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, as well as some inflammatory related pathways, including the nuclear factor kB (NF kB), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Wnt5a pathways. Therefore, we speculated that the anti inflammatory effect of YNBY might be associated with the NF kB, MAPK, and Wnt5a pathways. In order to further excavate the anti inflammatory roles of YNBY, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with an optimal concentration of 1,000 pg/ml was used to induce inflammation in osteoclasts. Our results showed that YNBY with a time  and dose dependent method decreased the concentration of pro inflammatory cytokines and the expression levels of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX 1), COX 2, 5 lipoxygenase, and prostaglandin E2. Moreover, it was found that COX 2 was the target gene regulated by YNBY. Finally, using NF kB and MAPK pathway inhibitors or miRNA101b (involved in the Wnt5a pathway) in tandem with YNBY and the results exhibited that these groups caused a reduction in COX 1 and COX 2 expression, indicating that the anti inflammatory function of YNBY might directly affect the NF kB, MAPK, and Wnt5a pathways.
   Practical applications Yunnan Baiyao (YNBY) is mainly extracted from precious Chinese medicines such as Panax notoginseng, borneol, musk, and yam and has a wide range of clinical applications. It is not only used to treat various types of traumatic injuries, but also used for upper gastrointestinal bleeding and wound ulcers, neonatal umbilitis, recurrent oral ulcers, esophagitis, bacterial dysentery, and so on. Although the detailed mechanism of action is not clear at present, it is believed that this is related to its anti inflammatory, hemostatic, and immune enhancing effects. Many bone related diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis, are regarded to be intimately related to the inflammatory reaction. Thus, this study aimed to explore the underlying mechanisms of YNBY at anti inflammatory roles. And our results suggested that YNBY directly affected the inflammatory cytokines and AA metabolic products which referred to the NF kB, MAPK, and Wnt5a pathways, as well as AA metabolism, respectively. Hence, the practical applications of YNBY are the anti inflammatory effects used to treat for bone related diseases.

AB Objective: Several characteristics of bone targeted agents are considered when making treatment decisions. 'this study evaluated physicians' therapy preferences for preventing skeletal related events (SREs) in patients with bone metastases secondary to solid tumors. Methods: A Web enabled, discrete choice experiment online survey was conducted among physicians who treated patients with bone metastases and solid tumors in the United States. Respondents chose between pairs of hypothetical medications defined by combinations of six attributes at varying levels for two hypothetical patients. Preference weights for attribute levels were estimated using a randomparameters logit model. Results: In total, 200 physicians completed the survey. Their mean age was 52 years, 57% were in practice for more than 15 years, 37% were oncologists, and 65% treated 10 or fewer patients with bone metastases weekly. Out of pocket cost to patients was the most important attribute overall. Among clinical outcomes, time to first SRE and risk of renal impairment were the most important attributes. Statistically significant preferences were observed for all attribute levels for time to first SRE, risk of renal impairment, and mode of administration. Predicted choice probability analysis showed that physicians preferred a hypothetical medication with attributes similar to those of denosumab over one with attributes similar to those of zoledronic acid. Conclusions: Physicians indicated that clinical attributes are important when considering bone targeting therapy for bone metastases, but consistent with the current health care landscape, patient out of pocket cost was the most important. With health care costs being increasingly shifted to patients, physicians require accurate information about co pays and assistance programs to avoid patients receiving less costly, yet potentially inferior, treatment.

AB Loss or damage to the mandible caused by trauma, treatment of oral malignancies, and other diseases is treated using bonegrafting techniques that suffer from numerous shortcomings and contraindications. Zebrafish naturally heal large injuries to mandibular bone, offering an opportunity to understand how to boost intrinsic healing potential. Using a novel her6:mCherry Notch reporter, we show that canonical Notch signaling is induced during the initial stages of cartilage callus formation in both mesenchymal cells and chondrocytes following surgical mandibulectomy. We also show that modulation of Notch signaling during the initial post operative period results in lasting changes to regenerate bone quantity one month later. Pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling reduces the size of the cartilage callus and delays its conversion into bone. resulting in non union. Conversely, conditional transgenic activation of Notch signaling accelerates conversion of the cartilage callus into bone. improving bone healing. Given the conserved functions of this pathway in bone repair across vertebrates, we propose that targeted activation of Notch signaling during the early phases of bone healing in mammals may both augment the size of the initial callus and boost its ossification into reparative bone.

ID BETA CATENIN GENE; TUMOR
AB The purpose of the present study is to report 2 cases of odontogenic carcinoma with dentinoid, a rare low grade odontogenic carcinoma associated with facial deformity and bone loss, and to investigate the presence of pathogenic mutations in these samples. By using a next generation sequencing approach, we sequenced a panel of 50 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes commonly mutated in human cancer. Microscopic features of both cases revealed solid areas of malignant odontogenic tumor with a large amount of dentinoid material. We identified pathogenic mutations in the genes CTNNB1 and APC, both of which are part of the Wnt signaling pathway. Consistent with Wnt signaling activation, both tumors showed strong beta catenin accumulation in the cytoplasm and in the nuclei. The molecular profile of odontogenic carcinoma with dentinoid may help in its diagnosis, as well as in the identification of potential molecular targets for therapy in the future.

TI HYPERCALCEMIA SECONDARY TO GASTROINTESTINAL STROMAL TUMORS: PARATHYROID
   HORMONE RELATED PROTEIN INDEPENDENT MECHANISM?
SO ENDOCRINE PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
ID MALIGNANCY; PATIENT; CANCER; BONE
AB Objective: Hypercalcemia is a common paraneoplastic manifestation of many malignancies like breast, ovarian, and squamous cell cancers of head and neck; however, there have been only a few case reports of hypercalcemia associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). We report a case of GIST presenting with hypercalcemia without any osseous metastasis and provide a literature review regarding the mechanisms of hypercalcemia and therapeutic strategies.
   Methods: We present a report of case and a review of the relevant literature.
   Results: A 52 year old woman with history of localized breast cancer in remission and a pelvic 13 x 12 cm GIST with peritoneal, liver, and lung metastases presented with hypercalcemia of 14.3 mg/dL (8.5 10.5 mg/dL). Parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP) was undetectable, intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) was appropriately low at 1 pg/mL (10 65 pg/mL), and 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25 OH2 vit D) was elevated at 131 pg/mL (18 78 pg/mL) with normal renal function. Calcium responded transiently to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and bisphosphonates but within a year, she expired due to tumor progression.
   Conclusion: GIST is a rare cause of hypercalcemia. In addition to PTHrP expression, direct tumor production of 1,25(OH)(2) vit D or 1 alpha hydroxylase enzyme resulting in activation of 25 hydroxy vitamin D may be an alternative mechanism in GIST related hypercalcemia. Therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and bisphosphonates is recommended, though prognosis is poor. Further investigations are needed to characterize the etiology and management of hypercalcemia in these patients.

AB Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease that is characterized by heightened state of bone resorption accompanied by diminished bone formation, leading to a reduction of bone mineral density (BMD) and deterioration of bone quality, thus increasing the risk of developing fractures. Molecular insight into bone biology identified cathepsin K (CatK) as a novel therapeutic target. CatK is a lysosomal cysteine protease secreted by activated osteoclasts during bone resorption, whose primary substrate is type I collagen, the major component of organic bone matrix. Available anti resorptive drugs affect osteoclast survival and influence both resorption and formation of bone. CatK inhibitors are distinct from the existing anti resorptives as they only target the resorption process itself without impairing osteoclast differentiation and do not interfere with bone formation. An inhibitor of CatK, odanacatib, robustly increased both trabecular and cortical BMD in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients. The phase III fracture prevention trial with odanacatib ended early due to good efficacy and a favorable benefit/risk profile, thus, enhancing the opportunity for CatK as a pharmacological target for osteoporosis. So far, all the inhibitors that reached to the stage of clinical trial targeted active site of CatK to abrogate the entire proteolytic activity of the enzyme in addition to the desired blockage of excessive elastin and collagen degradation, and could thus pose safety concerns with long term use. Identification of selective exosite inhibitors that inhibit CatK's elastase and/or collagenase activity but do not affect the hydrolysis of other physiologically relevant substrates of CatK would be an improved strategy to inhibit this enzyme.

AB Achyranthes bidentata, is a herbal plant commonly used in the treatment of osteoporosis and bone nonunion in the Traditional Chinese Medicine. Saponins are the major compounds extracted from Achyranthes bidentata that have been shown to exert various pharmacological activities such as anti inflammatory, antipyretic, antirheumatic, diuretic, and anti osteoporosis. The Achyranthes bidentata saponins (ABS) were found to induce proliferation and differentiation in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) as determined by the cell proliferation and alkaline phosphatase assays. Also, following the osteogenic induction, cells treated with ABS showed increased mRNA levels of rat bone morphogenetic protein 2, runt related transcription factor 2, and osterix. Furthermore, ABS stimulated the activation of ERK as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of these proteins, which was blocked by an inhibitor of ERK (PD98059). Taken together, these results suggest that ABS stimulated osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs via activation of the ERK signaling pathway.

AB Bone metastases are common in many advanced solid tumours, being breast, prostate, thyroid, lung, and renal cancer the most prevalent. Bone metastases can produce skeletal related events (SREs), defined as pathological fracture, spinal cord compression, need of bone irradiation or need of bone surgery, and hypercalcaemia. Patients with bone metastases experience pain, functional impairment and have a negative impact on their quality of life. Several imaging techniques are available for diagnosis of this disease. Bone targeted therapies include zoledronic acid, a potent biphosfonate, and denosumab, an anti RANKL monoclonal antibody. Both reduce the risk and/or delay the development of SREs in several types of tumours. Radium 233, an alpha particle emitter, increases overall survival in patients with bone metastases from resistant castration prostate cancer. Multidisciplinary approach is essential and bone surgery and radiotherapy should be integrated in the treatment of bone metastases when necessary. This SEOM Guideline reviews bone metastases pathogenesis, clinical presentations, lab tests, imaging techniques for diagnosis and response assessment, bone targeted agents, and local therapies, as radiation and surgery, and establishes recommendations for the management of patients with metastases to bone.

AB Despite strong preclinical data, the therapeutic benefit of the RANKL inhibitor, denosumab, in breast cancer patients, beyond the bone, is unclear. Aiming to select patients who may benefit from denosumab, we hereby analyzed RANK and RANKL protein expression in more than 2,000 breast tumors (777 estrogen receptor negative, ER ) from four independent cohorts. RANK protein expression was more frequent in ER  tumors, where it associated with poor outcome and poor response to chemotherapy. In ER  breast cancer patient derived orthoxenografts (PDXs), RANKL inhibition reduced tumor cell proliferation and stemness, regulated tumor immunity and metabolism, and improved response to chemotherapy. Intriguingly, tumor RANK protein expression associated with poor prognosis in postmenopausal breast cancer patients, activation of NFKB signaling, and modulation of immune and metabolic pathways, suggesting that RANK signaling increases after menopause. Our results demonstrate that RANK protein expression is an independent biomarker of poor prognosis in postmenopausal and ER  breast cancer patients and support the therapeutic benefit of RANK pathway inhibitors, such as denosumab, in breast cancer patients with RANK(+) ER  tumors after menopause.

TI Polyaptamer Driven Crystallization of Alendronate for Synergistic
   Osteoporosis Treatment through Osteoclastic Inhibition and Osteogenic

AB Osteoclastic inhibition using antiresorptive bisphosphonates and osteogenic promotion using antisclerostin agents represent two distinct osteoporosis treatments in clinical practice, each individual treatment suffers from unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy due to its indirect intervention in osteoclasis and promotion of osteogenesis simultaneously. Although this issue is anticipated to be resolved by drug synergism, a tempting carrier free dual medication nanoassembly remains elusive. Herein, we prepare such a nanoassembly made of antiresorptive alendronate (ALN) crystal and antisclerostin polyaptamer (Apt) via a nucleic acid driven crystallization method. This nanoparticle can protect Apt from rapid nuclease degradation, avoid the high cytotoxicity of free ALN, and effectively concentrate in the cancellous bone by virtue of the bone binding ability of DNA and ALN. More importantly, the acid microenvironment of cancellous bone triggers the disassociation of nanoparticles for sustained drug release, from which ALN inhibits the osteoclast mediated bone resorption while Apt promotes osteogenic differentiation. Our work represents a pioneering demonstration of nucleic acid driven crystallization of a bisphosphonate into a tempting carrier free dual medication nanoassembly. This inaugural advancement augments the antiosteoporosis efficacy through direct inhibition of osteoclasis and promotion of osteogenesis simultaneously and establishes a paradigm for profound understanding of the underlying synergistic antiosteoporosis mechanism of antiresorptive and antisclerostin components. It is envisioned that this study provides a highly generalizable strategy applicable to the tailoring of a diverse array of DNA inorganic nanocomposites for targeted regulation of intricate pathological niches.

AB NBP (nitrogen containing bisphosphonate) drugs protect against excessive osteoclast mediated bone resorption. After binding to bone mineral, they are taken up selectively by the osteoclasts and inhibit the essential enzyme FDPS (farnesyl diphosphate synthase). NBPs inhibit also growth of amoebae of Dictyostelium discoideum in which their target is again FDPS. A fusion protein between FDPS and GFP (green fluorescent protein) was found, in D. discoideum, to localize to peroxisomes and to confer resistance to the NBP alendronate. GFP was also directed to peroxisomes by a fragment of FDPS comprising amino acids 1 22. This contains a sequence of nine amino acids that closely resembles the nonapeptide PTS2 (peroxisomal targeting signal type 2): there is only a single amino acid mismatch between the two sequences. Mutation analysis confirmed that the atypical PTS2 directs FDPS into peroxisomes. Furthermore, expression of the D. discoideum FDPS GFP fusion protein in strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae defective in peroxisomal protein import demonstrated that import of FDPS into peroxisomes was blocked in a strain lacking the PTS2 dependent import pathway. The peroxisomal location of FDPS in D. discoideum indicates that NBPs have to cross the peroxisomal membrane before they can bind to their target.

TI mTOR Inhibition Subdues Milk Disorder Caused by Maternal VLDLR Loss

AB It is unknown whether and how very low density lipoprotein receptors (VLDLRs) impact skeletal homeostasis. Here, we report that maternal and offspring VLDLRs play opposite roles in osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. VLDLR deletion in the offspring augments osteoclast differentiation by enhancing RANKL signaling, leading to osteoporosis. In contrast, VLDLR deletion in the mother alters milk metabolism, which inhibits osteoclast differentiation and causes osteopetrosis in the offspring. The maternal effects are dominant. VLDLR null lactating mammary gland exhibits higher mTORC1 signaling and cholesterol biosynthesis. Pharmacological probing reveals that rapamycin, but not statin, treatment of the VLDLR null mother can prevent both the low bone resorption and our previously described inflammatory fur loss in their offspring. Genetic rescue reveals that maternal mTORC1 attenuation in adipocytes, but not in myeloid cells, prevents offspring osteopetrosis and fur loss. Our studies uncover functions of VLDLR and mTORC1 in lactation and osteoclastogenesis, illuminating key mechanisms and therapeutic insights for bone and metabolic diseases.

TI Alendronate carbon dots targeting bone immune microenvironment for the
   treatment of osteoporosis

AB Bisphosphonates (BPs) are some of the most widely used drugs in osteoporosis (OP) treatment, but they can cause severe side effects such as bisphosphonate related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ), causing great pain in patients. It is necessary to develop a novel drug for treating OP with fewer side effects. In this study, novel carbon dots, ALEN CDs, derived from polyethylene glycol (PEG) and alendronate (ALEN) are developed. ALEN CDs have good biocompatibility, photoluminescence (PL) properties, and bone targeting ability. They can inhibit the differentiation and maturation of osteoclasts, play an immunoregulatory role by inhibiting macrophage polarization to the pro inflammatory M1 phenotype, and promote polarization to the anti inflammatory M2 phenotype. It is worth noting that compared with ALEN, high dose applications of ALEN CDs do not lead to BRONJ, which may be related to the regulatory effect on M2 macrophage polarization. Moreover, in vivo studies show that ALEN CDs significantly reduce bone loss and improve OP in ovariectomized mice (OVX). And a proteomic analysis suggestes that ALEN CDs regulate the bone immune microenvironment by affecting mitochondrial metabolism, especially oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In conclusion, ALEN CDs could directly inhibit osteoclast differentiation and regulate the bone immune microenvironment and may be a promising drug for OP treatment.

AB Fracture healing is a biologically optimized process. Despite the expectation of unimpaired healing, approximately 5% to 10% of the 7.9 million fractures sustained annually in the United States have difficulty achieving union. Not only does this cause morbidity for patients, but also enormous healthcare and socioeconomic costs. Hence, there is a compelling need to find novel therapies to enhance fracture healing. In this article, we summarize current data on therapies to enhance skeletal healing and review their suggested biologic functions, proposed clinical applications, and known efficacies.

AB Vascular medial calcification is often observed in patients with arteriosclerosis. It is also associated with systolic hypertension, wide pulse pressure, and fluctuation of blood pressure, which results in cardiovascular events. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has been shown to suppress vascular calcification in previous animal experiments. We investigated the inhibitory effects of EPA on Wnt signaling, which is one of the important signaling pathways involved in vascular calcification. Intake of food containing 5% EPA resulted in upregulation of the mRNA expression of Klotho, an intrinsic inhibitor of Wnt signaling, in the kidneys of wild type mice. Expression levels of beta catenin, an intracellular signal transducer in the Wnt signaling pathway, were increased in the aortas of Klotho mutant (kl/kl) mice compared to the levels in the aortas of wild type mice. Wnt3a or BIO, a GSK 3 inhibitor that activates beta catenin signaling, upregulated mRNA levels of AXIN2 and LEF1, Wnt signaling marker genes, and RUNX2 and BMP4, early osteogenic genes, in human aorta smooth muscle cells. EPA suppressed the upregulation of AXIN2 and BMP4. The effect of EPA was cancelled by T0070907, a PPAR gamma inhibitor. The results suggested that EPA could suppress vascular calcification via the inhibition of Wnt signaling in osteogenic vascular smooth muscle cells via PPAR gamma activation.

AB Cyclosporin A (CyA) is an immunosuppressive agent used to prevent allograft rejection, but unfortunately it causes adverse effects such as bone diseases, osteoporosis and osteomalacia. These pathologies involve an imbalance between synthesis, degradation and mineralization of extracellular matrix. CyA can modify extracellular matrix components such as glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and collagen fibers. In addition, normal cell activity is dependent on cell morphology and substrate cell attachment. We treated normal human osteoblasts with CyA and analyzed: (i) gene expression by a microarray method; (ii) extracellular GAG and collagen after H 3 glucosamine and Western blot analysis; and (iii) cytoskeletal changes, using actin and tubulin fluorescent antibodies. CyA increased intra  and extracellular GAG and extracellular GAG classes such as hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulphate, and dermatan sulphate; there was no noteworthy effect on heparan sulphate and the ratio of non sulphated to sulphated GAG. In osteoblast cultures the drug reduced cytoskeletal actin, while tubulin did not change. In vivo the osteoblasts showed morphological changes with different extracellular matrix synthesis. Microarray analysis indicated the inhibition of gene pathways related to Wnt signaling molecules, and the cytoskeletal and focal adhesion cascade. In in vitro human osteoblasts CyA modified gene expression related to cytoskeletal pattern organization and cell morphology. Since in bone pathologies osteoblasts show different morphology related to cell size, these data suggest that in vivo osteoblast different functions could be dependent on alteration of osteoblast differentiation.

AB Osteoporosis is a bone disease characterized by brittle bone and increased fracture incidence. With ageing societies worldwide, the disease presents a high burden on health systems. Furthermore, there are limited treatments for osteoporosis with just two anabolic pharmacological agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Healthy bones are believed to be maintained via an intricate relationship between dual biochemical and mechanical (bio mechanical) stimulations. It is widely considered that osteoporosis emerges as a result of disturbances to said relationship. The mechanotransduction process is key to this balance, and disruption of its dynamics in bone cells plays a role in osteoporosis development. Nonetheless, the exact details and mechanisms that drive and secure the health of bones are still elusive at the cellular and molecular scales. This study examined the dual modulation of mechanical stimulation and mechanotransduction activation dynamics in an osteoblast (OB). The aim was to find patterns of mechanotransduction dynamics demonstrating a significant change that can be mapped to alterations in the OB responses, specifically at the level of gene expression and osteogenic markers such as alkaline phosphatase. This was achieved using a three dimensional hybrid multiscale computational model simulating mechanotransduction in the OB and its interaction with the extracellular matrix, combined with a numerical analytical technique. The model and the analysis method predict that within the noise of mechanotransduction, owing to modulation of the bio mechanical stimulus and consequent gene expression, there are unique events that provide signatures for a shift in the system's dynamics. Furthermore, the study uncovered molecular interactions that can be potential drug targets.

AB Icaritin (ICT), a hydrolytic product of icariin from the genus Epimedium, has many indicated pharmacological and biological activities. Several studies have shown that ICT has potential osteoprotective effects, including stimulation of osteoblast differentiation and inhibition of osteoclast differentiation. However, the molecular mechanism for this anabolic action of ICT remains largely unknown. Here, we found that ICT could enhance MC3T3 E1 subclone 14 preosteoblastic cell differentiation associated with increased mRNA levels and protein expression of the differentiation markers alkaline phosphatase (ALP), type 1 collagen (COL1), osteocalcin (OC), osteoponin (OPN) and runt related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), and improved mineralization, confirmed by bone nodule formation and collagen synthesis. To characterize the underlying mechanisms, we examined the effect of ICT on estrogen receptor (ER) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. ICT treatment induced p38 kinase and extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation, but it demonstrated at the same time point no effect on activation of c Jun N terminal kinase (JNK). ER antagonist ICI182780, p38 antagonist SB203580 and ERK1/2 antagonist PD98059 markedly inhibited the ICT induced the mRNA expression of ALP, COL1, OC and OPN. ICI182780 attenuated the ICT induced phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2. These observations indicate a potential mechanism of osteogenic effects of ICT involving the ERK1/2 and p38 pathway activation through the ER. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Bone formation and resorption regulate bone homeostasis. Excessive osteoclastogenesis enhances bone resorption and causes osteoporosis. Although medicines targeting osteoclast have been developed, these drugs have several side effects. Natural compounds have advantages in safety and efficiency, making them potential candidates for osteoporosis treatment. Purpose: This study aims to elucidate the role of damascenone (Dama) in osteoclastogenesis and osteoporosis. Study design and methods: To demonstrate the effect of Dama on osteoclast differentiation and function, we performed multiple in vitro experiments including TRAP staining, F actin staining, bone slice resorption assay, real time PCR, and western bolt. Further, ROS detection, network pharmacology, microscale thermophoresis assay, and ChIP assay were conducted to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. Finally, the in vivo effects of Dama were verified using an ovariectomy induced osteoporosis mice model. Results: Dama inhibited RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation and bone resorptive function in vitro. The expression of osteoclast related genes and activation of MAPKs and NF kappa B signaling in osteoclast were also attenuated by Dama. Meanwhile, Dama reduced intracellular ROS level via up regulating Nrf2 expression. Network pharmacology demonstrated that HDAC2 is the potential direct target of Dama. Dama inhibited HDAC2 function and increased H3K27ac level of Nrf2, which induced Nrf2 expression and activated ROS scavenging enzymes. Inhibiting NRF2 or activating HDAC2 attenuated the effect of Dama on osteoclastogenesis. Finally, Dama injection suppressed in vivo osteoclastogenesis and ameliorated bone loss induced by OVX. Conclusion: Dama attenuates osteoclastogenesis by epigenetically modulating Nrf2 expression and ROS scavenge. This study provides evidence for Dama being a potential treatment for osteoporosis.

AB Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease characterized by low bone mass and micro architectural deterioration of bone, for which the underlying mechanism is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone remodeling. The protein protein interactions between receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), RANK (its receptor), and osteoprotegerin (OPG), are known to mediate the development and activation of osteoclasts in bone remodeling, and are regarded as a pivotal therapeutic target for the treatment of osteoporosis. Herein, we disclose the successful development of a novel glycopeptide (OM 2), the structure of which is based on the key interacting sites of the reported RANKL and OPG crystal structure. OM 2 exhibited potent binding affinity with RANKL and resistance to degradation by protease enzymes. It also blocked RANKL/RANK interactions, and inhibited osteoclastogenesis in vitro. In vivo studies confirmed that OM 2 could effectively reduce bone loss and inhibit osteoclast activation in ovariectomized (OVX) mice at a dosage of 20.0 mg/kg/day. Accordingly, OM 2 is suggested as a therapeutic candidate for postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) and osteoclastogenesis related diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). More importantly, its identification validates our structure based strategy for the development of drugs that target the RANKL/RANK/OPG system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Infection by bacterial products in the implant and endotoxin introduced by wear particles activate immune cells, enhance pro inflammatory cytokines production, and ultimately promote osteoclast recruitment and activity. These factors are known to play an important role in osteolysis as well as potential targets for the treatment of osteolysis. Sesamin has been shown to have a variety of biological functions, such as inhibiting inflammation, anti tumour and involvement in the regulation of fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism. However, the therapeutic effect of sesamin on osteolysis and its mechanism remain unclear. Present studies shown that in the condition of in vitro, sesamin could inhibit osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, as well as suppressing the expression of osteoclast specific genes. Further studies on the mechanism suggest that the effect of sesamin on human osteoclasts was mediated by blocking the ERK and NF kappa B signalling pathways. Besides, sesamin was found to be effective in treating LPS induced osteolysis by decreasing the production of pro inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting osteoclastogenesis in vivo. Sesamin was non toxic to heart, liver, kidney, lung and spleen. Therefore, sesamin is a promising phytochemical agent for the therapy of osteolysis related diseases caused by inflammation and excessive osteoclast activation.

AB Loganin, a major iridoid glycoside derived from Cornus officinalis, exerts strong anti inflammatory property. The present study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanism of loganin to reduce estrogen deficiency induced bone loss through a combination of network pharmacology, molecular docking and in vivo validation. First, the drug targets and structural interactions of loganin with osteoclasts on postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) were predicted through network pharmacology and molecular docking. An ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model was established to experimentally validate loganin's anti PMOP efficacy, supported by its protective effect on bone destruction and excessive inflammatory cytokines. The top 10 core targets of loganin generated by a protein protein interaction network were the following: GAPDH, VEGFA, EGFR, ESR1, HRAS, SRC, FGF2, HSP90AA1, PTGS2 and IL 2. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses indicated that loganin suppressed PMOP via mediating inflammation, bone formation, IL 17 signaling pathway and NF kappa B signaling pathway. Molecular docking results indicated strong binding between loganin and core targets, in which the binding energy was approximately  5.2 and  7.4 kcal/mol. In vivo mouse model revealed that loganin inhibited the expression of pro osteoclastic markers, such as tartrate resistant acid phosphatase, C terminal telopeptide, TNF alpha and IL 6, enhanced the secretion of bone formation markers, such as procollagen type I intact n terminal pro peptide and IL 10, and improved bone micro structure (bone volume/tissue volume and trabecular number), representative of the anti resorptive effect mediated by loganin. In summary, the present study combined network pharmacology and molecular docking to predict the underlying mechanism of loganin against PMOP, validated by the in vivo mouse model showing that loganin attenuated OVX induced bone loss by inhibiting inflammation.

AB Osteoporosis is a serious public health problem that results in fragility fractures, especially in postmenopausal women. Because the current therapeutic strategy for osteoporosis has various side effects, a safer and more effective treatment is worth exploring. It is important to examine natural plant extracts during new drug design due to low toxicity. Mogrol is an aglycon of mogroside, which is the active component of Siraitia grosvenorii (Swingle) and exhibits anti inflammatory, anticancer and neuroprotective effects. Here, we demonstrated that mogrol dose dependently inhibited osteoclast formation and function. To confirm the mechanism, RNA sequencing (RNA seq), real time PCR (RT PCR), immunofluorescence and Western blotting were performed. The RNA seq data revealed that mogrol had an effect on genes involved in osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, RT PCR indicated that mogrol suppressed osteoclastogenesis related gene expression, including CTSK, ACP5, MMP9 and DC STAMP, in RANKL induced bone marrow macrophages Western blotting demonstrated that mogrol suppressed osteoclast formation by blocking TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) dependent activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase nuclear factor B (NF kappa B) signaling pathway, which decreased two vital downstream transcription factors, the nuclear factor of activated T cells calcineurin dependent 1 (NFATc1) and c Fos proteins expression. Furthermore, mogrol dramatically reduced bone mass loss in postmenopausal mice. In conclusion, these data showed that mogrol may be a promising procedure for osteoporosis prevention or therapy.

AB Osteoporosis (OP) is a systemic metabolic orthopedic disorder prevalent in elderly people, that is characterized by a decrease in bone mass. Although many therapeutics have been adopted for OP treatment, many of them are still not well satisfied clinical requirements and therefore development of novel therapeutics is of great significance. In this work, a novel bone targeting drug self frame delivery system (DSFDS) with high drug loading efficiency and pH responsive drug release was fabricated by condensation of curcumin (Cur), amino group terminated polyethylene glycol (NH2 PEG), and alendronate (ALN) using hexachlorocyclotriphosphonitrile (HCCP) as the linker. The final product named as HCCP Cur PEG ALN (HCPA NPs) displayed excellent water dispersity with small size (181.9 & PLUSMN; 25.9 nm). Furthermore, the drug loading capacity of Cur can reach 25.8%, and Cur can be released from HCPA NPs under acidic environment. Owing to the introduction of ALN, HCPA NPs exhibited strong binding to HAp in vitro and excellent bone targeting effect in vivo. Results from cellular and biochemical analyses revealed that HCPA NPs could effectively inhibit the formation and differentiation function of osteoclasts. More importantly, we also demonstrated that HCPA NPs could effectively reduce bone loss in OVX mice with low toxicity to major organs. The above results clearly demonstrated that HCPA NPs are promising for OP treatment. Given the simplicity and well designability of fabrication strategy, explicit therapy efficacy and low toxicity of HCPA NPs, we believe that this work should be of great interest for fabrication of various DSFDS to deal with many diseases.

AB In the present study, we have attempted to evaluate the pharmacological actions of three major phenolic antidiarrheic ingredients, including 2 methoxyphenol (2MP), 2 methoxy 4 methylphenol (2M4MP) and 2 methoxy 4 ethyphenol (2M4EP), on the functionality and integrity of bone by in vitro and in vivo experimental techniques. Intermittent oral administration of 2M4MP and 2M4EP, but not 2MP, significantly prevented reductions of bone mineral density in total femur, distal femur and tibia, in addition to alterations of several osteoclastic parameters on histomorphometric analysis, when determined 28 days after ovariectomy in mice. All three phenolic ingredients examined significantly inhibited the developmental increase in the number of multinucleated cells positive to tartrate resistant acid phosphatase staining in cultured mouse osteoclasts differentiated from bone marrow precursors in the presence of both macrophage colony stimulating factor and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand, which occurred in a concentration dependent manner at a concentration range of 1 mu M 1 mM without inducing cell death. Moreover, both 2M4MP and 2M4EP at 1 mM not only prevented the cell death induced by 0.5 mM H2O2 in cultured rat calvarial osteoblasts, but also suppressed the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species in osteoblasts exposed to H2O2, with a radical scavenging action as revealed by electron spin resonance analysis. These results suggest that particular phenolic antidiarrheic ingredients may prevent ovariectomy induced bone loss through a mechanism related to the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis in association with an anti oxidative property in osteoblasts.

AB Objectives
   To evaluate the in vitro effect of the bisphosponate zoledronate on metabolic activity, proliferation and viability of human osieoblasts.
   Methods
   Primary human osteoblasts cultures were obtained from cancellous bone of healthy subjects undergoing bone marrow biopsy. Cell cultures were treated with crescent concentrations of zoledronate (10( 10)to 10( 3)), with and without 1,25(OH)(2) vitamin D 3. In these experimental conditions we evaluated cells viability and proliferation using the MMT colorimetric test, cell apoptosis by measurement of Caspase 3 activity and metabolic cell activity through alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin production.
   Results
   Osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase synthesis was significantly enhanced by 10( 10)M to 10( 5)M zoledronate concentrations, whereas was dramatically decreased by higher drug concentrations. Vitamin D, enhanced the positive metabolic effect of zoledronate. The effect of zoledronate on cell proliferation was variable and dose dependent. While no effect was observed with lower drug concentrations (10( 10)M to 10( 8)M), zoledronate 10( 7)M increased cell proliferation. Conversely, concentrations higher than 10( 7)M significantly reduced cell proliferation, in a dose dependent manner. Osteoblast apoptosis was enhanced after treatment with the highest zoledronate concentrations. The maximum positive effect on osteoblasts metabolic activity and proliferation was observed with the zoledronate concentrations corresponding to those theoretically reached in bone microenvironment when zoledronate is used in clinical practice for post menopausal osteoporosis treatment.
   Conclusion
   The results of this study confirm that bisphosphonates exert different cellular biochemical effects depending on dosage and support the hypothesis that their positive effect on bone mineral density could be partially due to an anabolic action on bone forming cells.

AB Zoledronic acid (ZOL), belonging to third generation bisphosphonate family, is a potent inhibitor of osteoclast mediated bone resorption, widely used to effectively prevent osteolysis in breast cancer patients who develop bone metastases. Low doses of ZOL have been shown to exhibit a direct anticancer role, by inhibiting cell adhesion, invasion, cytoskeleton remodelling and proliferation in MCF 7 breast cancer cells. In order to identify the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying the anticancer activity exerted by ZOL, we analyzed for the first time the microRNA expression profile in breast cancer cells. A large scale microarray analysis of 377 miRNAs was performed on MCF7 cells treated with 10 mu M ZOL for 24 h compared to untreated cells. Furthermore, the expression of specific ZOL induced miRNAs was analyzed in MCF 7 and SkBr3 cells through Real time PCR. Low dose treatment with ZOL significantly altered expression of 54 miRNAs. Nine upregulated and twelve downregulated miRNAs have been identified after 24 h of treatment. Also, ZOL induced expression of 11 specific miRNAs and silenced expression of 22 miRNAs. MiRNA data analysis revealed the involvement of differentially expressed miRNAs in PI3K/Akt, MAPK, Wnt, TGF beta, Jak STAT and mTOR signaling pathways, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Our results have been shown to be perfectly coherent with the recent findings reported in literature concerning changes in expression of some miRNAs involved in bone metastasis formation, progression, therapy resistance in breast cancer. In conclusion, this data supports the hypothesis that ZOL induced modification of the miRNA expression profile contributes to the anticancer efficacy of this agent.

AB Commonly used implants for therapeutic approaches of non systemically impaired bone do not sufficiently support the healing process of osteoporotic bone. Since strontium (II) has been proven as an effective anti osteoporotic drug new types of strontium enriched calcium phosphate bone cements were developed. As osteoporosis is characterized by an imbalance of osteoblast and osteoclast activity the influence of this newly generated strontium enriched biomaterials on the cellular behavior of osteoblast like cells was investigated by time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF SIMS). ToF SIMS is used to analyze whether strontium is incorporated in the mineralized extracellular matrix (mECM) and whether there is strontium uptake by osteogenically differentiated human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Therefore hMSCs were cultured in osteogenic differentiation medium for 21 days on two different strontium enriched bone cements (S100 and A10) and for reference also on the pure calcium phosphate cement (CPC) and on a silicon wafer. The distribution of strontium in the osteoblast like cells and within their mineralized extracellular matrix was analyzed. A higher intensity of the strontium signal could be detected in the region of the mECM, synthesized by cells cultivated on the Sr substituted bone cement (S100) in comparison to the reference groups. The osteoblast like cells used the released strontium from the biomaterial to synthesize their mECM. Apart from that a uniform strontium distribution was measured within all investigated cells. However, different amounts of strontium were found in cells cultured on different biomaterials and substrates. Compared to the negative controls the strontium content in the cells on the strontium enriched biomaterials was much higher. A higher concentration of strontium inside the cells means that more strontium can take part in signaling pathways. As strontium is known for its beneficial effects on osteoblasts by promoting osteoblastic cell replication and differentiation, and reducing apoptosis, the newly developed strontium enriched calcium phosphate cements are promising implant materials for osteoporotic bone.

AB Many commonly consumed foods, herbs and spices contain a complex array of naturally occurring bioactive molecules called phytochemicals, which may confer health benefits. In this study, the impact of LiuWei Zhuanggu Granules (LWZGG) on mineral metabolism in osteopenia development was evaluated. Results showed that serum estrogen, bone gla protein (BGP), and calcitonin (CT) levels, bone Ca, Zn and Cu levels, femur, lumbar vertebrae and trabecular bone density, tibia maximum stress and maximum bending strength were increased, and serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum and urine Ca, Zn and Cu levels were decreased in rat bone. It can be concluded that LWZGG is useful to improve bone quality in ovariectomized (OVX) rats.

AB Aims: Cell therapy utilizing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from healthy donors (HE MSCs) is a promising strategy for treating osteoporotic bone defects. This study investigated the effects of interaction between HEMSCs and MSCs from osteoporotic donors (ORX MSCs) on osteoblast differentiation of MSCs and of HE MSCs on bone formation in calvarial defects of osteoporotic rats. Materials and methods: Osteoporosis was induced by orchiectomy (ORX) and its effects on the bone were evaluated by femur microtomography (mu CT) and osteoblast differentiation of bone marrow MSCs. HE  and ORX MSCs were cocultured, and osteoblast differentiation was evaluated using genotypic and phenotypic parameters. HEMSCs were injected into the calvarial defects of osteoporotic rats, and bone formation was evaluated by mu CT, histology, and gene expression of osteoblast markers. Key findings: ORX induced osteoporosis was revealed by reduced bone morphometric parameters and osteoblast differentiation in ORX MSCs. HE MSCs partially recovered the osteogenic potential of ORX MSCs, whereas HEMSCs were mildly affected by ORX MSCs. Additionally, the bone morphogenetic protein and wingless related integration site signaling pathway components were similarly modulated in cocultures involving ORX MSCs. HE MSCs induced meaningful bone formation, highlighting the effectiveness of cell therapy even in osteoporotic bones. Significance: These results provide new perspectives on the development of cell based therapies to regenerate bone defects in patients with disorders that affect bone tissue.

AB PTH is an osteoanabolic for treating osteoporosis but its potency wanes. Disabling the transcription factor nuclear matrix protein 4 (Nmp4) in healthy, ovary intact mice enhances bone response to PTH and bone morphogenetic protein 2 and protects from unloading induced osteopenia. These Nmp4( / ) mice exhibit expanded bone marrow populations of osteoprogenitors and supporting CD8(+) T cells. To determine whether the Nmp4( / ) phenotype persists in an osteoporosis model we compared PTH response in ovariectomized (ovx) wild type (VVT) and Nmp4( / ) mice. To identify potential Nmp4 target genes, we performed bioinformatic/pathway profiling on Nmp4 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP seq) data. Mice (12 w) were ovx or sham operated 4 weeks before the initiation of PTH therapy. Skeletal phenotype analysis included microcomputed tomography, histomorphometry, serum profiles, fluorescence activated cell sorting and the growth/mineralization of cultured WT and Nmp4( / ) bone marrow mesenchymal stem progenitor cells (MSPCs). ChIP seq data were derived using MC3T3 E1 preosteoblasts, murine embryonic stem cells, and 2 blood cell lines. OvxNmp4( / ) mice exhibited an improved response to PTH coupled with elevated numbers of osteoprogenitors and CD8(+) T cells, but were not protected from ovx induced bone loss. Cultured Nmp4( / ) MSPCs displayed enhanced proliferation and accelerated mineralization. ChIP seq/gene ontology analyses identified target genes likely under Nmp4 control as enriched for negative regulators of biosynthetic processes. Interrogation of mRNA transcripts in nondifferentiating and osteogenic differentiating WT and Nmp4( / ) MSPCs was performed on 90 Nmp4 target genes and differentiation markers. These data suggest that Nmp4 suppresses bone anabolism, in part, by regulating IGF binding protein expression. Changes in Nmp4 status may lead to improvements in osteoprogenitor response to therapeutic cues.

AB Osteoclasts are bone resorbing cells which play an exclusive role in bone remodeling, but the molecular mechanisms of osteolysis, how osteoclasts are activated and how the lytic granules are finally released towards the bone matrix are poorly understood. Here we show that an energy molecule ATP induces osteolysis via P2X(7) nucleotide receptor and that deacetylation of alpha tubulin is essential for the whole process of osteolysis under the control of a tyrosine kinase Syk. By developing a traceable and reproducible in vitro analyzing system for osteoclast function, we found that ATP signaling gives rise to two events simultaneously (i) cytoskeletal reorganization for the formation of sealing zones, ring like adhesion structures which delimit the contact surface, and (ii) the delivery and secretion of lytic granules towards the delimited site on the matrix. We further found that deacetylation of alpha tubulin is a critical reaction for osteoclast function. Pharmacological inhibition of alpha tubulin deacetylation resulted in (i) failure of the sealing zone like structure formation and (ii) ceased secretion of lytic granules. Additionally, kinetics of deacetylation was found to be regulated by Syk. These data suggest a novel P2X(7) microtubular regulation pathway related to Syk for a therapeutic target in osteolytic diseases.

AB Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) exert an important role in skeletal development, adult bone homeostasis, and fracture healing and have demonstrated clinical utility for bone regeneration. However, BMPs fall short as regenerative agents because high doses need to be used to obtain therapeutic effects. Determining the molecular mechanisms controlling BMP induced bone formation may lead to the development of more effective BMP based therapies. To identify kinases mediating BMP induced osteoblast differentiation, we performed an siRNA screen to find kinases modulating BMP 6 induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Surprisingly, although transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) generally is considered to antagonize BMP induced osteoblast differentiation, C2C12 cells transfected with siRNAs targeting TGF beta receptors displayed reduced BMP 6 induced ALP activity. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibitors blocking the TGF beta type I receptor impaired BMP induced ALP activity in KS483 and C2C12 cells and mineralization of KS483 cells. Consistently, costimulation with BMPs and TGF beta further increased expression of osteoblast specific genes, ALP activity, and mineralization of KS483 cells and primary mesenchymal stem cells compared with BMPs alone. The stimulatory and inhibitory effects of TGF beta were found to depend on timing and duration of the costimulation. TGF beta inhibited BMP induced activation of a BMP Smad dependent luciferase reporter, suggesting that the stimulatory effect of TGF beta is not due to increased BMP Smad activity. TGF beta also inhibited the BMP induced expression of the BMP antagonist noggin and prolonged BMP activity. In conclusion, TGF beta, besides acting as an inhibitor, also can, by dampening the noggin mediated negative feedback loop, enhance BMP induced osteoblast differentiation, which might be beneficial in fracture healing.

TI Denosumab Treatment for Juvenile Paget's Disease: Results From Two Adult
   Patients With Osteoprotegerin Deficiency ("Balkan" Mutation in the
   TNFRSF11B Gene)

   PAMIDRONATE; PHENOTYPE
AB Context: Most patients with juvenile Paget's disease (JPD) have homozygous loss of function mutations in the TNFRSF11B gene resulting in osteoprotegerin deficiency. Because recombinant osteoprotegerin is not available for clinical use, an alternative therapeutic approach could be denosumab, which acts on the same pathway.
   Main Objective: The aim was to study the effect of denosumab on bone turnover markers in two adult patients with JPD ("Balkan" mutation) previously treated with calcitonin and bisphosphonates.
   Setting: The study was conducted at two tertiary hospitals in Greece.
   Patients: Patient 1 (a 36 year old woman) developed a severe and long term hypocalcemia after a single dose (3.5 mg) of zoledronic acid. Her bone disease remained active despite treatment. Patient 2 (a 67 year old man) had satisfactorily controlled bone disease with only intermittent risedronate treatment during the last 10 years, but suffered from progressive loss of hearing and vision. Low doses (20 40 mg) of denosumab every 3 6 months were administered in both patients.
   Results: Bone markers (including total and bone specific alkaline phosphatase, procollagen I N terminal peptide, and osteocalcin) were reduced to normal levels in both patients, with nadir observed 2 4 months after each denosumab injection. Retinal and hearing involvement remained unchanged, but patient 2 developed a rapid progression of cataract in the right eye.
   Conclusions: Low dose denosumab every 3 6 months for about 2 years in two patients with JPD successfully controlled their bone disease. The long term effect of denosumab on the nonskeletal complications remains to be elucidated.

AB The cardiac subtype of the L type voltage sensitive Ca2+ channel (VSCC) Cav1.2 (alpha(1C)) is the primary voltage sensitive channel responsible for Ca2+ influx into actively proliferating osteoblasts. This channel also serves as the major transducer of Ca2+ signals in growth phase osteoblasts in response to hormone treatment. In this study, we have demonstrated that 24 h treatment of MC3T3 E1 preosteoblasts with 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [1,25(OH)(2)D 3], a coupling factor for bone resorption, coordinately downregulates Cav1.2 (alpha(1C)) and uniquely upregulates T type channel Cav3.2 (alpha(1H)). No other voltage sensitive channel alpha subunit of the 10 that were surveyed was upregulated by 1,25(OH)(2)D 3. The shift from predominantly L type to T type channel expression has been demonstrated to occur at both mRNA and protein levels detected using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry with antibodies specific for each channel type. Functional and pharmacological studies using specific inhibitors have revealed that treatment with 1,25(OH)(2)D 3 also alters the Ca2+ permeability properties of the osteoblast membrane from a state of primarily L current sensitivity to T current sensitivity. We conclude that the L type channel is likely to support proliferation of osteoblast cells, whereas T type channels are more likely to be involved in supporting differentiated functions after 1,25(OH)(2)D 3 mediated reversal of remodeling has occurred. This latter observation is consistent with the unique expression of the T type VSCC Cav3.2 (alpha(1H)) in terminally differentiated osteocytes as we recently reported.

AB Gushukang (GSK) is a traditional herbal compound used in Chinese medicine for the treatment of osteoporosis. Numerous studies have been conducted to elucidate the effects of GSK, but the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. In the present study, we cultured osteoblasts and osteoclasts with low and high doses of GSK, and also administered 3 month old mice with 4 and 8 g/kg/day of GSK solution. Gushukang was found to promote osteoblast differentiation and inhibit osteoclast differentiation in vitro. In vivo, mice in the GSK treatment groups showed an increase in bone mass, as measured by micro computed tomography (Micro CT). Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and osteocalcin (OCN) staining experiments revealed decreased bone resorption and increased bone formation in the GSK treatment groups. In addition, we found a novel effect of GSK it could induce type H vessel formation in mice. The underlying mechanisms of these actions were further explored at the molecular level to investigate whether these effects were due to an overexpression of the hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF 1 alpha). Our findings indicate the utility of GSK as a therapeutic for the prevention of osteoporosis.

AB Androgen deprivation is the mainstay of advanced prostate cancer treatment. Despite initial responses, almost all patients progress to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The understanding of the biology of CRPC and the evidence that CRPC still remains driven by androgen receptor signaling led to the discovery of new therapeutic targets. In the last few years, large Phase III trials showed improvements in survival and outcomes and led to the approval of a CYP17 inhibitor (abiraterone), an androgen receptor antagonist (enzalutamide), the taxane cabazitaxel, an  emitter (radium 223), the bone resorption targeting drug denosumab and an immunotherapy (sipuleucel T). This article describes the molecular mechanisms underlying castration resistance, discusses recent and ongoing trials and offers some insights into identifying the best sequence of new drugs.

AB Introduction: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare cancer that commonly spreads to the liver, lungs and lymph nodes. Bone metastases are infrequent.
   Objective: The aim of this report was to describe the clinical characteristics, survival perspective, prognostic factors and frequency of adverse skeletal related events (SREs) in patients with ACC who developed bone metastasis.
   Methods: This is a retrospective, observational, multicenter, multinational study of patients diagnosed with bone metastases from ACC who were treated and followed up in three European countries (France, Italy and The Netherlands) and one center in the United States.
   Results: Data of 156 patients were captured. The median overall survival was 11 months. SREs occurred in 47% of patients: 17% bone fractures, 17% spinal cord compression, 1% hypercalcemia, 12% developed more than one SRE. In multivariate analysis, cortisol hypersecretion was the only prognostic factor significantly associated with a higher mortality risk (hazard ratio (HR) 2.24, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19 4.23, P = 0.013) and with the development of a SREs (of border line significance). The administration of antiresorptive therapies (bisphosphonates and denosumab) was associated with a lower risk of death, even if not significant, and their survival benefit appeared confined in patients attaining serum mitotane levels within the therapeutic range.
   Conclusion: Bone metastases in ACC patients are associated with poor prognosis and high risk of SREs. Cortisol hypersecretion was the only prognostic factor suggesting a potential benefit from antisecretory medications. The therapeutic role of bisphosphonates and denosumab to improve patient outcome deserves to be tested in a prospective clinical trial.

AB Vascular calcification is a cardiovascular disorder with no therapeutic options. We recently reported that o octanoyltransferase (CROT) suppression can inhibit vascular calcification in vivo and in vitro through amelioration of mitochondrial function and fatty acid metabolism. Inhibiting calcification with a small molecule compound targeting CROT associated mechanisms will be a promising non invasive treatment of vascular calcification. Here we used a computational approach to search for existing drugs that can inhibit vascular calcification through the CROT pathway. For screening of the compounds that reduce CROT expression, we utilized the Connectivity Map encompassing the L1000 computational platform that contains transcription profiles of various cell lines and perturbagens including small molecules. Small molecules (n = 13) were identified and tested in human primary smooth muscle cells cultured in osteogenic media to induce calcification. Niclosamide, an FDA improved anthelmintic drug, markedly inhibited calcification along with reduced alkaline phosphatase activity and CROT mRNA expression. To validate this compound in vivo, LDL receptor (Ldlr) deficient mice fed a high fat diet were given oral doses of niclosamide (0 or 750 ppm admixed with diet) for 10 weeks. Niclosamide treatment decreased aortic and carotid artery calcification as determined by optical near infrared molecular imaging (OsteoSense680) and histological analysis. In addition, niclosamide improved features of fatty liver, including decreased cholesterol levels along with decreased Crot expression, while plasma total cholesterol levels did not change. Proteomic analysis of aortic samples demonstrated that niclosamide affected wingless/integrated (Wnt) signaling pathway and decreased runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) expression, an essential factor for calcification. Our target discovery strategy using a genetic perturbation database with existing drugs identified niclosamide, that in turn inhibited calcification in vivo and in vitro, indicating its potential for the treatment of vascular calcification.

AB Bone is constantly being renewed: in the adult skeleton, bone resorption and formation are in a tightly coupled balance, allowing for a constant bone density to be maintained. Yet this micro environment provides the necessary conditions for the growth and proliferation of tumor cells, and thus bone is a common site for the development of metastases, mainly from primary breast and prostate cancer. Mathematical and computational models with differential equations can replicate this bone remodeling process. These models have been extended to include the effects of disruptive tumor pathologies in the bone dynamics, as metastases contribute to the decoupling between bone resorption and formation and to the self perpetuating tumor growth cycle. Such models may also contemplate the counteraction effects of currently used therapies, and, in the case of treatments with drugs, their pharmocokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We present a thorough overview of biochemical models for bone remodeling, in the presence of a tumour together with anti cancer and anti resorptive therapy, formulated as systems of first order differential equations, or simplified using variable order derivatives. The latter models, of which some are new to this paper, result in equations with fewer parameters, and allow accounting for anomalous diffusion processes. In this way, more compact and parsimonious models, that promptly highlight tumorous bone interactions, are achieved, providing an effective framework to counteract the loss of bone integrity on the affected areas.

AB Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of bone and accounts for half of all primary skeletal malignancies in children and teenagers. The prognosis for patients who fail or progress on first line chemotherapy protocols is poor, therefore, additional adjuvant therapeutic strategies are needed. A recent feasibility study has demonstrated that the nitrogen containing bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (ZOL) can be combined safely with conventional chemotherapy. However, the pharmacodynamics of bisphosphonate therapy is not well characterized. Osteosarcoma is a highly angiogenic tumor. Recent reports of the anti angiogenic effects of bisphosphonates prompted us to determine whether nitrogen containing bisphosphonate (ZOL and alendronate) treatment attenuates osteosarcoma growth by inhibition of osteoclast activity, tumor mediated angiogenesis, or direct inhibitory effects on osteosarcoma. Here, we demonstrate that bisphosphonates directly inhibit VEGFR2 expression in endothelial cells, as well as endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Additionally, bisphosphonates also decrease VEGF A expression in osteosarcoma (K7M3) cells, resulting in reduced stimulation of endothelial cell migration in co culture assays. ZOL also decreases VEGFR1 expression in aggressive osteosarcoma cell lines (K7M3, 143B) and induces apoptosis of these cells, but has negligible effects on less aggressive osteosarcoma cell lines (K12 and TE85). In vivo ZOL treatment results in significant reduction in osteosarcoma initiated angiogenesis and tumor growth in a murine model of osteosarcoma. In conclusion, bisphosphonates have diverse growth inhibitory effects on osteosarcoma through: (1) activation of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation, (2) inhibition of VEGF A and VEGFR1 expression by tumor cells, (3) inhibition of tumor induced angiogenesis, and (4) direct inhibitory actions on endothelial cells.

AB Background: Breast cancer bone metastasis is closely associated with the bone microenvironment. Zuogui Pill (ZGP), a clinically approved formulation in China, effectively regulates the bone microenvironment for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.
   Purpose: Few reports have utilized the ZGP for bone metastasis models. This study investigated the intervention and bone protective properties of ZGP against breast cancer bone metastasis, explored the potential mechanism, and screened for its active compositions by molecules fishing.
   Methods: To investigate the intervention efficacy of ZGP and its protein level mechanism of action, the mouse bone metastasis model and in vitro cell co culture model were constructed. Affinity ultrafiltration, molecular docking, cellular thermal shift assay and physical scale detection were used to investigate the affinity components of the RANKL protein in ZGP.
   Results: The administration of ZGP combined with zoledronic acid inhibited the development of tumors and secondary lung metastasis in mice. This translated to a prolonged survival period and enhanced quality of life. ZGP could disrupt the malignant cycle by modulating the Piezo1 Notch 1 GPX4 signaling pathway in the "bonecancer" communication in the cell co culture model. Furthermore, 25 chemical components of ZGP were identified, with 10 active compounds exhibiting significant affinity for the RANKL protein.
   Conclusion: The findings of this work highlighted ZGP's potential for intervening in the progression of breast cancer bone metastasis. Thus, this investigation served as an experimental foundation for expanding the application scope of ZGP and for advancing drug development efforts in bone metastasis treatment.

AB Multiple myeloma (MM) associated osteolytic bone disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in MM patients and the development of new therapeutic strategies is of great interest. The proto oncogene SRC is an attractive target for such a strategy. In the current study, we investigated the effect of treatment with the SRC inhibitor saracatinib (AZD0530) on osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation and function, and on the development of MM and its associated bone disease in the 5TGM.1 and 5T2MM murine MM models. In vitro data showed an inhibitory effect of saracatinib on osteoclast differentiation, polarization and resorptive function. In osteoblasts, collagen deposition and matrix mineralization were affected by saracatinib. MM cell proliferation and tumor burden remained unaltered following saracatinib treatment and we could not detect any synergistic effects with drugs that are part of standard care in MM. We observed a marked reduction of bone loss after treatment of MM bearing mice with saracatinib as reflected by a restoration of trabecular bone parameters to levels observed in naive control mice. Histomorphometric analyses support that this occurs through an inhibition of bone resorption. In conclusion, these data further establish SRC inhibition as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of MM  associated osteolytic bone disease.

AB The presence of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in bone can influence resident cells behaviour as well as the extra cellular matrix composition and the tissue architecture. Aging, in addition to excessive overloads, unbalanced diet, smoking, predisposing genetic factors, lead to an increase of ROS and, if it is accompanied with an inappropriate production of scavengers, promotes the generation of oxidative stress that encourages bone catabolism. Furthermore, bone injuries can be triggered by numerous events such as road and sports accidents or tumour resection. Although bone tissue possesses a well known repair and regeneration capacity, these mechanisms are inefficient in repairing large size defects and bone grafts are often necessary. ROS play a fundamental role in response after the implant introduction and can influence its success. This review provides insights on the mechanisms of oxidative stress generated by an implant in vivo and suitable ways for its modulation. The local delivery of active molecules, such as polyphenols, enhanced bone biomaterial integration evidencing that the management of the oxidative stress is a target for the effectiveness of an implant. Polyphenols have been widely used in medicine for cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, bone disorders and cancer, thanks to their antioxidant and anti inflammatory properties. In addition, the perspective of new smart biomaterials and molecular medicine for the oxidative stress modulation in a programmable way, by the use of ROS responsive materials or by the targeting of selective molecular pathways involved in ROS generation, will be analysed and discussed critically.

AB Objective To determine bone mass using quantitative phalangeal bone ultrasound in institutionalized schizophrenic patients under chronic treatment with antipsychotic drugs.
   Methods A total of 73 patients with schizophrenia (25 women, mean age 59.84 +/  17.01 years; 48 men, mean ape 61.89 +/  12.95 years) and 73 healthy subjects (25 women, mean age 60.37 +/  17.16 years; 48 men. mean age 61.24 +/  13.09 years) participated in the study. Bone status was assessed using an ultrasound device that measures the amplitude dependent speed of sound (Ad SoS) in metres per second. Measurements were made on the phalanges (II V) of the non dominant hand, and the mean value was computed.
   Results The schizophrenic women had higher levels of prolactin (PRL). parathyroid hormone (PTH). alkaline phosphatase (AlPh), and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) (all p < 0.0001), and lower 25 hydroxyvitamin D(25(OH)D3) levels (p < 0.000 1) and Ad SoS values (p < 0.05) than controls. Ad SoS was higher in schizophrenic men (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions Schizophrenic women in treatment with antipsychotic drugs had a loss of phalangeal bone mass that was associated with the levels of vitamin D or PTH. and increased bone turnover. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Soils, Ltd.

AB BackgroundRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by chronic inflammation and resultant cartilage/bone destruction because of aberrantly activated osteoclasts. Recently, novel treatments with several Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been shown to successfully ameliorate arthritis related inflammation and bone erosion, although their mechanisms of action for limiting bone destruction remain unclear. Here, we examined the effects of a JAK inhibitor on mature osteoclasts and their precursors by intravital multiphoton imaging.MethodsInflammatory bone destruction was induced by local injection of lipopolysaccharides into transgenic mice carrying reporters for mature osteoclasts or their precursors. Mice were treated with the JAK inhibitor, ABT 317, which selectively inhibits the activation of JAK1, and then subjected to intravital imaging with multiphoton microscopy. We also used RNA sequencing (RNA Seq) analysis to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of the JAK inhibitor on osteoclasts.ResultsThe JAK inhibitor, ABT 317, suppressed bone resorption by blocking the function of mature osteoclasts and by targeting the migratory behaviors of osteoclast precursors to the bone surface. Further exhaustive RNA Seq analysis demonstrated that Ccr1 expression on osteoclast precursors was suppressed in the JAK inhibitor treated mice; the CCR1 antagonist, J 113863, altered the migratory behaviors of osteoclast precursors, which led to the inhibition of bone destruction under inflammatory conditions.ConclusionsThis is the first study to determine the pharmacological actions by which a JAK inhibitor blocks bone destruction under inflammatory conditions; this inhibition is beneficial because of its dual effects on both mature osteoclasts and immature osteoclast precursors.

AB Osteoporosis is a metabolic disorder of reduced bone mass, accompanied by the deterioration of the bone microstructure, resulting in increased brittleness and easy fracture. Its pathogenesis can be explained by mainly excessive osteoclast formation or bone resorption hyperfunction. Oxidative stress is intricately linked with bone metabolism, and the maturation and bone resorption of osteoclasts respond to intracellular ROS levels. SIS3 is a small molecule compound that selectively suppresses Smad3 phosphorylation in the TGF beta/Smad signaling pathway and attenuates the ability to bind to target DNA. Several studies have reported that Smad3 plays a significant role in bone metabolism. However, whether SIS3 can modulate bone metabolism by affecting osteoclastogenesis and the specific molecular mechanisms involved remain unknown. Here, we demonstrated that SIS3 could suppress osteoclastogenesis and ameliorate bone loss in ovariectomized mice. Mechanistically, SIS3 inhibited Smad3 phosphorylation in BMMs, and the deficiency of phosphorylated Smad3 downregulated ROS production and Nox4 dependent expression during osteoclast formation, thereby blocking MAPK phosphorylation and the synthesis of downstream osteoclast marker proteins. Similarly, Nox4 plasmid transfection significantly alleviated osteoclast formation inhibited by SIS3. In addition, we identified the interaction region between Smad3 and Nox4 by ChIP and dual luciferase reporter assays. Collectively, we found that SIS3 could inhibit Smad3 phosphorylation, reduce Nox4 dependent ROS generation induced by RANKL, and prevent osteoclast differentiation and maturation, making it a promising alternative therapy for osteoporosis.

AB Renal bone disease occurs in patients with chronic kidney disease. There are changes in the concentrations of calcium, phosphate, vitamin D and parathyroid hormone. Systemic complications include renal osteodystrophy and soft tissue calcification, which contribute to morbidity and mortality. As the changes of renal bone disease are potentially modifiable, early referral to a nephrologist for monitoring and treatment is recommended. Early advice about diet and regular monitoring of calcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone are necessary. Careful prescribing of drugs and dialysis to achieve specific biochemical targets can minimise the complications. Phosphate binders and vitamin D analogues are required by most patients with advanced renal failure.

AB Inactivation of the thiazide sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) due to genetic mutations in Gitelman's syndrome (GS) or pharmacological inhibition with thiazide diuretics causes hypocalciuria and increased bone mineral density (BMD) with unclear extrarenal calcium (Ca2+) regulation. We investigated intestinal Ca2+ absorption and bone Ca2+ metabolism in nonsense Ncc Ser707X (S707X) homozygous knockin mice (Ncc(S707X/S707X) mice). Compared to wild type and heterozygous knockin littermates, Ncc(S707X/S707X) mice had increased intestinal absorption of Ca 45(2+) and expression of the active Ca2+ transport machinery (transient receptor potential vanilloid 6, calbindin D 9K, and plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase isoform 1b). Ncc(S707X/S707X) mice had also significantly increased Ca2+ content accompanied by greater mineral apposition rate (MAR) in their femurs and higher trabecular bone volume, cortical bone thickness, and BMD determined by CT. Their osteoblast differentiation markers, such as bone alkaline phosphatase, procollagen I, osteocalcin, and osterix, were also significantly increased while osteoclast activity was unaffected. Analysis of marrow derived bone cells, either treated with thiazide or directly cultured from Ncc S707X knockin mice, showed that the differentiation of osteoblasts was associated with increased phosphorylation of mechanical stress induced focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK). In conclusion, NCC inhibition stimulates duodenal Ca2+ absorption as well as osteoblast differentiation and bone Ca2+ storage, possibly through a FAK/ERK dependent mechanism.

AB Norzoanthamine (NZ), an alkaloid that has been isolated from the marine cnidiaria Zoanthus sp., has been shown an interesting anti osteoporotic activity. Although its mechanism of action is not yet clear, it seems that it is different from those of currently used drugs making it particularly interesting. Previous studies have been carried out mostly in vitro. Herein, we present an in vivo study that allows to check the real potential of NZ as a protector substance by direct application into ovariectomized rat bone using a sustained deliver y system. Histological and histomorphometric results in ovariectomized rats showed higher bone quality as a result of greater number of trabeculae and osteogenic activity in the group implanted with NZ, compared to controls. In contrast with the untreated controls, NZ treated groups showed a balanced osteoblast/osteoclast number ratio, similar to that found in the normal bone. These results suggest that NZ could be usef u l as adjunct to other osteoporosis treatments, but probably its main therapeutic role would be as preventive therapy against bone deterioration.

AB Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a pluripotent hematopoietic disorder that is currently considered incurable. The tyrosine kinase product of the Philadelphia chromosome, P210 BCR ABL, provided a pathogenetic explanation for the initiation of the CML chronic phase and is the molecular therapeutic target for the disease. Imatinib mesylate, an orally available BCR ABL kinase inhibitor, can induce haematologic and cytogenetic remission of CML. However, imatinib resistance occurs frequently, resulting in relapse. New treatment strategies are focusing on resistant CML stem cells and the bone marrow stroma. The identification of novel pathways and mechanisms in the bone marrow microenvironment could significantly contribute to the development of such strategies. In this work, we used a high resolution label free MSE proteomic approach to identify differential protein expression in the CML bone marrow plasma of responsive and resistant patients. Oxidative lipid metabolism and regulation of the switch from canonical to noncanonical WNT signaling may contribute to CML resistance in the bone marrow compartment.

AB Glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis (GIOP) represents the most prevalent form of secondary osteoporosis. Aucubin (AU), a principal active component found in traditional herbal medicines such as Eucommia ulmoides, has been demonstrated to enhance osteoblast differentiation. Nonetheless, the precise therapeutic effects of AU on GIOP and the complex underlying regulatory mechanisms warrant further investigation. We first established a GIOP model in female mice and then assessed the therapeutic effects of AU using micro CT analysis, biomechanical testing, measurements of serum calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) levels, and histological analyses using Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) and Masson staining. Subsequently, non targeted metabolomics was employed in order to study the effects of AU on serum metabolites in GIOP mice. The levels of the factors related to these metabolites were quantified using real time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) and western blot analyses. Finally, the effects of AU on osteoblastic and osteoclastic differentiation were examined. We found that AU significantly ameliorated bone microarchitecture and strength in GIOP mice. It mitigated pathological damages such as impairment of trabecular bone structure and reduction in collagen fibers, while concurrently elevating serum levels of Ca and P. Non targeted metabolomics revealed that Arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism serves as a common pathway between the control and GIOP groups, as well as between the high dose AU (AUH) and GIOP groups. AU notably upregulates prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1 (PTGES) expression and downregulates prostaglandin H2 D isomerase (PTGDS) expression. Furthermore, AU treatment increased the expression of runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and transcription factor Sp7 (Osterix), enhanced serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and reduced osteoclast expression. These results indicate that AU is a potential drug for treating GIOP, and its mechanism is related to regulating AA metabolism and promoting osteoblast differentiation. However, the key targets of AU in treating GIOP still need further exploration.

AB There is growing evidence that aminobisphosphonates like ibandronate show anticancer activity by an unknown mechanism. Biochemically, they prevent posttranslational isoprenylation of small GTPases, thus inhibiting their activity. In tumor cells, activated RAS GTPase, the founding member of the gene family, down regulates the expression of the pro apoptotic gene FAS via epigenetic DNA methylation by DNMT1. We compared ibandronate treatment in neoplastic human U 2 osteosarcoma and in mouse CCL 51 breast cancer cells as well as in the immortalized non neoplastic MC3T3 E1 osteoblastic cells. Ibandronate attenuated cell proliferation in all cell lines tested. In the neoplastic cells we found upregulation of caspases suggesting apoptosis. Further we found stimulation of FAS expression as a result of epigenetic DNA demethylation that was due to down regulation of DNMT1, which was rescued by reisoprenylation by both geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and farnesylpyrophosphate. In contrast, ibandronate did not affect FAS and DNMT1 expression in MC3T3 E1 non neoplastic cells. Data suggest that bisphosphonates via modulation of the activity of small GTPases induce apoptosis in neoplastic cells by DNA CpG demethylation and stimulation of FAS expression. In conclusion the shown epigenetic mechanism underlying the anti neoplastic activity of farnesyl transferase inhibition, also explains the clinical success of other drugs, which target this pathway.

AB Osteoporosis is a reduction in skeletal mass due to the decrease of osteogenic ability and the activation of the osteoclastic function. Inhibiting bone resorption and accelerating the new bone formation is a promising strategy to repair the bone defect of osteoporosis. In this study, we first systematically investigated the roles of Chinese medicine Asperosaponin VI (ASP VI) on osteogenic mineralization of BMSCs and osteoclastogenesis of BMMs, and then explored the synergistic effect of ASP VI and BS (BMP 2 immobilized in 2 N, 6 O sulfated chitosan) on bone formation. The result showed that ASP VI with the concentration lower than 10( 4) M contributed to the expression of osteogenic gene and inhibited osteoclastic genes RANKL of BMSCs. Simultaneously, ASP VI significantly reduced the differentiation of mononuclear osteoclasts in the process of osteoclast formation induced by M CSF and RANKL. Furthermore, by stimulating the SMADs, TGF beta 1, VEGFA, and OPG/RANKL signaling pathways, ASBS (ASP VI and BS) substantially enhanced osteogenesis, greatly promoted angiogenesis, and suppressed osteoclastogenesis. The findings provide a new perspective on osteoporosis care and prevention.

AB Background and Purpose
   Strontium ranelate, a drug approved and until recently used for the treatment of osteoporosis, mediates its effects on bone at least in part via the calcium sensing (CaS) receptor. However, it is not known whether bone targeted CaS receptor positive allosteric modulators (PAMs; calcimimetics) represent an alternative (or adjunctive) therapy to strontium (Sr o(2+)).
   Experimental Approach
   We assessed three structurally distinct calcimimetics [cinacalcet, AC 265347 and a benzothiazole tri substituted urea (BTU compound 13)], alone and in combination with extracellular calcium (Ca o(2+)) or Sr o(2+), in G protein dependent signalling assays and trafficking experiments in HEK293 cells and their effects on cell differentiation, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity and hydroxyapatite resorption assays in human blood derived osteoclasts.
   Key Results
   Sr o(2+) activated CaS receptor dependent signalling in HEK293 cells in a similar manner to Ca o(2+), and inhibited the maturation, TRAP expression and hydroxyapatite resorption capacity of human osteoclasts. Calcimimetics potentiated Ca o(2+)  and Sr o(2+) mediated CaS receptor signalling in HEK293 cells with distinct biased profiles, and only cinacalcet chaperoned an endoplasmic reticulum retained CaS mutant receptor to the cell surface in HEK293 cells, indicative of a conformational state different from that engendered by AC 265347 and BTU compound 13. Intriguingly, only cinacalcet modulated human osteoclast function, reducing TRAP activity and profoundly inhibiting resorption.
   Conclusion and Implications
   Although AC 265347 and BTU compound 13 potentiated Ca o(2+)  and Sr o(2+) induced CaS receptor activation, they neither replicated nor potentiated the ability of Sr o(2+) to inhibit human osteoclast function. In contrast, the FDA approved calcimimetic, cinacalcet, inhibited osteoclast TRAP activity and hydroxyapatite resorption, which may contribute to its clinical effects on bone mineral density.

AB Background The custom microenvironment 'vascular niche' is a potential therapeutic target for several pathophysiological conditions. Osteoblasts regulate the hematopoietic stein cell niche, and activation of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor can increase the number of cells mobilized into the bloodstream.
   Methods C57B1/6 mice were randomly assigned treatment with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G CSF), PTH, G CSF Plus PTH or saline. An mice underwent hindlimb ischemia. Blood flow was measured by laser Doppler imaging. Indices of capillary activity were determined 1)), electron microscopy in muscle tissue. CD34(+) and Ki67(+) cells were detected and evaluated by immunofluorescence, apoptosis by TUNEL, surface antigen and endothelial progenitor cells by fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis, and vascular endothelial growth factor 164 and angiopoietin 1 expression by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Frozen bone marrow sections were stained for antigen specific B cells and fibronectin and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy.
   Results Following mobilization induced by G CSF treatment, mice also treated with PTH showed increases in blood flow, capillary density, nitrite/nitrate release, angiogenic factors and circulating progenitor cells, as well as reduced apoptosis, fibrosis, oxidative stress and inflammation in ischemic muscles. Furthermore, hematopoietic antigen specific B cells in the bone marrov were also increased by G CSF alone and in combination with PTH.
   Conclusions PTH might increase the efficiency of hematopoietic stem cell based therapy in a recognized model of peripheral ischemia. Our translational experimental therapeutic targeting of the vascular niche points to novel clinical targets for the hematopoictic stem cell treatment of ischemic vascular diseases.

AB Age related bone loss is an important risk factor for fractures in the elderly; it results from an imbalance in bone remodeling mainly due to decreased bone formation. We have previously demonstrated that endogenous G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) driven Gi signaling in osteoblasts (Obs) restrains bone formation in mice during growth. Here, we launched a longitudinal study to test the hypothesis that G(i) signaling in Obs restrains bone formation in aging mice, thereby promoting bone loss. Our approach was to block G(i) signaling in maturing Obs by the induced expression of the catalytic subunit of pertussis toxin (PTX) after the achievement of peak bone mass. In contrast to the progressive cancellous bone loss seen in aging sex matched littermate control mice, aging female Col1(2.3)(+)/PTX+ mice showed an age related increase in bone volume. Increased bone volume was associated with increased bone formation at both trabecular and endocortical surfaces as well as increased bending strength of the femoral middiaphyses. In contrast, male Col1 (2.3)(+)/PTX+ mice were not protected from age related bone loss. Our results indicate that G(i) signaling markedly restrains bone formation at cancellous and endosteal bone surfaces in female mice during aging. Blockade of the relevant G(i) coupled GPCRs represents an approach for the development of osteoporosis therapies at least in the long bones of aging women.

AB Reprogramming somatic cells into an ESC like state, or induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, has emerged as a promising new venue for customized cell therapies. In this study, we performed directed differentiation to assess the ability of murine iPS cells to differentiate into bone, cartilage, and fat in vitro and to maintain an osteoblast phenotype on a scaffold in vitro and in vivo. Embryoid bodies derived from murine iPS cells were cultured in differentiation medium for 8 12 weeks. Differentiation was assessed by lineage specific morphology, gene expression, histological stain, and immunostaining to detect matrix deposition. After 12 weeks of expansion, iPS derived osteoblasts were seeded in a gelfoam matrix followed by subcutaneous implantation in syngenic imprinting control region (ICR) mice. Implants were harvested at 12 weeks, histological analyses of cell and mineral and matrix content were performed. Differentiation of iPS cells into mesenchymal lineages of bone, cartilage, and fat was confirmed by morphology and expression of lineage specific genes. Isolated implants of iPS cell derived osteoblasts expressed matrices characteristic of bone, including osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein. Implants were also stained with alizarin red and von Kossa, demonstrating mineralization and persistence of an osteoblast phenotype. Recruitment of vasculature and microvascularization of the implant was also detected. Taken together, these data demonstrate functional osteoblast differentiation from iPS cells both in vitro and in vivo and reveal a source of cells, which merit evaluation for their potential uses in orthopedic medicine and understanding of molecular mechanisms of orthopedic disease.

AB Despite progress in surgical and adjuvant therapy, a subset of patients with early stage breast cancer experience disease recurrence and/or distant metastases. Disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in the bone marrow are believed to be the source of late relapses in bone and other tissues. Bone is the most common site of breast cancer metastasis, and agents that modify the bone microenvironment could therefore affect the disease course. Bisphosphonates are an effective bone targeted therapeutic option for preventing cancer treatment induced bone loss (CTIBL) in pre  and postmenopausal women with breast cancer. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast mediated bone resorption, thereby inhibiting the release of growth factors necessary to promote cancer cell growth, differentiation, and tumor formation in bone. Preclinical and clinical data also suggest anticancer synergy between cytotoxic chemotherapy agents and bisphosphonates. Recent trials of zoledronic acid in the adjuvant setting in breast cancer have demonstrated reduced disease recurrence in bone and other sites. Currently, several ongoing clinical trials are evaluating whether antiresorptives can inhibit disease recurrence and the development of bone metastases from breast cancer. Based on recent data, the role of bisphosphonates in the breast cancer setting is expected to expand in the future. With recent changes to treatment guidelines, routine use of bisphosphonates to prevent bone loss during adjuvant therapy is likely to become standard practice, especially for patients receiving endocrine therapy. Furthermore, the use of zoledronic acid to reduce the risk of recurrence is emerging based on ongoing clinical research.

AB Bisphosphonates are a chemical class of compounds in widespread use since the 1970s for the management of disorders of bone metabolism, such as Pa. et's disease and osteoporosis. The members of this drug class share a common P C P backbone structure, where C is carbon and each P is a phosphonate group; the 2 phosphonate groups act as a "bone hook" and are essential for binding to hydroxyapatite. Individual bisphosphonates exhibit differential binding to hydroxyapatite and exert differential actions within osteoclasts. The unique structure of each bisphosphonate determines its efficacy and relative utility in treating specific disorders of bone resorption. The structure function profile of individual bisphosphonates is determined by the R 1 and R 2 side groups. Binding to bone is enhanced when R 1 is a hydroxyl group. The R 2 side group predominantly determines the antiresorptive potency of the bisphosphonates but has some effect on binding. The presence of nitrogen groups within the R 2 side group is associated with the ability of an individual bisphosphonate to inhibit farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase, a major enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Structural differences among bisphosphonates explain the observed differences in mineral binding and antiresorptive potency and may in turn account for some of the clinical differences that have been seen in potency, duration of effect, and antifracture efficacy among members of this drug class.

AB Wnt signaling plays an important role in embryogenesis and adult stem cell homeostasis. Its diminished activation is implicated in osteoporosis and degenerative neural diseases. However, systematic administration of Wnt signaling agonists carries risk, as aberrantly activated Wnt/beta catenin signaling is linked to cancer. Therefore, technologies for local modulation and control of Wnt signaling targeted to specific sites of disease or degeneration have potential therapeutic value in the treatment of degenerative diseases. We reported a facile approach to locally activate the canonical Wnt signaling cascade using nanomagnetic actuation or ligand immobilized platforms. Using a human embryonic kidney (HEK293) Luc TCF/LEF reporter cell line, we demonstrated that targeting the cell membrane Wnt receptor, Frizzled 2, with peptide tagged magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) triggered canonical Wnt signaling transduction when exposed to a high gradient, time varying magnetic field, and the induced TCF/LEF signal transduction was shown to be avidity dependent. We also demonstrated that the peptide retained signaling activity after functionalization onto glass surfaces, providing a versatile platform for drug discovery or recreation of the cell niche. In conclusion, these results showed that peptide mediated Wnt signaling kinetics depended not only on ligand concentration but also on the presentation method of the ligand, which may be further modulated by magnetic actuation. This has important implications when designing future therapeutic platforms involving Wnt mimetics.

AB Human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (hFPPS) controls the post translational prenylation of small GTPase proteins that are essential for cell signaling, cell proliferation, and osteoclast mediated bone resorption. Inhibition of hFPPS is a clinically validated mechanism for the treatment of lytic bone diseases, including osteoporosis and cancer related bone metastases. A new series of thienopyrimidine based bisphosphonates (ThP BPs) were identified that inhibit hFPPS with low nanomolar potency. Crystallographic evidence revealed binding of ThP BP inhibitors in the allylic subpocket of hFPPS. Simultaneous binding of inorganic pyrophosphate in the IPP subpocket leads to conformational closing of the active site cavity. The ThP BP analogues are significantly less hydrophilic yet exhibit higher affinity for the bone mineral hydroxyapatite than the current N BP drug risedronic acid. The antiproliferation properties of a potent ThB BP analogue was assessed in a multiple myeloma cell line and found to be equipotent to the best current N BP drugs. Consequently, these compounds represent a new structural class of hFPPS inhibitors and a novel scaffold for the development of human therapeutics.

AB Objective: Experimental and clinical data suggest that statins may protect bone by inhibiting bone resorption and/or stimulating bone formation. Interleukin 6 (IL 6) is produced by osteoblasts, and potently stimulates osteoclast activation playing a key role in normal bone resorption as well as in post menopausal and inflammation driven osteoporosis. Although statins inhibit IL 6 production from different cell types, currently no data exist on osteoblasts. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of rosuvastatin on IL 6 production by human osteoblasts.
   Methods: Osteoblasts from osteoarthritic patients were incubated with rosuvastatin (0.1 10 mu mol/L) +/  IL 1 beta, and IL 6 production was evaluated as cytokine concentration in the culture medium (ELISA), as well as mRNA expression in the cells (qPCR). Putative intracellular mechanisms of the drug, such as blocking HMG CoA reductase, and interference in the prenylation process were investigated by the addition of mevalonate and isoprenoids. The effect of rosuvastatin +/  IL 1 beta on the anti resorptive molecule osteoprotegerin (OPG) was also assessed (ELISA).
   Results: Rosuvastatin significantly reduced IL 6 levels in the osteoblast culture medium, both in unstimulated and IL 1 beta stimulated cells. This effect was reversed by mevalonate or geranylgeraniol, but not farnesol. Moreover, the drug decreased both spontaneous and IL 1 beta induced IL 6 mRNA expression in osteoblasts. Conversely, rosuvastatin did not affect OPG levels in the culture medium.
   Conclusion: Our results show that rosuvastatin decreases IL 6 production by osteoblasts, thereby suggesting a possible inhibiting activity on osteoclast function in an indirect way. These data may provide further rationale for employing rosuvastatin to beneficially affect bone metabolism in post menopausal women and possibly in inflammation driven osteoporosis.

AB There has been increasing interest in adjunctive use of anti inflammatory drugs to control periodontitis. This study was performed to examine the effects of pirfenidone (PFD) on alveolar bone loss in ligature induced periodontitis in mice and identify the relevant mechanisms. Experimental periodontitis was established by ligating the unilateral maxillary second molar for 7 days in mice (n = 8 per group), and PFD was administered daily via intraperitoneal injection. The micro computed tomography and histology analyses were performed to determine changes in the alveolar bone following the PFD administration. For in vitro analysis, bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) were isolated from mice and cultured with PFD in the presence of RANKL or LPS. The effectiveness of PFD on osteoclastogenesis, inflammatory cytokine expression, and NF kappa B activation was determined with RT PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence analyses. PFD treatment significantly inhibited the ligature induced alveolar bone loss, with decreases in TRAP positive osteoclasts and expression of inflammatory cytokines in mice. In cultured BMM cells, PFD also inhibited RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation and LPS induced proinflammatory cytokine (IL 1 beta, IL 6, TNF alpha) expression via suppressing the NF kappa B signal pathway. These results suggest that PFD can suppress periodontitis progression by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory cytokine production via inhibiting the NF kappa B signal pathway, and it may be a promising candidate for controlling periodontitis.

AB The bone marrow microenvironment harbors and protects leukemic cells from apoptosis inducing agents via mechanisms that are incompletely understood. We previously showed SDF 1 (CXCL 12), a chemokine readily abundant within the bone marrow microenvironment, induces apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells that express high levels of the SDF 1 receptor CXCR4. However, differentiating osteoblasts found within this niche protect cocultured AML cells from apoptosis. Additionally, this protection was abrogated upon treatment of the differentiating osteoblasts with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). In this study, we begin to characterize and target the molecular mechanisms that mediate this osteoblast protection. Quantitative RT PCR revealed that HDACi treatment of differentiating osteoblasts (mouse MC3T3 osteoblast cell line) reduced expression of multiple genes required for osteoblast differentiation, including genes important for producing mineralized bone matrix. Interestingly, pretreating differentiating osteoblasts with cyclosporine A, a drug known to inhibit osteoblast differentiation, similarly impaired osteoblast mediated protection of cocultured AML cells (KG1a and U937 human AML cell lines). Both HDACi and cyclosporine A reduced osteoblast expression of the key mineralization enzyme tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP; encoded by Alp!). Moreover, specifically reducing TNAP expression or activity in differentiating osteoblasts significantly impaired the ability of the osteoblasts to protect cocultured AML cells. Together, our results indicate that inhibiting osteoblast matrix mineralization by specifically targeting TNAP is sufficient to significantly impair osteoblast mediated protection of AML cells. Therefore, designing combination therapies that additionally target the osteoblast produced mineralized bone matrix may improve treatment of AML by reducing the protection of leukemic cells within the bone marrow microenvironment.

AB Osteosarcoma (OS) is a type of malignant tumor arising from soft tissues of bone and displays poor prognosis in most cases. However, the molecular mechanism by which OS initiates and progresses is still not completely elucidated. miR 155 has been shown to be overexpressed in OS specimen and cell lines. Our study is intended to explore the role of miR 155 in OS etiology. The data confirmed that miR 155 abundance is higher in OS samples than non cancerous bone tissue. Inhibition of miR 155 suppressed the proliferation of OS cells and cell cycle progression in vitro, and the growth of OS xenografts in vivo. Wnt pathway was suppressed in OS cells by miR 155 inhibitors. HMG box transcription factor 1 (HBP1), a strong Wnt pathway suppressor, was found to be a target of miR 155. Restoration of HBP1 abolished the effect of miR 155 on OS cells. Finally, miR 155 levels in OS tissues and serum are both inversely associated with the survival of OS patients. Collectively, miR 155 was identified to be among the list of OS related oncogenic miRNAs, and HBP1 mediated Wnt signaling is involved with the role of miR 155 in OS progression.

AB Osteoclast stimulatory transmembrane protein (OC STAMP) plays a pivotal role in the promotion of cell fusion during osteoclast differentiation (osteoclastogenesis) in the context of pathogenic bone resorption. Thus, it is plausible that the suppression of OC STAMP through a bioengineering approach could lead to the development of an effective treatment for inflammatory bone resorptive diseases with minimum side effects. Here, we synthesized two types of spermine bearing (Spe) cationic glucan dendrimer (GD) gels (with or without C12) as carriers of short interfering RNA (siRNA) to silence OC STAMP. The results showed that amphiphilic C12 GD Spe gel was more efficient in silencing OC STAMP than GD Spe gel and that the mixture of anti OC STAMP siRNA/C12 GD Spe significantly downregulated RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis. Also, local injection of anti OC STAMP siRNA/C12 GD Spe could attenuate bone resorption induced in a mouse model of periodontitis. These results suggest that OC STAMP is a promising target for the development of a novel bone regenerative therapy and that C12 GD Spe gel provides a new nanocarrier platform of gene therapies for osteolytic disease.

AB Connective tissue tumors comprise a rich array of subtypes, many of which possess strong pathognomonic phenotypes and genotypes of therapeutic significance. This article describes recent applications of targeted and nontargeted therapeutic agents in connective tissue tumors that illustrate important themes in drug development. Targeted therapy has exploited the paradigms of oncogene and lineage addiction. In other cases, potential targets are more difficult to classify, such as the role of the insulin like growth factor 1 pathway in Ewing's sarcoma. Understanding why these pathways seem critical in some cancers, and in some individuals but not others, is important in identifying novel therapeutic opportunities in an age of personalized medicine.

AB Objective: Descriptions of mandibular distraction osteogenesis for tissue replacement after oncologic resection or for defects caused by osteoradionecrosis have been limited. Previous work demonstrated radiation decreases union formation, cellularity and mineral density in mandibular distraction osteogenesis. The authors posit that intermittent systemic administration of parathyroid hormone will serve as a stimulant to cellular function, reversing radiation induced damage and enhancing bone regeneration.
   Methods: Twenty male Lewis rats were randomly assigned to three groups: group 1 (radiation and distraction osteogenesis, n = 7) and group 2 (radiation, distraction osteogenesis, and parathyroid hormone, n = 5) received a human equivalent dose of 35 Gy of radiation (human bioequivalent, 70 Gy) fractionated over 5 days. All groups, including group 3 (distraction osteogenesis, n = 8), underwent a left unilateral mandibular osteotomy with bilateral external fixator placement. Distraction osteogenesis was performed at a rate of 0.3 mm every 12 hours to reach a gap of 5.1 mm. Group 2 was injected with parathyroid hormone (60 mu g/kg) subcutaneously daily for 3 weeks after the start of distraction osteogenesis. On postoperative day 40, all left hemimandibles were harvested. Biomechanical response parameters were generated. Statistical significance was considered at p <= 0.05.
   Results: Parathyroid hormone treated mandibles had significantly higher failure load and higher yield than did untreated mandibles. However, these values were still significantly lower than those of nonirradiated mandibles.
   Conclusions: The authors have successfully demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of parathyroid hormone to stimulate and enhance bone regeneration in their irradiated murine mandibular model of distraction osteogenesis. Anabolic regimens of parathyroid hormone, a U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved drug on formulary, significantly improve outcomes in a model of postoncologic craniofacial reconstruction.

AB Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in the treatment of diseases. After their in vivo application, MSCs undergo apoptosis and release apoptotic vesicles (apoVs). This study investigates the role of apoVs derived from human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMMSCs) in bone metabolism and the molecular mechanism of the observed effects. The results show that apoVs can promote osteogenesis and inhibit osteoclast formation in vitro and in vivo. ApoVs may therefore attenuate the bone loss caused by primary and secondary osteoporosis and stimulate bone regeneration in areas of bone defect. The mechanisms responsible for apoV induced bone regeneration include the release of miR1324, which inhibit expression of the target gene Sorting Nexin 14 (SNX14) and thus activate the SMAD1/5 pathway in target cells. Given that MSC derived apoVs are easily obtained and stored, with low risks of immunological rejection and neoplastic transformation, The findings suggest a novel therapeutic strategy to treat bone loss, including via cell free approaches to bone tissue engineering.

AB Osteoporotic patients have lower bone mass due to increased bone resorption by osteoclasts. The aim of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic and anti osteoclastogenic effects of geraniol, a natural monoterpene on human CD14+ monocytes (ex vivo) and murine RAW264.7 macrophages (in vitro) using alamar blue and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase staining respectively. The anti osteoclastogenic activity of geraniol was further explored by analyzing its effects on actin ring formation and bone resorptive function of osteoclasts. Geraniol significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited osteoclast formation in CD14+ monocytes and RAW264.7 macrophages without cytotoxicity. Moreover, reduced osteoclastogenesis in these cells led to an arrest in actin ring formation and diminished bone resorption. Analysis of underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that geraniol alleviated NF kB activity, an indispensable upstream modulator of osteoclast formation. Furthermore, expression of key osteoclastogenic genes such as dendritic cell specific transmembrane protein (DC STAMP) involved in cell cell fusion and nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin dependent 1 (NFATc1), a master transcription factor essential for osteoclast differentiation was downregulated by geraniol. These observations indicate that inhibition of osteoclast differentiation is presumably one of the pharmacological properties of geraniol.

AB Osteoporosis disproportionately affects older women, yet gender differences in human osteoblasts remain unexplored. Identifying mechanisms and biomarkers of osteoporosis will enable the development of preventative and therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome data of 187 osteoblast samples from men and women were compared. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and weighted gene co expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to discover co expressed modules. Enrichment analysis was performed to annotate DEGs. Preservation analysis determined whether modules and pathways were similar between genders. Blood methylation, transcriptome data, mouse phenotype data, and drug treatment data were utilized to identify key osteoporosis genes. We identified 1460 DEGs enriched in immune response, neurogenesis, and GWAS osteoporosis related genes. WGCNA uncovered 8 modules associated with immune response, development, collagen metabolism, mitochondrion, and amino acid synthesis. Preservation analysis indicated modules and pathways were generally similar between genders. Incorporating GWAS and mouse phenotype data revealed 9 key genes, including GMDS, SMOC2, SASH1, MMP2, AHCYL1, ARRDC2, IGHMBP2, ATP6V1A, and CTSK. These genes were differentially methylated in patient blood and differentiated high and low bone mineral density patients in pre  and postmenopausal women. Denosumab treatment in postmenopausal women down regulated 6 key genes, up regulated T cell proportions, and down regulated fibroblast proportion. qRT PCR was used to confirm the genes in postmenopausal women. We identified 9 key osteoporosis genes by comparing the transcriptome of osteoblasts in women and men. Our findings' clinical implications were confirmed by multi omics data and qRT PCR, and our study provides novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for osteoporosis diagnosis and treatment.

AB Traditional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as phenytoin, decrease bone mineral density (BMD) and increase the risk of bone fracture in patients with epilepsy. In this study, we examined the eff ects of perampanel, a novel antiepileptic drug, on bone metabolism by bone histomorphometry. Following daily oral administration of either phenytoin (30 mg/kg) or perampanel (3.0 mg/kg) for 6 weeks, we performed bone histomorphom etric analysis at the proximal tibial metaphysis of 6 week old male C57BL/6 mice. A significant decrease in bone structure parameters such as the trabecular bone volume, trabecular thickness, and trabecular number was observed in the phenytoin group. These deteriorations of bone structure due to the administration of phenytoin were accompanied by a signifi cant increase in the eroded surface per bone surface (ES/BS) and osteoclast number per bone surface (N.Oc/BS). In contrast, no signifi cant change in bone structure parameters was observed in the perampanel group. However, compared to that in the control group, a signifi cant decrease in bone formation parameters such as the osteoblast surface and mineral apposition rate occurred, additionally the ES/BS and N.Oc/BS were signifi cantly increased in the perampanel group. These fi ndings of this study suggest that perampanel may suppress bone formation and enhance bone resorption. Perampanel induced failure of bone remodeling may have an adverse eff ect on bone volume with further long term use. In the future, it would be necessary to conduct research studies to elucidate the detailed mechanism underlying the bone remodeling eff ect of perampanel.

TI Curculigoside attenuates oxidative stress and osteoclastogenesis via
   modulating Nrf2/NF κB signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Curculigo orchioides Gaertn is used for the treatment of impotence, atrophic debility of bones (osteoporosis), limb limpness, and arthritis of the lumbar and knee joints in traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medical system. Curculigoside (Cur) from Curculigo orchioides Gaertn has been shown to have regulatory effects on bone metabolism via anti oxidative activities in rats and osteoblasts. However, little is known about the molecular pharmacological activity of Cur in osteoclastic bone resorption.
   Aim: The aim of this work is to investigate the inhibitory effect of Cur against osteoclasts (OCs) under the oxidative stress status, and explore the possible underlying mechanism.
   Materials and methods: OCs were induced from RAW264.7 cells using RANKL and H2O2. The number of OCs was measured by tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. F Actin and nuclear translocation of P65 and Nrf2 were stained with immunofluorescence assay and observed under a laser confocal microscope. The biochemical parameters of OCs were detected with an ELISA kit. The expression of Nrf2 and NF kappa B pathway related proteins was analyzed by Western Blot.
   Results: Cur inhibited the TRAP activity, release of degrading products from bone slices and the expression of NFATc1, c Fos, Cathepsin K (Ctsk) and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) of OCs induced with RANKL and H2O2. In addition, Cur suppressed the ROS level and NADPH oxidase 1(NOX1) and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) activities of OCS. More importantly, Cur enhanced the expression and nucleus translocation of Nrf2 and activities of its regulatory cytoprotective enzymes, and reduced the NF kappa B expression and phosphorylation and nucleus translocation of p65 in OCs. Furthermore, the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 and NF kappa B inhibitor Bayll 7082 counteracted the effect of Cur in OCs.
   Conclusion: Cur mitigated oxidative stress and osteoclastogenesis by activating Nrf2 and inhibiting the NF kappa B pathway, suggesting that Cur may prove to be a promising candidate for the treatment of osteoporosis. Our findings may also help partially explain the rationale behind the traditional use of Curculigo orchioides Gaertn.

AB Aim: In the present study, we investigated the effects of pharmacological serum from the ovariectomized mice treated with Bushen Ningxin Decoction (BSNXD) on cell growth and etoposide induced apoptosis Of Mouse osteoblasts (OBs).
   Methods: The ovariectomized BALB/c mice serving as a postmenopausal osteoporosis model were treated with BSNXD for 12 weeks. The serum from the mice was collected and applied to the cultivation of the calvaria OBs of newborn BALB/c litters. Cell proliferation was measured by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Apoptosis rate was analyzed by Annexin V FITC/PI flow cytometry (FCM) and the expression of pERK1/2 was measured by Western blot.
   Results: The calvaria OBs treated with BSNXD serum showed more potent ability for cell proliferation than control groups (serum from the ovariectomized mice treated with saline). The BSNXD serum inhibited the etoposide induced apoptosis of the OBs, with the effective concentrations of 10 20%. While being pretreated with the selective inhibitor of ERK1/2 U0126, the anti apoptosis effect of the pharmacological serum on the OBs was almost completely blocked. Meanwhile, the expression of phosphor pERK1/2 decreased significantly.
   Conclusion: The BSNXD pharmacological serum promoted the proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis of the mouse OBs, which might be through the activation of MAPK signal transduction pathways and ERK1/2 activation via phosphoration of ERK. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bisphosphonates such as alendronate and zoledronate are blockbuster drugs used to inhibit osteoclast mediated bone resorption. Although the molecular mechanisms by which bisphosphonates affect osteoclasts are now evident, the exact route by which they are internalized by cells is not known. To clarify this, we synthesized a novel, fluorescently labeled analog of alendronate (AF ALN). AF ALN was rapidly internalized into intracellular vesicles in J774 macrophages and rabbit osteoclasts; uptake of AF ALN or [C 14]zoledronate was stimulated by the presence of Ca2+ and Sr2+ and could be inhibited by addition of EGTA or clodronate, both of which chelate calcium ions. Both EGTA and clodronate also prevented the bisphosphonate induced inhibition of Rap1A prenylation, an effect that was reversed by addition of Ca2+. In J774 cells and osteoclasts, vesicular AF ALN colocalized with dextran ( but not wheat germ agglutinin or transferrin), and uptake of AF ALN or [C 14] zoledronate was inhibited by dansylcadaverine, indicating that fluid phase endocytosis is involved in the initial internalization of bisphosphonate into vesicles. Endosomal acidification then seems to be absolutely required for exit of bisphosphonate from vesicles and entry into the cytosol, because monensin and bafilomycin A1, both inhibitors of endosomal acidification, did not inhibit vesicular uptake of AF ALN or internalization of [C 14] zoledronate but prevented the inhibitory effect of alendronate or zoledronate on Rap1A prenylation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that cellular uptake of bisphosphonate drugs requires fluid phase endocytosis and is enhanced by Ca2+ ions, whereas transfer from endocytic vesicles into the cytosol requires endosomal acidification.

AB In the PaTH trial, among the 119 women randomized to parathyroid hormone PTH( 1   84) and 60 to alendronate, we found much greater variation in BMD and markers in response to PTH( 1   84) compared to alendronate. No baseline participant characteristic consistently predicted increased bone density response to PTH( 1   84), although women with larger changes in 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D during therapy had larger increases in BMD.
   Introduction We examined variability in BMD and markers of bone turnover in response to treatment with PTH( 1   84) or alendronate in the PaTH trial.
   Methods Differences in SD were examined using Levine's test for homogeneity of variance. Change in BMD across quartiles of participant characteristics was examined using ANOVA.
   Results We found much greater variation in response to PTH( 1   84) compared to alendronate. The SD for change in cancellous spine BMD ( by QCT) was 32% on PTH( 1   84) compared to 13% on alendronate ( p < 0.0001). The higher variability in the PTH( 1   84) group was due to substantial numbers of women with large increases in BMD on PTH ( 1   84). Similarly, the SD of changes in markers of formation and resorption were significantly higher on PTH( 1   84) than on ALN. No baseline participant characteristics predicted increased bone density response to PTH ( 1   84) therapy. However, change in 1,25 OH2D explained 16% of the variance in BMD response to PTH( 1   84).
   Conclusion There is significant variability in the skeletal response to PTH( 1   84), which exceeds that observed with alendronate. Changes in 1,25 OH2D were related to larger gains in BMD. This finding may have implications for elucidating either the pathway by which PTH affects the skeleton or traits that result in particular responsiveness to PTH therapy.

AB The role of osteoblasts in peri articular bone loss and bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has gained much attention, and microRNAs are hypothesized to play critical roles in the regulation of osteoblast function in RA. The aim of this study is to explore novel microRNAs differentially expressed in RA osteoblasts and to identify genes potentially involved in the dysregulated bone homeostasis in RA. RNAs were extracted from cultured normal and RA osteoblasts for sequencing. Using the next generation sequencing and bioinformatics approaches, we identified 35 differentially expressed microRNAs and 13 differentially expressed genes with potential microRNA mRNA interactions in RA osteoblasts. The 13 candidate genes were involved mainly in cell matrix adhesion, as classified by the Gene Ontology. Two genes of interest identified from RA osteoblasts, A kinase anchoring protein 12 (AKAP12) and leucin rich repeat containing 15 (LRRC15), were found to express more consistently in the related RA synovial tissue arrays in the Gene Expression Omnibus database, with the predicted interactions with miR 183 5p and miR 146a 5p, respectively. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified AKAP12 as one of the genes involved in protein kinase A signaling and the function of chemotaxis, interconnecting with molecules related to neovascularization. The findings indicate new candidate genes as the potential indicators in evaluating therapies targeting chemotaxis and neovascularization to control joint destruction in RA.

AB Purpose or Objective Osteosarcoma is well known for its high incidence in children and adolescents and long term bone pain, which seriously reduces the life quality of patients. Cisplatin (CDDP), as the first line anti osteosarcoma drug, has been used in many anticancer treatments. At the same time, the serious side effects of platinum (Pt) drugs have also attracted widespread attention. To accurately deliver Pt drugs to the lesion site and realize controlled release of Pt drugs, certain modified delivery systems have been extensively studied. Methods Among them, liposomes have been approved for clinical cancer treatment due to their highly biocompatibility and superior modifiability. Here, we developed a bone targeted dual functional lipid coated drug delivery system, lipid coated CDDP alendronate nanoparticles (LCA NPs) to target the bone and precisely deliver the drugs to the tumor site. Cell toxicity, apoptosis and cellular uptake were detected to evaluate the anticancer effect for LCA NPs. Furthermore, transwell assay and wound healing assay were conducted to estimate the osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion. Hemolysis assay was utilized to assess the biocapitibility of the kind of NPs. Results With the aim of bone targeted unit alendronate (ALD), LCA NPs serve as a rich bone homing Pt delivery system to exert efficient anticancer effects and synergistically reduce bone resorption and bone loss potentially. Conclusions By providing a highly biocompatible platform for osteosarcoma therapy, LCA NPs may help to significantly enhance the anticancer effect of Pt and greatly reduce the systemic toxicity and side effects of Pt towards osteosarcoma.

AB Osteoporosis is characterized by reductions in bone mass, which could be attributed to the dysregulation of bone homeostasis, such as the loss of balance between bone resorbing osteoclasts and bone forming osteoblasts. Elevated levels of oxidative stress increase bone resorption by promoting osteoclastogenesis and inhibiting the osteogenesis. Ginkgolide B (GB), a small natural molecule from Ginkgo biloba, has been reported to possess pharmacological activities by regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aging related degenerative diseases. Herein, we assessed the therapeutic effects of GB on the bone phenotypes of mice with osteoporosis induced by (I) aging, (II) ovariectomy, and (III) glucocorticoids. In all three animal models, oral gavage of GB significantly improved bone mass consistent with the increase in the OPG to RANKL ratio. In the in vitro experiments, GB promoted osteogenesis in aged mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and repressed osteoclastogenesis in aged macrophages by reducing ROS. The serum protein profile in GB treated aged mice revealed moderate rejuvenating effects; signaling pathways associated with ROS were also regulated. The anabolic and anti catabolic effects of GB were illustrated by the reduction in ROS. Our results indicate that GB is effective in treating osteoporosis. The use of GB in patients with osteoporosis is worthy of further clinical investigation.

DE BP; prosthetic replacement; cellular mechanism; adjuvant therapy
AB aseptic loosening after prosthetic replacement is the primary cause of shortened service life and lowered stability of prosthesis, and increased revision rate after joint replacement. Factors of causing the loosening of joint prosthesis include mechanical factors and biological factors. The mechanical effect of bisphosphonates (BP) is quite obvious, which can enhance osteocyte function, accelerate the generation of new bone and lower bone resorption activity. of osteoclast and macrophage. In animal experiment and adjuvant therapy of patients after joint replacement, BP also shows up the functions of reducing osteolysis induced by wear debris, preventing stress shielding and interface fretting and enhancing bone,density. This paper elaborated the mechanism of BP adjusting bone metabolism, and analyzed the action principle and the vital function of it in prosthetic replacement. It has proved that BP can effectively reduce the early pen prosthesis bone absorption after total hip replacement and improve bone mass pen prosthesis. It is currently the significant choice of preventing bone lose of pen prosthesis after operation.

TI 7 HYB, a Phenolic Compound Isolated from Myristica fragrans Houtt
   Increases Cell Migration, Osteoblast Differentiation, and Mineralization

AB The seeds (nutmegs) of Myristica fragrans Houtt have been used as popular spices and traditional medicine to treat a variety of diseases. A phenolic compound, ((7S) 8 ' (benzo[3 ',4 ']dioxol 1 ' yl) 7 hydroxypropyl)benzene 2,4 diol (7 HYB) was isolated from the seeds of M. fragrans. This study aimed to investigate the anabolic effects of 7 HYB in osteogenesis and bone mineralization. In the present study, 7 HYB promotes the early and late differentiation of MC3T3 E1 preosteoblasts. 7 HYB also elevated cell migration rate during differentiation of the preosteoblasts with the increased phosphorylation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including ERK1/2, p38, and JNK. In addition, 7 HYB induced the protein level of BMP2, the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, and the expression of RUNX2. 7 HYB also inhibited GSK3 beta and subsequently increased the level of beta catenin. However, in bone marrow macrophages (BMMs), 7 HYB has no biological effects in cell viability, TRAP positive multinuclear osteoclasts, and gene expression (c Fos and NF ATc1) in receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand (RANKL) induced osteoclastogenesis. Our findings suggest that 7 HYB plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation through the BMP2 and beta catenin signaling pathway. It also indicates that 7 HYB might have a therapeutic effect for the treatment of bone diseases such as osteoporosis and periodontitis.

AB Advanced prostate cancer (PCa) often develops bone metastasis, for which therapies are very limited and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We report that bone borne TGF beta induces the acetylation of transcription factor KLF5 in PCa bone metastases, and acetylated KLF5 (Ac KLF5) causes osteoclastogenesis and bone metastatic lesions by activating CXCR4, which leads to IL 11 secretion, and stimulating SHH/IL 6 paracrine signaling. While essential for maintaining the mesenchymal phenotype and tumorigenicity, Ac KLF5 also causes resistance to docetaxel in tumors and bone metastases, which is overcome by targeting CXCR4 with FDA approved plerixafor. Establishing a mechanism for bone metastasis and chemoresistance in PCa, these findings provide a rationale for treating chemoresistant bone metastasis of PCa with inhibitors of Ac KLF5/CXCR4 signaling. The therapies for bone metastatic prostate cancer are limited and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, the authors show that bone derived TGF beta induces acetylation of KLF5 (Ac KLF5), and Ac KLF5 promotes prostate cancer bone metastasis and resistance to docetaxel by upregulating CXCR4.

AB Morin is a natural compound isolated from moraceae family members and has been reported to possess a range of pharmacological activities. However, the effects of morin on bone associated disorders and the potential mechanism remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the anti osteoclastogenic effect of morin in vitro and the potential therapeutic effects on ovariectomy (OVX) induced osteoporosis in vivo. In vitro, by using a bone marrow macrophage derived osteoclast culture system, we determined that morin attenuated receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF) kappa B ligand (RANKL) induced osteoclast formation via the inhibition of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), NF kappa B and calcium pathways. In addition, the subsequent expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) and c fos was significantly suppressed by morin. In addition, NFATc1 downregulation led to the reduced expression of osteoclastogenesis related marker genes, such as V ATPase d2 and Integrin beta 3. In vivo, results provided that morin could effectively attenuate OVX induced bone loss in C57BL/6 mice. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that morin suppressed RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis via the NF kappa B, MAPK and calcium pathways, in addition, its function of preventing OVX induced bone loss in vivo, which suggested that morin may be a potential therapeutic agent for postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment.

AB While recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP) 2 based bone therapy presents potential osteoinductivity, it also leads concern due to transient osteoclast activation during early healing periods, ultimately limiting its clinical use. Therefore, we investigated in vivo and in vitro rhBMP 2 signaling which mediates early bone resorbing effect, depending on the dose, and attempted to inhibit this resorption phenomenon using NFAT inhibitor as a target molecule. High dose of rhBMP 2 (20 mu g/defect) enhanced osteoclast activation and the expression of bone resorption markers, compared to low dose (5 mu g/defect) at one week after surgery in collagen sponge delivered rat calvarial defect models. Interestingly, this trend was also observed in the expression of bone formation markers. In particular, rhBMP 2 upregulated RANKL expression, while it downregulated osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression, resulting in a dose dependent increase in the ratio of RANKL to OPG. NFAT inhibitor (150 mu m) treatment in vivo suppressed the high dose effect of rhBMP 2 on both resorption and formation. In vitro results of rhBMP 2 signaling and NFAT inhibitor effects in rat mesenchymal stem cells showed similar trends as in vivo results. Microcomputer tomography based evaluation at 4 weeks showed that combined treatment of NFAT inhibitor with 20 mu g rhBMP 2 in vivo increased bone volume (BV) more than 20 mu g rhBMP 2 alone, which showed little difference in BV compared to 5 mu g of rhBMP 2. These results demonstrated that rhBMP 2 implantation concurrently signalized into enhanced osteoclastogenesis and osteoblasto genesis in vivo, dose dependently. Ratio of RANKL/OPG might be an index for early bone resorbing activity of implanted rhBMP 2. A local cocktail treatment of NFAT inhibitor and high dose rhBMP 2 might be an alternative to overcome early bone resorbing effects, thereby accelerating bone formation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Denosumab treatment for progressive skull base giant cell tumor of bone
   in a 14 year old female   a case report and literature review

AB Background: Giant cell tumor of bone (GCT) is a rare primary bone tumor, which can metastasize and undergo malignant transformation. The standard treatment of GCT is surgery. In patients with unresectable or metastatic disease, additional therapeutic options are available. These include blocking of the receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand (RANKL) signaling pathway, which plays a role in the pathogenesis of GCT of bone, via the anti RANKL monoclonal antibody denosumab.
   Case Presentation: Herein we report on a female teenager who presented in a very poor clinical condition (cachexia, diplopia, strabismus, dysphonia with palsy of cranial nerves V, VI, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII) due to progressive disease, after incomplete resection and adjuvant radiotherapy, of a GCT which affected the cervical spine (C1 and C2) as well as the skull base; and who had an impressive clinical response to denosumab therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the youngest patient ever reported with a skull base tumor treated with denosumab.
   Conclusion: In situations when surgery can be postponed and local aggressiveness of the tumor does not urge for acute surgical intervention, upfront use of denosumab in order to reduce the tumor size might be considered. Principally, the goal of denosumab therapy is to reduce tumor size as much as possible, with the ultimate goal to make local surgery (or as in our case re surgery) amenable. However, improvement in quality of life, as demonstrated in our patient, is also an important aspect of such targeted therapies.

TI 2 NPPA Mitigates Osteoclastogenesis via Reducing TRAF6 Mediated c fos

AB Excessive bone resorption leads to bone destruction in pathological bone diseases. Osteoporosis, which occurs when osteoclast mediated bone resorption exceeds osteoblast mediated bone synthesis, is regarded a global health challenge. Therefore, it is of great importance to identify agents that can regulate the activity of osteoclasts and prevent bone diseases mediated mainly by bone loss. We screened compounds for this purpose and found that 2 (2 chlorophenoxy) N [2 (4 propionyl 1piperazinyl) phenyl] acetamide (2 NPPA) exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on osteoclastogenesis. 2 NPPA suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of several osteoclast specific markers and blocked the formation of mature osteoclasts, reducing the F actin ring formation and bone resorption activity. In a cell signaling point of view, 2 NPPA exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) and c fos expression in vitro and prevented ovariectomy induced bone loss in vivo. These findings highlighted the potential of 2 NPPA as a drug for the treatment of bone loss mediated disorders.

AB Icariin (ICA) is a major active ingredient in Herba epimedii, which is commonly used as a Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of osteoporosis. Previous studies have revealed that ICA exerted a protective effect against bone loss and increased bone regeneration; however, the association between ICA and estrogen receptor (ER) signaling remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of ICA on rat bone marrow stromal cells (rBMSCs). Cell Counting Kit 8 assays were conducted to measure proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was evaluated to assess osteoblast differentiation, and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction as well as western blotting were performed to detect the expression of cellular and molecular markers of osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation. The results demonstrated that treatment of rBMSCs with 10( 6) M ICA stimulated rBMSC proliferation and ALP activity. Furthermore, ICA treatment increased the expression of the osteogenic markers runt related transcription factor 2, collagen type 1 and bone morphogenetic Protein 2; however, it also decreased the expression of the adipogenic differentiation markers peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha. Treatment of rBMSCs with ICI182780, an ER antagonist, blocked the effects of ICA. Taken together, these findings indicated that ICA may stimulate osteoblast differentiation and inhibit adipogenic differentiation via the activation of the ER signaling pathway. Therefore, ICA has the potential to serve as a therapeutic alternative for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.

AB The benefits of increased human lifespan depend upon duration of healthy, independent living; the healthspan. Bone wasting disorders contribute significantly to loss of independence, frailty, and morbidity in older people. Therefore, there is an unmet need globally for lifestyle interventions to reduce the likelihood of bone fractures with age. Although many mechanisms are involved in disorders of bone loss, there is no single regulatory pathway and, therefore, there is no single treatment available to prevent their occurrence. Our aim in these studies was to determine whether fasting/feeding interventions alter the effect of mechanical loading on bone anabolic activities and increase bone mass. In young 17 week old mice, 16 hour fasting period followed by reintroduction of food for 2 hours increased markedly the potency of mechanical loading, that mimics the effect of exercise, to induce new cortical bone formation. Consistent with this finding, fasting and re feeding increased the response of bone to a loading stimulus that, alone, does not stimulate new bone formation in ad lib fed mice. Older mice (20 months) experienced no potentiation of loading induced bone formation with the same timing of feeding interventions. Interestingly, the pre , prandial, and postprandial endocrine responses in older mice were different from those in young animals. The hormones that change in response to timing of feeding have osteogenic effects that interact with loading mediated effects. Our findings indicate associations between timing of food ingestion and bone adaptation to loading. If translated to humans, such non pharmacological lifestyle interventions may benefit skeletal health of humans throughout life course and in older age.

AB Two of the most commonly used immunosuppressants, cyclosporine A and tacrolimus (FK506), inhibit the activity of a ubiquitously expressed Ca2+/calmodulin sensitive phosphatase, calcineurin. Because both drugs also cause profound bone loss in humans and in animal models, we explored whether calcineurin played a role in regulating skeletal remodeling. We found that osteoblasts contained mRNA and protein for all isoforms of calcineurin A and B. TAT assisted transduction of fusion protein TAT calcineurin A alpha into osteoblasts resulted in the enhanced expression of the osteoblast differentiation markers Runx 2, alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin. This expression was associated with a dramatic enhancement of bone formation in intact calvarial cultures. Calcineurin A alpha( / ) mice displayed severe osteoporosis, markedly reduced mineral apposition rates, and attenuated colony formation in 10 day ex vivo stromal cell cultures. The latter was associated with significant reductions in Runx2, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin expression, paralleled by similar decreases in response to FK506. Together, the gain  and loss of function experiments indicate that calcineurin regulates bone formation through an effect on osteoblast differentiation.

AB Background: Malignant breast cancer cells trigger the over activation of osteoclast precursor cells, leading to bone loss and severe pain. Targeted inhibition of osteoclast differentiation has emerged as an important strategy for treating bone syndromes induced by breast cancer. Purpose: The objective is to discover natural osteoclast inhibitor to treat osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction induced by breast cancer, and clarify the specific mechanisms. Methods: Recepteur d'origine Nantais (RON) protein was employed to search the natural osteoclast inhibitor for breast cancer induced osteoclastogenesis by molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). In the in vitro experiment, breast cancer MDA MB 231 cell conditioned medium (MDA MB 231 CM) was used to induce osteoclastogenesis in murine bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs), aiming to elucidate the effects and mechanisms of the natural osteoclast inhibitor. In the in vivo model, MDA MB 231 cells was injected into the mouse tibia to evaluate the therapeutic effect of drug on breast cancerinduced bone destruction. Results: We discovered a significant increase in the expression of RON during MDA MB 231 CM induced osteoclast differentiation in vitro. Molecular docking analysis found that oroxylin A (OA), a flavonoid derived from the Chinese medicine Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, showed binding ability with RON, while its impact and mechanism on breast cancer induced osteoclastogenesis and osteolysis remains unclear. Molecular dynamics simulation and CETSA further revealed that OA bound directly to the RON protein, and it also decreased RON expression in breast cancer CM induced osteoclastogenesis. Correspondingly, OA suppressed the MDA MB 231 CM induced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in vitro. The downstream signals of RON including Src and NFATc1, as well as the osteoclast specific genes, were downregulated by OA. Of interesting, the suppressive effect of OA on osteoclastogenesis induced by MDA MB 231 CM was abolished after RON was knocked down by the specific RON siRNA, this further confirmed that OA showed inhibitory effects on osteoclasts through targeting RON. In addition, we found that OA attenuated MDA MB 231 cell induced osteolysis and reduced the number of osteoclasts in vivo. Conclusion: Our results indicate that OA acts as a natural RON inhibitor to suppress breast cancer induced osteoclastogenesis and osteolysis. This provides new strategy for treating breast cancer induced bone destruction and related syndromes.

AB Background: Iguratimod, a small molecular drug, has been proven to have effective bone protection for treatment of patients with bone loss related diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the exact bone protective mechanism of iguratimod remains to be determined. The purpose of this study was to better explore the underlying mechanism of bone protection of iguratimod.
   Methods: Bone marrow monocytes from C57/BL6 mice were stimulated with either RANKL or TNF alpha plus M CSF. The effects of iguratimod on morphology and function of osteoclasts were confirmed by TRAP staining and bone resorption assay, respectively. The expression of osteoclast related genes was detected by RT PCR and the activation of signal pathway was detected by Western blotting. We used rodent models of osteoporosis (ovariectomy) and of arthritis (modified TNF alpha induced osteoclastogenesis) to evaluate the osteoprotective effect of iguratimod in vivo.
   Results: Iguratimod potently inhibited osteoclast formation in a dose dependent manner at the early stage of RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis, whereas iguratimod had no effect on M CSF induced proliferation and RANK expression in bone marrow monocytes. Bone resorption was significantly reduced by both early and late addition of iguratimod. Administration of iguratimod prevented bone loss in ovariectomized mice. The blockage of osteoclastogenesis elicited by iguratimod results from abrogation of the p38, ERK and NF kappa B pathways induced by RANKL. Importantly, Iguratimod also dampened TNF alpha induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro and attenuated osteoclasts generation in vivo through disrupting NF kappa B late nuclear translocation without interfering with I kappa B alpha degradation.
   Conclusions: Iguratimod not only suppresses osteoclastogenesis by interfering with RANKL and TNF alpha signals, but also inhibits the bone resorption of mature osteoclasts. These results provided promising evidence for the therapeutic application of iguratimod as a unique treatment option against RA and especially in prevention of bone loss.

AB Objective: This study aims to elucidate the therapeutic effect of Vorinostat (SAHA), one of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDIs), against osteoporosis in vitro and in vivo, and its mechanism in Wnt signal pathway. Method: In the study, western blotting, cytochemistric and histochemistry staining and ChIP PCR methods were used to explore whether SAHA induces MCT3T3 E1 cells osteogenic differentiation, and its action in Wnt pathway activation. The authors also build an ovariectomized rat model to mimic osteoporosis disease. ELISA was employed to study HDIs or saline on osteoporosis prevention in ovariectomized rats. Results: It showed that SAHA increased ALP activity and promoted MC3T3 E1 cells towards terminal osteoblast differentiation in vitro. Additionally, SAHA induced genomic wide H3 and H4 acetylation and activated the Wnt/beta catenin signal pathway. RT PCR results indicated that TCF1 expression level increased significantly after SAHA treatment (P<0.01). In ovariectomized rat study, serum Dkk 1 level dropped significantly in SAHA treatment (i.p.) compared with DNSO group (P<0.01). The bone mature biomarkers, ALP and RUNX2, increased in bone marrow cells. The accumulation of beta catenin within cells indicates SAHA activates Wnt pathway to promote osteoblast osteogenic differentiation. Conclusion: SAHA promotes osteoblasts osteogenic differentiation through reducing Dkk 1 expression and activating Wnt/beta catenin signal pathway. It could be regarded as a potential agent for the prevention and therapy against osteoporosis.

AB Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass and increased susceptibility to fracture. Recent in vitro studies showed that strontium ranelate, a novel agent containing two strontium atoms, acts as an effective anti osteoporotic drug by inhibiting bone resorption by osteoclasts and promoting osteololast replication and bone formation. Studies in animals demonstrated that strontium ranelate increases bone mass, microarchitecture and strength in intact rodents and prevents bone loss in osteopenic animals. Clinical studies show that strontium ranelate reduces the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal osteoporosis. Together, these recent advances point to unique effects of strontium ranelate on bone cells and show that strontium ranelate has significant clinical benefits in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

AB Bisphosphonates are a class of drugs of proven efficacy in the prevention and treatment of various bone diseases, affecting bone turnover by decreasing bone resorption by different mechanisms. In recent years, this class of drugs has become the target of numerous studies in relation to oral and maxillofacial surgery. The aim of this paper is to review the literature on the effects of bisphosphonates in this context, especially in the development of osteonecrosis and as adjuvant in implant placement, osteogenic distraction and bone grafting surgery.

AB Cancer patients with bone metastases (BMets) are predisposed to skeletal complications. Bone targeted therapies such as denosumab or intravenous bisphosphonates (IVBs) reduce the risk of these complications. This study characterized patterns of IVB use in these patients in the USA.
   This was a retrospective, observational study using the Truven Health MarketScanA (R) Commercial and Medicare databases (2002 2011). Subjects with a parts per thousand yen1 claims of diagnosis of breast, lung, or prostate cancer (BC, LC, or PC) and a parts per thousand yen1 claims of BMets diagnosis were included. The date of first BMet diagnosis claim was the "index date." Key exclusion criteria were diagnosis of other primary cancer, receipt of IVB, or < 6 months continuous enrollment pre index. Cumulative incidence of treatment initiation, interruption, and discontinuation were estimated. Proportions of IVB claims with chemotherapy administered on the same day and with renal monitoring within 2 weeks prior were summarized. Multivariate regressions assessing factors associated with IVB initiation were conducted.
   Cumulative incidence of IVB initiation at 12 months post index was greatest for BC followed by PC and LC, and it declined with age in all tumor types, e.g., in BC from 62 % at age < 50 years to 47 % at age a parts per thousand yen75 years. At 12 months, IVB treatment interruption ranged from 16 % (LC) to 31 % (PC), with discontinuation ranging from 46 % (BC) to 83 % (LC).
   IVBs are used more frequently in patients with BMets secondary to BC than PC or LC. Many patients interrupt or discontinue IVB therapy within 12 months of initiation potentially impacting effectiveness.

AB Cordyceps militaris is a medicinal mushroom and its bioactive compound, cordycepin, is reported to have many pharmacological activities. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of C. militaris extract (CME) and cordycepin on osteoclast differentiation in vitro and on an inflammatory bone loss in vivo. In RAW 264.7 cells, CME and cordycepin showed dose dependent inhibition of receptor activator of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) ligand (RANKL) induced osteoclast differentiation by TRAP (tartrate resistant acid phosphatase) staining. Moreover, the mRNA expression of osteoclastogenesis related genes (TRAP, cathepsin K, MMP 9, and NFATc1) was also inhibited by CME and cordycepin. Also, cordycepin significantly inhibited RANKL induced phosphorylation of p38 and NF kappa B, but not that of other members of mitogen activated protein kinase families. To examine the effect of CME on bone loss in vivo, we used a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mediated bone loss. Micro CT analysis of the femurs showed that LPS treatment caused bone loss. However, bone loss was significantly attenuated in mice treated with CME. These results suggest that cordycepin or/and CME have inhibitory effects on osteoclast differentiation in vitro and that they suppress inflammatory bone loss in vivo.

AB Bone fractures are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with diabetes, who have a high incidence of fractures and exhibit poor fracture healing. Coordinated expression of osteoblast derived vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) is essential for fracture repair. The NO/cGMP/protein kinase G (PKG) signaling pathway mediates osteoblast responses to estrogens and mechanical stimulation, but the pathway's role in bone regeneration is unknown. Here, we used a mouse cortical defect model to simulate bone fractures and studied osteoblast specific PKG1 knockout and diabetic mice. The knockout mice had normal bone microarchitecture but after injury exhibited poor bone regeneration, with decreased osteoblasts, collagen deposition, and microvessels in the bone defect area. Primary osteoblasts and tibiae from the knockout mice expressed low amounts of Vegfa and Bmp2/4 mRNAs, and PKG1 was required for cGMP stimulated expression of these genes. Diabetic mice also demonstrated low Vegfa and Bmp2/4 expression in bone and impaired bone regeneration after injury; notably, the cGMP elevating agent cinaciguat restored Vegfa and BMP2/4 expression and full bone healing. We conclude that PKG1 is a key orchestrator of VEGF and BMP signaling during bone regeneration and propose pharmacological PKG activation as a novel therapeutic approach to enhance fracture healing.

AB Electrophilic reactive intermediates resulting from drug metabolism have been associated with toxicity and off target effects and in some drug discovery programs trigger NO GO decisions. Many botanicals and dietary supplements are replete with such reactive electrophiles, notably Michael acceptors, which have been demonstrated to elicit chemo preventive mechanisms; and Michael acceptors are gaining regulatory approval as contemporary cancer therapeutics. Identifying protein targets of these electrophiles is central to understanding potential therapeutic benefit and toxicity risk. NO donating NSAID prodrugs (NO NSAIDs) have been the focus of extensive clinical and preclinical studies in inflammation and cancer chemoprevention and therapy: a subset exemplified by pNO ASA, induces chemopreventive mechanisms following bioactivation to an electrophilic quinone methide (QM) Michael acceptor. Having previously shown that these NO independent, QM donors activated Nrf2 via covalent modification of Keap 1, we demonstrate that components of canonical NF kappa B signaling are also targets, leading to the inhibition of NF kappa B signaling. Combining bio orthogonal probes of QM donor ASA prodrugs with mass spectrometric proteomics and pathway analysis, we proceeded to characterize the quinonorne: the protein cellular targets of QM modification by pNO ASA and its ASA pro drug congeners. Further comparison was made using a biorthogonal probe of the "bare bones", Michael acceptor, and clinical anti inflammatory agent, dimethyl fumarate, which we have shown to inhibit NF kappa B signaling. Identified quinonome pathways include post translational protein folding, cell death regulation, protein transport, and glycolysis; and identified proteins included multiple heat shock elements, the latter functionally confirmed by demonstrating activation of heat shock response.

AB One effective treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis is to inhibit osteoclasts and subsequent bone resorption. In our study, we demonstrated that acacetin, a flavone with potential therapeutic effects in infections, cancers, and several metabolic disorders, inhibited osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption in vitro. For improving the efficacy of acacetin in vivo, we developed an acid sensitive bone targeting delivery system composed of an acid sensitive linker (N epsilon maleimidocaproic acid hydrazide, EMCH) for ensuring an effective release of acacetin at the site of action and a hydrophilic aspartic acid hexapeptide ((Asp)6, D6) as the effective bone targeting agent. Our results revealed that Acacetin EMCH D6 specifically bound to the bone surface once administrated in vivo, prolonged the retention time in bone and released acacetin at the osteoclastic bone resorption sites where the acidity is higher. We further demonstrated that, in ovariectomy induced osteoporosis mice, treatment with Acacetin EMCH D6 inhibited osteoclast formation and increased trabecular bone mass. On the contrary, neither acacetin nor EMCH D6 with the same dosage alone showed significant anti osteoporosis effects in vivo. Mechanistically, targeted delivery of acacetin to the bone resorption sites by Acacetin EMCH D6 inhibited autophagy through activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in osteoclasts, while the activation of autophagy by rapamycin partially reversed the inhibitory effects of acacetin in vitro and in vivo. In summary, our study, for the first time, showed that the acid sensitive bone targeting delivery system carrying acacetin was effective for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Thus, targeted delivery of acacetin using Acacetin EMCH D6 to bone resorption sites is a promising therapy for osteoporosis.

AB The regulation of stem cell directional differentiation is a core research topic in regenerative medicine, and modulating the fate of stem cells is a promising strategy for precise intervention through the utilization of naturally small molecule compounds. The present study aimed to explore the potential pro osteogenic differentiation effect of galangin, a flavonoid derived from Alpinia officinarum, on human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) and the underlying molecular mechanism. The results showed that galangin had no cytotoxicity towards hAMSCs when the concentration was less than 50 mu M. Treatment with 10 mu M galangin significantly increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) secretion and calcium deposition in hAMSCs. Meanwhile, galangin upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of early osteoblast specific markers, namely ALP, RUNX2, and OSX, and late osteoblast specific markers, CoL1a1, OPN, and OCN, in hAMSCs. Furthermore, signaling pathway screening studies showed that galangin enhanced the phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). In addition, molecular docking results suggest there is a promising interaction between galangin and JAK2. Finally, treatment with the JAK2 specific inhibitor AG490 effectively reversed the induction of osteogenic differentiation, upregulation of osteoblast specific marker expression, and activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling induced by galangin. These results show that galangin induces the osteogenic differentiation of hAMSCs through the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and could serve as a promising small molecular osteoinducer for application to hAMSCs in regenerative medicine.

AB Objective To investigate the effect of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor inhibition in a mouse model of autoantibody mediated arthritis.
   Methods Arthritis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by K/BxN serum transfer. Arthritic mice were treated with the LPA receptor antagonist, Ki16425 and arthritis severity was assessed clinically and histologically. Expression of inflammatory mediators in joints was identified by a mouse cytokine array and validated by western blot and real time PCR assays. Effects of treatment with LPA receptor antagonist or with small interfering RNA on bone metabolism were assessed by in vitro assays of osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption, osteoblasts differentiation and bone mineralisation.
   Results Mice treated with the LPA receptor antagonist Ki16425 showed attenuated arthritis characterised by reduction of synovial inflammation, cartilage damage and, more markedly, bone erosion. We detected increased apoptosis, reduction of inflammatory mediators and of bone remodelling proteins in arthritic joints from mice treated with Ki16425. In addition, we demonstrated that inhibition or suppression of LPA(1) receptor reduces osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption and, on the contrary, it promotes differentiation of osteoblasts and bone mineralisation.
   Conclusions Pharmacological inhibition of LPA(1) receptor in the K/BxN serum transfer arthritis model led to reduction of severity of arthritis involving multiple mechanisms, increased apoptosis, reduced inflammatory mediators and proteins involved in bone remodelling, that show LPA(1) as a very promising target in rheumatoid arthritis treatment.

AB It has been shown that bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) display defective proliferative potential. We have probed the impaired replicative capacity of culture expanded MSCs in MDS patients (n = 30) compared with healthy subjects (n = 32) by studying senescence characteristics and gene expression associated with WNT/transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) signaling pathways. We have also explored the consequences of the impaired patient MSC proliferative potential by investigating their differentiation potential and the capacity to support normal CD34(+) cell growth under coculture conditions. Patient MSCs displayed decreased gene expression of the senescence associated cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN1A, CDKN2A, and CDKN2B, along with PARG1, whereas the mean telomere length was upregulated in patient MSCs. MDS derived MSCs exhibited impaired capacity to support normal CD34(+) myeloid and erythroid colony formation. No significant changes were observed between patients and controls in gene expression related to TGFB1 pathway. Patient MSCs displayed upregulated non canonical WNT expression, combined with downregulated canonical WNT expression and upregulated canonical WNT inhibitors. MDS derived MSCs displayed defective osteogenic and adipogenic lineage priming under non differentiating culture conditions. Pharmacological activation of canonical WNT signaling in patient MDSs led to an increase in cell proliferation and upregulation in the expression of early osteogenesis related genes. This study indicates abnormal WNT signaling in MSCs of MDS patients and supports the concept of a primary MSC defect that might have a contributory effect in MDS natural history.

AB Endothelin 1 (ET 1) is a potent vasoconstrictor that also stimulates cells in the osteoblast lineage by binding to the endothelin A receptor (ETAR). ET 1 ligand is widely secreted, particularly by the vasculature. However, the contributions of ETAR signaling to adult bone homeostasis have not been defined. ETAR was inactivated in osteoblasts by crossing ETAR floxed and osteocalcin Cre mice. Histomorphometric analyses were performed on 4 , 8 , and 12 week old osteoblast targeted ETAR knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) male and female mice. Tibial trabecular bone volume was significantly lower from 12 weeks in KO versus WT mice in both males and females. Bone formation rate, osteoblast density, and in vitro osteoblast differentiation were reduced by targeted inactivation of ETAR. A separate longitudinal analysis was performed between 8 and 64 weeks to examine the effect of aging and castration on bone metabolism in ETAR KO mice. Hypogonadism did not change the rate of bone accrual in WT or KO females. However, eugonadal KO males had a significantly larger increase in tibial and femoral bone acquisition than WT mice. Male mice castrated at: 8 weeks of age showed the reverse: KO mice had reduced rates of tibial and femoral BMD acquisition compared with WT mice. In vitro, ET 1 increased osteoblast proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Dihydrotestosterone also increased osteoblast differentiation using a mechanism distinct from the actions of ET 1. These results demonstrate that endothelin signaling in osteoblasts is an important regulator of postnatal trabecular bone remodeling and a modulator of androgen effects on bone.

AB Osteoporosis is a result of the imbalance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts quantities, which is closely correlated with osteogenic differentiation (OD). Leucocyte cell derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) has been reported as a regulatory factor in some chronic diseases such as hepatitis through mediating downstream target gene beta catenin. Additionally, Wnt/beta catenin is also the crucial modulatory signal pathway in OD. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) is a kind of mesodermal stem cells; its differentiation direction is discovered affected by Wnt/beta catenin. However, the function of LECT2 in osteoporosis still remains exploration, which encourages us to lucubrate its functional effect in regulating the OD of MSCs. In this study, we found that LECT2 was expressed at low level in MSCs with osteogenic differentiation, and knockdown of LECT2 would activate Wnt/beta catenin pathway and therefore promoting OD in MSCs. It is the first time to report that LECT2 participates in regulating OD via mediating Wnt/beta catenin. Our discovery would affirmatively help provide a novel strategy for the diagnosis and therapy methods for osteoporosis.

AB Osteoporosis (OP) is mainly manifested by bone loss and bone degeneration. OP is considered a risk factor for pathological fractures, as well as impacts the health of middle aged and elderly individuals. Drug therapy remains the main treatment scheme for OP; however, its efficacy is limited and has been associated with serious side effects. Therefore, it is important to develop new, effective, and safe treatment methods for OP. Avicularin (AL) is a flavonoid and quercetin derivative from various plants. Our study showed that AL disrupts osteoclast activation and resorptive function via inhibition of the RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation together with the resorption capacity of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs). Hence, AL prevents the activation and resorptive activity of osteoclasts. The results of qPCR showed that genes related to osteoclasts exhibited downregulated expression after AL treatment. Furthermore, AL inhibited RANKL induced phosphorylation as well as degradation of the inhibitor I kappa Ba of the NF kappa B pathway, together with P65 phosphorylation in BMMs. We used an OP mouse model that was established by ovariectomy (OVX). Relative to untreated OP mice, mice that received AL treatment showed a significant increase in bone mineral density; however, the expression of TRAP, NFATC1, mmp9, and CTX 1 was significantly reduced. These results indicate that AL disrupts osteoclastogenesis via inhibition of the NF kappa B pathway, which in turn improves OVX induced OP.

AB Osteoporosis is characterized by an abnormal bone structure with low bone mass and degradation of microarchitecture. Oxidative stress induces imbalances in osteoblast and osteoclast activity, leading to bone degradation, a primary cause of secondary osteoporosis. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely used chemotherapy drug for treating cancer, known to induce secondary osteoporosis. The mechanism underlying DOX induced bone loss is still not fully understood, but one of the relevant mechanisms is through a massive accumulation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (i.e., ROS and NOS) leading to oxidative stress. We investigated the effects of antioxidants Resveratrol and MitoTEMPO on DOX induced bone impairment using the zebrafish model. DOX was shown to increase mortality, promote skeletal deformities, induce alterations on intestinal villi, impair growth and mineralization and significantly downregulate osteoblast differentiation markers osteocalcin 2 and osterix/sp7. Lipid peroxidation was significantly increased in DOX supplemented groups as compared to control and antioxidants, suggesting ROS formation as one of the key factors for DOX induced bone loss. Furthermore, DOX affected mineral contents, suggesting an altered mineral metabolism. However, upon supplementation with antioxidants, DOX induced effects on mineral content were rescued. Our data show that supplementation with antioxidants effectively improves the overall growth and mineralization in zebrafish and counteracts DOX induced bone anomalies.

AB Recent advances in the understanding of prostate cancer biology and its progression to bone metastasis have led to the development of drugs directed against precise molecular alterations in the prostate tumor cell and host cells in the normal bone environment such as osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Endothelins (ETs), and their receptors have emerged as a potential target in prostate cancer bone metastasis. By activating the ETA receptor, ET 1 is pathogenically involved in facilitating Several aspects of prostate cancer progression, including proliferation, escape from apoptosis invasion, and new bone formation, processes that are general to many malignancies, Notwithstanding, there are a number of features specifically driven by the ET axis in prostate has creating and perpetuating a unique interaction between the metastatic prostate cancer cell and the bone microenvironment (osteoblast osteoclast, and stroma) or altering the equilibrium in pain modulation. These features have led to the preferential clinical evaluation of atrasentan (ABT 627) as a biological therapy in prostate carcinoma, first in hormone refractory prostate cancer. Biological activity of atrasentan in patients with prostate cancer has been shown by the suppression of biochemical markers of prostate cancer progression in bone, and clinical activity is evidenced by a consistent trend demonstrating a delay in time to disease progression when compared with placebo, especially in patients with bone metastases. Further studies of atrasentan and other selective ET 1 antagonists (ZD4054) are ongoing.

AB Objective: Dragon's Blood resin (DBR) is a traditional medicinal substance renowned for its diverse pharmacological effects, which consists of potent anti inflammatory, antioxidant and angiogenic properties. This study aimed to elucidate its therapeutic mechanism in alleviating steroid induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SIONFH).Methods: Techniques such as SPR and LC MS were employed to identify and analyze the target proteins of DBR in bone marrow macrophages (BMMs). In vitro, BMMs were treated with RANKL and DBR, and TRAcP staining and actin belt staining were utilized to assess osteoclast activity. The inhibitory effects and underlying mechanisms of DBR on osteoclastogenesis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were determined using real time PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. An in vivo SIONFH rat model was set up to assess the curative impacts of DBR using micro CT scanning and pathological staining.Results: Bioinformatic tools revealed a pivotal role of osteoclast differentiation in SIONFH. Proteomic analysis identified 164 proteins binding in BMMs. In vitro assessments demonstrated that DBR hindered osteoclastogenesis by modulating the expression of specific genes and proteins, along with antioxidant proteins including TRX1 and Glutathione Reductase. Notably, the resin effectively inhibited the expression of crucial proteins, such as the phosphorylation of JNK and the nuclear localization of p65 within the TRAF6/JNK and NF?B signaling pathways. In vivo experiments further confirmed that DBR mitigated the onset of SIONFH in rats by curbing osteoclast and ROS activities.Conclusion: These findings underscore the potential of Dragon's Blood as an effective administration for early stage SIONFH, shedding light on its therapeutic influence on ROS mediated osteoclastic signaling pathways.

AB The increasing resistance of malarial parasites to almost all available drugs calls for the identification of new compounds and the detection of novel targets. Here, we establish the antimalarial activities of risedronate, one of the most potent bisphosphonates clinically used to treat bone resorption diseases, against blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] of 20.3 +/  1.0 mu M). We also suggest a mechanism of action for risedronate against the intraerythrocytic stage of P. falciparum and show that protein prenylation seems to be modulated directly by this drug. Risedronate inhibits the transfer of the farnesyl pyrophosphate group to parasite proteins, an effect not observed for the transfer of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Our in vivo experiments further demonstrate that risedronate leads to an 88.9% inhibition of the rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei in mice on the seventh day of treatment; however, risedronate treatment did not result in a general increase of survival rates.

AB Background: Barbaloin, found in Aloe vera, exerts broad pharmacological activities, including antioxidant, anti inflammatory, and anti cancer. This study aims to investigate the effects of barbaloin on the osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs).
   Methods: Osteogenic induction of hBMSCs was performed in the presence or absence of barbaloin. Cell viability was determined by using the CCK 8 assay. The characteristic of hBMSCs was identified by using flow cytometry. Intracellular alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining was performed to evaluate the ALP activity in hBMSCs. Alizarin Red S staining was performed to evaluate the matrix mineralization. The mRNA and protein levels of target genes were determined using qRT PCR and western blotting, respectively.
   Results: Treatment with barbaloin (10 and 20 mu g/mL) significantly increased cell viability of hBMSCs after 72 hours. In addition, treatment with barbaloin increased the mRNA expression levels of ALP and its activities. Treatment with barbaloin also increased matrix mineralization and the mRNA and protein levels of late differentiated osteoblast marker genes BMP2, RUNX2, and SP7 in hBMSCs. The underlying mechanisms revealed that barbaloin increased the protein expressions of Wnt/beta catenin pathway related biomarkers.
   Conclusion: Barbaloin promotes osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs by the regulation of the Wnt/beta catenin signaling pathway.

AB There is no disease modifying therapy for osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that is projected to afflict more than 67 million individuals in the United States alone by 2030. Because disease pathogenesis is associated with inappropriate articular chondrocyte maturation resembling that seen during normal endochondral ossification, pathways that govern the maturation of articular chondrocytes are candidate therapeutic targets. It is well established that parathyroid hormone (PTH) acting via the type 1 PTH receptor induces matrix synthesis and suppresses maturation of chondrocytes. We report that the PTH receptor is up regulated in articular chondrocytes after meniscal injury and in osteoarthritis in humans and in a mouse model of injury induced knee osteoarthritis. To test whether recombinant human PTH(1 34) (teriparatide) would inhibit aberrant chondrocyte maturation and associated articular cartilage degeneration, we administered systemic teriparatide (Forteo), a Food and Drug Administration approved treatment for osteoporosis, either immediately after or 8 weeks after meniscal/ligamentous injury in mice. Knee joints were harvested at 4, 8, or 12 weeks after injury to examine the effects of teriparatide on cartilage degeneration and articular chondrocyte maturation. Microcomputed tomography revealed increased bone volume within joints from teriparatide treated mice compared to saline treated control animals. Immediate systemic administration of teriparatide increased proteoglycan content and inhibited articular cartilage degeneration, whereas delayed treatment beginning 8 weeks after injury induced a regenerative effect. The chondroprotective and chondroregenerative effects of teriparatide correlated with decreased expression of type X collagen, RUNX2 (runt related transcription factor 2), matrix metalloproteinase 13, and the carboxyl terminal aggrecan cleavage product NITEGE. These preclinical findings provide proof of concept that Forteo may be useful for decelerating cartilage degeneration and inducing matrix regeneration in patients with osteoarthritis.

AB Clinical observations have implicated the antiretroviral drug tenofovir with bone density loss during the management of HIV infection. The goal of this study was to investigate the in vitro effects of tenofovir exposure of primary osteoclasts in order to gain insights into the potential mechanisms for the drug induced bone density loss. We hypothesized that tenofovir may alter the expression of key genes involved in osteoclast function. To test this, primary osteoclasts were exposed to physiologically relevant concentrations of the prodrug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), then intensive microarray analysis was done to compare tenofovir treated versus untreated cells. Specific downregulation of Gnas, Got2 and Snord32a were observed in the TDF treated cells. The functions of these genes help to explain the basis for tenofovir associated bone density loss. Our studies represent the first analysis of the effects of tenofovir on osteoclast gene expression and help to explain the basis of tenofovir associated bone density loss in HIV infected individuals.

AB Rapid bone regeneration is crucial for restoring alveolar bone and oral functions following periodontal diseases. However, the development of effective biomedical materials for this purpose remains insufficient. While bone autografts can enhance bone regeneration, they are invasive to healthy areas. Specifically, for alveolar bone regeneration, the implanted material must possess adequate mechanical strength. Moreover, local administration is preferred for older adults, who are a primary target population, to maintain their quality of life. We developed a silica substituted carbonate apatite (CO(3)Ap silica) block as newly bone substitute with a bone growth factor, featuring the major inorganic component of mature bone to enhance bone regeneration. CO(3)Ap silica block stimulated the bone remodeling process at the implantation site and demonstrated significantly better bone regeneration compared to currently used carbonate apatite substitutes. Therefore, this new material is expected to advance technologies for restoring occlusal function after periodontal disease. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB Human myeloma bone disease (MBD) occurs when malignant plasma cells migrate to the bone marrow and commence inimical interactions with stromal cells, disrupting the skeletal remodeling process. The myeloma cells simultaneously suppress osteoblastic bone formation while promoting excessive osteoclastic resorption. This bone metabolism imbalance produces osteolytic lesions that cause chronic bone pain and reduce trabecular and cortical bone structural integrity, and often culminate in pathological fractures. Few bone models exist that enable scientists to study MBD and the effect therapies have on restoring the bone metabolism imbalance. The purpose of this research was to develop a well characterized three dimensional (3D) bone organoid that could be used to study MBD and current or potential treatment options. First, bone marrow stromal cell derived osteoblasts (OBs) mineralized an endosteal like extracellular matrix (ECM) over 21 days. Multiple analyses confirmed the generation of hydroxyapatite (HA) rich bone like tissue fragments that were abundant in alkaline phosphatase, calcium, and markers of osteoblastic gene expression. On day 22, bone marrow macrophage (BMM) derived osteoclasts (OCs) were introduced to enhance the resorptive capability of the model and recapitulate the balanced homeostatic nature of skeletal remodeling. Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAcP 5b), type I collagen C telopeptide (CTX 1), and gene expression analysis confirmed OC activity in the normal 3D organoid (3D in vitro model of normal bonelike fragments [3D NBF]). On day 30, a human multiple myeloma (MM) derived plasmacytoma cell line was introduced to the 3D NBF to generate the 3D myeloma bone disease organoid (3D MBD). After 12 days, the 3D MBD had significantly reduced total HA, increased TRAcP 5b levels, increases levels of CTX 1, and decreased expression of osteoblastic genes. Therapeutic intervention with pharmaceutical agents including an immunomodulatory drug, a bisphosphonate, and monoclonal restored HA content and reduced free CTX 1 in a dose dependent manner. This osteogenically functional model of MBD provides a novel tool to study biological mechanisms guiding the disease and to screen potential therapeutics.

AB Background Optimal use of bone modifying agent (BMA) therapy in patients with bone metastases from breast and castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is evolving. Methods Patients receiving BMA for bone metastases from breast or CRPC were surveyed. Information was collected on patient and disease characteristics, BMA treatments and perceptions regarding BMA benefits and side effects. Interest in participation in trials of de escalated BMA therapy was also gauged. Results Of 220 patients contacted, 172 eligible patients responded (response rate 78%). Median age was 67 (range: 21 91); 137 (80%) had breast cancer and 35 (20%) CRPC. Symptomatic skeletal events (SSEs) occurred prior to starting BMAs in 61% (84/137) of breast and 48% (17/35) of CRPC patients. Among breast cancer patients, 47, 33 and 13% received zoledronate, pamidronate and denosumab, respectively. Eighty five percent (30/35) of CRPC patients received denosumab. De escalation of therapy was more common among breast cancer patients. Although most patients correctly reported the goals of BMA therapy were to "help stop fractures" (62%) and "[improve] quality of life" (63%), 46.5% felt it prolonged survival and 54% felt it reduced bone progression. Most respondents (102/129, 79%) were comfortable with de escalating to 6 monthly treatment after 2 years of BMA therapy. Patients considered the most important endpoints of de escalation studies to be "stability of bone metastases" (45%), "quality of life" (22%) and "SSE rates" (14%). Conclusion Twelve weekly BMA was more common in breast than in prostate cancer. There remain misconceptions about the benefits of BMAs, highlighting potential gaps in patient education. Patients were interested in further BMA de escalation after 2 years of prior BMA and provided study endpoints that were most important to them.

AB Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent joint disease worldwide, making it a major cause of pain and disability. Identified as a chronic and progressive disease, effective treatment at the early stages of OA has become critical to its management. Jintiange (Jtg) capsules are a traditional Chinese medicine produced from multiple organic components of various animal bones and routinely used to treat osteoporosis in China. However, the effect of Jtg on subchondral bone and cartilage degeneration in OA remains unknown. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the biomolecular role and underlying mechanisms of Jtg in OA progression. Herein, we found that Jtg inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) induced osteoclast formation and it functions through the NF kappa B signaling pathway. Jtg also inhibited chondrocyte apoptosis via reducing the reactive oxygen species concentration in these cells. Moreover, in vivo evaluation revealed that Jtg significantly attenuates subchondral bone remodeling and cartilage destruction in anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) mouse models. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Jtg inhibits osteoclast differentiation in subchondral bone and chondrocyte apoptosis in cartilage, supporting its potential therapeutic value for treating OA.

TI The Waning of Teriparatide Effect on Bone Formation Markers in
   Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Is Associated with Increasing Serum Levels
   of DKK1

LA English
DT Article

   GENE; MASS; SUPPRESSION; SCLEROSTIN; MECHANISMS
AB Context: The effect of teriparatide (TPD) on bone turnover is initially exuberant but then diminishes. TPD is thought to stimulate bone formation by down regulating the expression of specific Wnt antagonists, such as of sclerostin and Dickkopf 1 (DKK1).
   Objective: Our objective was to determine whether long term treatment with TPD is associated with increasing serum levels of either sclerostin or DKK1.
   Design and Setting: Ancillary observation was made of patients participating in a randomized clinical trial.
   Patients, Intervention, and Outcomes: Fifty five women with postmenopausal osteoporosis were randomly allocated to treatment for 18 months with either TPD 20 mu g daily or placebo.
   Results: In the TPD group, both N propeptide of type I collagen and C terminal telopeptide of type I collagen rose significantly by 108 and 175% within the first 6 months. At month 18, the mean values decreased significantly compared with month 12 ( 10 and  12%, respectively), but they were still significantly higher than baseline (+84 and 152%, respectively). Sclerostin remained stable over the entire study period in both groups. DKK1 did not change during the first 6 month of treatment, but only in the active group, it rose significantly at month 12 (median change +26.9%) and remained elevated at month 18 (+29.7%), at the time when the pharmacological effect of treatment with TPD appeared to be declining.
   Conclusion: Long term (> 12 months) treatment with TPD is associated with an increase in serum levels of DKK1 that might be associated with the appearance of declining effect on bone formation markers. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 96: 1555 1559, 2011)

AB Strontium ranelate is a newly approved drug that can reduce the risk of vertebral fracture, which is attributed to its dual function in increasing the bone formation and decreasing the bone resorption. Strontium containing hydroxyapatite was also demonstrated to stimulate the osteoblast activity and inhibit the osteoclast activity. However, the molecular mechanisms of strontium underlying such beneficial effects were still not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of strontium on the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and its related mechanism; its osteogenic potential was also evaluated using a calvarial defect model in rats. We found that strontium could enhance the osteogenic differentiation of the MSCs, with upregulated extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression and activated Wnt/beta catenin pathway. After transplanting the collagen strontium substituted hydroxyapatite scaffold into the bone defect region, histology and computed tomography scanning revealed that in vivo bone formation was significantly enhanced; the quantity of mature and remodeled bone substantially increased and ECM accumulated. Interestingly, strontium induced an increase of beta catenin expression in newly formed bone area. In this study, we showed for the first time that strontium could stimulate the beta catenin expression in vitro and in vivo, which might contribute to the enhanced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and in vivo bone formation.

AB Osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from common mesenchymal progenitor cells. The bone loss of osteoporosis is associated with altered progenitor differentiation from an osteoblastic to an adipocytic lineage. cDNA microarrays and quantitative real time PCR (Q PCR) were carried out in a differentiating mouse stromal osteoblastic cell line, Kusa 4b10, to identify gene targets of factors that stimulate osteoblast differentiation including parathyroid hormone (PTH) and gp130 binding cytokines, oncostatin M (OSM) and cardiotrophin 1 (CT 1). Zinc finger protein 467 (Zfp467) was rapidly down regulated by PTH, OSM, and CT 1. Retroviral overexpression and RNA interference for Zfp467 in mouse stromal cells showed that this factor stimulated adipocyte formation and inhibited osteoblast commitment compared with controls. Regulation of adipocyte markers, including peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) gamma, C/EBP alpha, adiponectin, and resistin, and late osteoblast/osteocyte markers (osteocalcin and sclerostin) by Zfp467 was confirmed by Q PCR. Intra tibial injection of calvarial cells transduced with retroviral Zfp467 doubled the number of marrow adipocytes in C57Bl/6 mice compared with vector control transduced cells, providing in vivo confirmation of a pro adipogenic role of Zfp467. Furthermore, Zfp467 transactivated a PPAR response element reporter construct and recruited a histone deacetylase complex. Thus Zfp467 is a novel co factor that promotes adipocyte differentiation and suppresses osteoblast differentiation. This has relevance to therapeutic interventions in osteoporosis, including PTH based therapies currently available, and may be of relevance for the use of adipose derived stem cells for tissue engineering.

AB Mature osteoclasts degrade bone matrix by exocytosis of active proteases from secretory lysosomes through a ruffled border. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying lysosomal trafficking and secretion in osteoclasts remain largely unknown. Here, we show with GeneChip analysis that RUN and FYVE domain containing protein 4 (RUFY4) is strongly upregulated during osteoclastogenesis. Mice lacking Rufy4 exhibited a high trabecular bone mass phenotype with abnormalities in osteoclast function in vivo. Furthermore, deleting Rufy4 did not affect osteoclast differentiation, but inhibited bone resorbing activity due to disruption in the acidic maturation of secondary lysosomes, their trafficking to the membrane, and their secretion of cathepsin K into the extracellular space. Mechanistically, RUFY4 promotes late endosome lysosome fusion by acting as an adaptor protein between Rab7 on late endosomes and LAMP2 on primary lysosomes. Consequently, Rufy4 deficient mice were highly protected from lipopolysaccharide  and ovariectomy induced bone loss. Thus, RUFY4 plays as a new regulator in osteoclast activity by mediating endo lysosomal trafficking and have a potential to be specific target for therapies against bone loss diseases such as osteoporosis.

AB Higher levels of Dickkopf 1, which is an inhibitor of Wnt/beta catenin bone metabolic pathway, could be indicative of downregulated Wnt system, with possible lower osteoblast activation and higher osteoclast signaling in type 1 diabetes mellitus children and adolescents. Dickkopf 1 could significantly contribute to diabetes osteopathy.
   Increased fracture risk and elevated Dickkopf 1 levels, which is an inhibitor of Wnt/beta catenin bone metabolic pathway, have been documented in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), while no relevant data exist on childhood type 1 diabetes (T1D). Our aim was to study plasma Dickkopf 1 distribution in children and adolescents with T1D and to correlate Dickkopf 1 with metabolic bone markers and bone mineral density (BMD).
   We evaluated 40 children and adolescents with T1D (mean +/  SD age 13.04 +/  3.53 years, T1D duration 5.15 +/  3.33 years) and 40 healthy age matched and gender matched controls (age 12.99 +/  3.3 years). Dickkopf 1 and bone metabolic markers were measured, while total body and lumbar spine BMD were evaluated with dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA).
   Dickkopf 1 demonstrated a Gaussian distribution, with higher levels in T1D patients (13.56 +/  5.34 vs 11.35 +/  3.76 pmol/L, p = 0.024). Higher values were found in boys and in prepubertal children. Dickkopf 1 correlated positively with osteoprotegerin and fasting glucose in patients, while positive correlation with sclerostin and total soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (s RANKL) was found in controls. Positive correlations with C telopeptide cross links (CTX), osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, phosphate, and insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF1) were documented in both groups. Lumbar spine Z score was positively associated with Dickkopf 1 in controls, while a negative trend was found in patients.
   Higher levels of Dickkopf 1 could indicate a downregulated Wnt/beta catenin system with possible lower osteoblast activation and higher osteoclast signaling in T1D children and adolescents. Dickkopf 1 could possibly be a significant contributor of T1D osteopathy. Future therapies could focus on Wnt/beta catenin metabolic pathway.

AB Multiple myeloma is a tumour with a remarkably destructive effect on its host organ, the bone marrow. Through expression or secretion of adhesion molecules, growth factors, exosomes, miRNAs, chemokines and inhibitors, the tumour substantially alters its microenvironment, promoting both tumour survival and osteolytic bone disease. This altered niche is ideally suited to the sustenance of its proliferating compartment and the protection and immune evasion of its dormant, drug resistant fraction. The possibility of deepening response to a drug treatment regime, maintaining remission or even eradicating resistant stem cells by pharmacologically manipulating the tumour's interactions with this niche is a major driving force in current myeloma research. Examples of promising therapies include CXCR4 antagonists, RANKL inhibitors, HIF1 alpha pathway inhibitors, and inhibitors of Notch, Wnt and TGF beta family pathways.

TI Orcinol glucoside targeted p38 as an agonist to promote osteogenesis and

AB Background: Glucocorticoids (GC) induced osteoporosis (GIOP) is the most common cause of secondary osteoporosis, which leads to an increased risk of fracture in patients. The inhibition of the osteoblast effect is one of the main pathological characteristics of GIOP, but without effective drugs on treatment.
   Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential effects of orcinol glucoside (OG) on osteoblast cells and GIOP mice, as well as the mechanism of the underlying molecular target protein of OG both in vitro osteoblast cell and in vivo GIOP mice model.
   Methods: GIOP mice were used to determine the effect of OG on bone density and bone formation. Then, a cellular thermal shift assay coupled with mass spectrometry (CETSA MS) method was used to identify the target of OG. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR), enzyme activity assay, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics were used to detect the affinity, activity, and binding site between OG and its target, respectively. Finally, the anti osteoporosis effect of OG through the target signal pathway was investigated in vitro osteoblast cell and in vivo GIOP mice model.
   Results: OG treatment increased bone mineral density (BMD) in GIOP mice and effectively promoted osteoblast proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and mineralization in vitro. The CETSA MS result showed that the target of OG acting on the osteoblast is the p38 protein. SPR, molecular docking assay and enzyme activity assay showed that OG could direct bind to the p38 protein and is a p38 agonist. The cellular study found that OG could promote p38 phosphorylation and upregulate the proteins expression of its downstream osteogenic (Runx2, Osx, Collagen I, Dlx5). Meanwhile, it could also inhibit the nuclear transport of GR by increasing the phosphorylation site at GR226 in osteoblast cell. In vivo GIOP mice experiment further confirmed that OG could prevent bone loss in the GIOP mice model through promoting p38 activity as well as its downstream proteins expression and activity.
   Conclusions: This study has established that OG could promote osteoblast activity and revise the bone loss in GIOP mice by direct binding to the p38 protein and is a p38 agonist to improve its downstream signaling, which has great potential in GIOP treatment for targeting p38. This is the first report to identify OG anti osteoporosis targets using a label free strategy (CETSA MS).

TI Transcriptomic analysis of mouse cochleae suffering from gentamicin
   damage reveals the signalling pathways involved in hair cell

AB There is a strong capacity for hair cell regeneration after damage in the inner ear of non mammals. However, mammalian hair cells are substantially unable to regenerate. To obtain insights into the mechanism of this difference, we analyzed the transcriptomic changes in the mouse cochleae suffered from gentamicin damage and compared them with those in the chick cochleae suffered from the same damage. The results indicated that 2,230 genes had significantly differential expression between the gentamicin and saline treated mouse cochleae. Some of the differentially expressed genes were grouped into 265 signaling pathways, including the Notch, Wnt (Wingless and INT 1), Bmp (bone morphogenetic protein), FGF (fibroblast growth factor) and Shh (sonic hedgehog) pathways. Using pharmacological inhibitors or agonists of these pathways, the effects of these pathways on hair cell regeneration were further studied. The results indicated that Bmp alone and its coregulation with the Notch or Wnt signaling pathways increased the numbers of generated cells from transdifferentiation or proliferation in the mouse cochlea after damage, in addition to the reported coregulation of Notch and Wnt. Thus, this work indicates a new signaling pathway (Bmp) and its synergetic coregulation in mammalian hair cell regeneration, providing potential therapeutic targets to increase mammalian hair cell regeneration.

AB Multiple myeloma is characterized by the clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells (multiple myeloma cells [MMCs]), in the bone marrow. Osteolytic bone lesions are detected in 80% of patients because of increased osteoclastic bone resorption and reduced osteoblastic bone formation. MMCs are found closely associated with sites of increased bone resorption. Osteoclasts strongly support MMC survival in vitro. To further elucidate the mechanisms involved in osteoclast/MMC interaction, we have identified 552 genes overexpressed in osteoclasts compared with other bone marrow cell subpopulations. Osteoclasts express specifically genes coding for 4 CCR2 targeting chemokines and genes coding for MMC growth factors. An anti CCR2 monoclonal antibody blocked osteoclast chemoattractant activity for MMC, and CCR2 chemokines are also MMC growth factors, promoting mitogen activated protein kinase activation in MMC. An anti insulin growth factor 1 receptor monoclonal antibody completely blocked the osteoclast induced survival of MMC suppressing both osteoclast and MMC survival. Specific a proliferation inducing ligand or IL 6 inhibitors partially blocked osteoclast induced MMC survival. These data may explain why newly diagnosed patients whose MMC express high levels of CCR2 present numerous bone lesions. This study displays additional mechanisms involved in osteoclast/MMC interaction and suggests using CCR2 and/or insulin growth factor 1 targeting strategies to block this interaction and prevent drug resistance.

AB Glucocorticoid (GC) induced longitudinal bone growth retardation is a common and severe adverse effect in pediatric patients receiving GC immunosuppressive therapy. Molecular mechanisms underlying GC induced growth inhibition are unclear. GC withdrawal following short term high dose use is common, including in the immediate post transplant period. However, whether skeleton growth recovery is sufficient or whether growth promoting therapy is required following GC withdrawal is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of exogenous growth hormone (GH) on growth plate impairment in GC induced longitudinal bone growth retardation. Here, apoptotic chondrocytes in the hypertrophic layer of growth plates increased whereas Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) and Parathyroid Hormone Related Peptide (PTHrP) protein levels in the growth plate decreased following GC exposure. The hypertrophic zone of the growth plate expanded following GC withdrawal. Subcutaneously injected GH penetrated the growth plate and modified its organization in rats following GC withdrawal. Ihh and PTHrP expression in GC induced apoptotic chondrocytes decreased in vitro. GH promoted chondrocyte proliferation by activating Ihh/PTHrP signaling. Downregulating Ihh using specific siRNAs increased chondrocyte apoptosis and inhibited PTHrP, Sox9, and type II collagen (Col2a1) protein expression. GH inhibited apoptosis of Ihh deficient growth plate chondrocytes by upregulating PTHrP, Sox9, and Col2a1 expression. Thus, reversal of the effect of GC on growth plate impairment following its withdrawal is insufficient, and exogenous GH provides growth plate chondral protection and improved longitudinal growth following GC withdrawal by acting on the Ihh/PTHrP pathway.

AB Previous reports have shown that osteoblasts are mechano sensitive. Low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) induces osteoblast differentiation and is an established therapy for bone fracture. Here we have examined how LIPUS affects inflammatory responses of osteoblasts to LPS. LPS rapidly induced mRNA expression of several chemokines including CCL2, CXCL1, and CXCL10 in both mouse osteoblast cell line and calvaria derived osteoblasts. Simultaneous treatment by LIPUS significantly inhibited mRNA induction of CXCL1 and CXCL10 by LPS. LPS induced phosphorylation of ERKs, p38 kinases, MEK1/2, MKK3/6, IKKs, TBK1, and Akt was decreased in LIPUS treated osteoblasts. Furthermore, LIPUS inhibited the transcriptional activation of NF kappa B responsive element and Interferon sensitive response element (ISRE) by LPS. In a transient transfection experiment, LIPUS significantly inhibited TLR4 MyD88 complex formation. Thus LIPUS exerts anti inflammatory effects on LPS stimulated osteoblasts by inhibiting TLR4 signal transduction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoparticles that include exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies; they interact with target cell surface receptors and transport contents, including mRNA, proteins, and enzymes into the cytoplasm of target cells to function. The biological fingerprints of EVs practically mirror those of the parental cells they originated from. In the bone remodeling microenvironment, EVs could act on osteoblasts to regulate the bone formation, promote osteoclast differentiation, and regulate bone resorption. Therefore, there have been many attempts wherein EVs were used to achieve targeted therapy in bone related diseases. Periodontitis, a common bacterial infectious disease, could cause severe alveolar bone resorption, resulting in tooth loss, whereas research on periodontal bone regeneration is also an urgent question. Therefore, EVs related studies are important for periodontal bone remodeling. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of mesenchymal stem cell EVs involved in periodontal bone remodeling and explore the functional gene expression through a comparative analysis of transcriptomic content.

AB A single chain Fraction variable (scFv) employs antibody like target recognition specificity. Osteoclasts, responsible for bone resorption, express Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor Kappa B (RANK) receptors. This study aimed to express, characterize, and evaluate scFv against RANK receptors that may serve as a platform to target osteoclasts. Using phage display technology, scFv against RANK receptor was expressed and characterized by DNA sequencing, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE), matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI TOF), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot, and immunocytochemistry. The potential for cytotoxicity was evaluated using an MTT (3[4,5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl] 2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay, and its cross reactivity was evaluated using ELISA. Osteoclast like cells were generated from RAW 264.7 cells, and the osteoclast targeting ability of scFv was evaluated using immunocytochemistry. ScFv's antiresorptive efficacy was studied using a tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) assay and resorption assay. Anti RANK scFv was successfully expressed and characterized. No cross reactivity with other tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) members and no cytotoxic effect on a non RANK bearing cell line were observed. It showed specificity toward a RANK receptor and an inhibitory effect on osteoclast activity. With the increase in development trends for biologics as therapeutics and growing knowledge on the importance of osteoclast targeted therapy, this study may provide a drug delivery strategy to target osteoclasts, thereby leading to a promising therapy for resorptive bone diseases.

TI Protein Palmitoylation Regulates Osteoblast Differentiation through
   BMP Induced Osterix Expression
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Osteoporosis is one of the most common diseases and can be treated by either anti resorption drugs, anabolic drugs, or both. To search for anabolic drug targets for osteoporosis therapy, it is crucial to understand the biology of bone forming cells, osteoblasts, in terms of their proliferation, differentiation, and function. Here we found that protein palmitoylation participates in signaling pathways that control osterix expression and osteoblast differentiation. Mouse calvarial osteoblasts express most of the 24 palmitoyl transferases, with some being up regulated during differentiation. Inhibition of protein palmitoylation, with a substrate analog inhibitor, diminished osteoblast differentiation and mineralization, but not proliferation or survival. The decrease in differentiation capacity is associated with a reduction in osterix, but not Runx2 or Atf4. Inhibition of palmitoyl transferases had little effect in p53( / ) osteoblasts that show accelerated differentiation due to overexpression of osterix, suggesting that osterix, at least partially, mediated the effect of inhibition of palmitoyl transferases on osteoblast differentiation. BMPs are the major driving force of osteoblast differentiation in the differentiation assays. We found that inhibition of palmitoyl transferases also compromised BMP2 induced osteoblast differentiation through down regulating osterix induction. However, palmitoyl transferases inhibitor did not inhibit Smad1/5/8 activation. Instead, it compromised the activation of p38 MAPK, which are known positive regulators of osterix expression and differentiation. These results indicate that protein palmitoylation plays an important role in BMP induced MAPK activation, osterix expression, and osteoblast differentiation.

AB Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in Europe and the United States, and the third leading cause of death from cancer in Europe. Survival of prostate cancer cells is dependent on the activation of androgen receptors (AR), that are overexpressed in this tumor. Furthermore, similar to 90% of prostate cancer patients that respond to first line androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) undergo rapid progression. This condition is defined as castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Docetaxel based regimens significantly improve overall survival (OS) in patients with CRPC and represent the only treatment strategy approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Recently, abiraterone (second hormonal therapy) and cabazitaxel (new taxane) have been shown to improve survival in patients with CRPC who progressed following docetaxel based chemotherapy. Vaccine therapy has also been demonstrated to improve OS in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic CRPC. Additional therapeutic targets have been analyzed in prostate cancer, including apoptosis, angiogenic receptors, vitamin D and Src pathways. Several phase II studies are ongoing. The high frequency of prostate cancer related metastatic bone disease has led to consider this pathway as a therapeutic target. To this end, several bone targeted agents have been investigated, most notably zoledronic acid, which is highly effective at stabilizing the bone and preventing skeletal complications. More recently, a nuclear factor beta ligand (RANKL) inhibitor, denosumab, has been developed for the treatment of bone metastases.

AB Objectives: The purposes of this study were to develop an osteoporosis model in a short period of 2 weeks after ovariectomy in mice and to investigate whether analysis of microcomputed tomography (mu CT) 3 dimensional bone parameters could provide useful information on the mechanism of action of antiosteoporotic agents.
   Materials and Methods: Mice were ovariectomized (OVX) or sham operated, and the OVX mice were treated daily with 17 beta estradiol (EA parathyroid hormone (PTH[1 34]), raloxifene, rolipram, or vehicle for 2 weeks. On day 14 post OVX, the left femur bones were removed and then the distal metaphyseal bone was analyzed by both ACT and histomorphometry.
   Results: The trabecular bone volume, thickness, number, and connectivity significantly decreased and the number of osteoclasts increased in OVX mice. Treatment of OVX animals with each of the 4 antiosteoporotic agents significantly increased the bone volume and improved the bone architecture. However, the improvement of trabecular thickness in the rolipram treated group and that of cortical thickness in the PTH(1 34) treated group were the most marked, whereas the improvement of connectivity in the rolipram treated group was the least among the drug treated groups. These different improving effects of agents on the bone parameters reflect the differential effects of these agents on bone formation and bone resorption.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of evaluating the effect of the antiosteoporotic agents within 2 weeks after ovariectomy in mice. The mu CT analysis may serve as a valuable tool, specifically in a high throughput pharmacological screening test, offering useful information regarding the effects of test compounds on both bone resorption and formation.

AB PKI gamma knockdown substantially extended the anti apoptotic effects of PTH and beta adrenergic agonists, whereas PKI gamma overexpression decreased these effects. Therefore, inhibition of PKI gamma activity may provide a useful co therapy in combination with intermittent PTH or beta adrenergic agonists for bone loss in conditions such as osteoporosis.
   Introduction: PTH has both catabolic and anabolic effects on bone, which are primarily caused by cAMP/ protein kinase A (PKA) signaling and regulation of gene expression. We previously showed that protein kinase inhibitor gamma (PKI gamma) is required for efficient termination of cAMP/PKA signaling and gene expression after stimulation with PTH or P adrenergic agonists. Inhibition of osteoblast apoptosis is thought to be an important, but transient, mechanism partly responsible for the anabolic effects of intermittent PTH. Therefore, we hypothesized that endogenous PKI gamma also terminates the anti apoptotic effect of PTH.
   Materials and Methods: PKI gamma knockdown by antisense transfection or siRNA was used to examine the ability of endogenous PKI gamma to modulate the anti apoptotic effects of PTH and beta adrenergic agonists in ROS 17/2.8 cells.
   Results: Knockdown of PKI gamma substantially extended the anti apoptotic effects of PTH, whether apoptosis was induced by etoposide or dexamethasone. In contrast, overexpression of PKI gamma decreased the anti apoptotic effect of PTH pretreatment. This study is also the first demonstration that beta adrenergic agonists mimic the anti apoptotic effects of PTH in osteoblasts. Moreover, PKI gamma knockdown also substantially extended this anti apoptotic effect of beta adrenergic agonists. Taken together, these results show that endogenous PKI gamma limits the duration of the anti apoptotic effects of cAMP/PKA signaling in osteoblasts.
   Conclusions: Because significant individual variability exists in the anabolic responses to PTH therapy in current clinical treatment of osteoporosis, inhibition of PKI gamma activity may provide a useful co therapy in combination with intermittent PTH or beta adrenergic agonists for bone loss in conditions such as osteoporosis. However, the potential use of such a co therapy would depend on it not adversely affecting bone formation or other organ systems.

AB Pathological formation of bone in non skeletal soft tissues or heterotopic ossification (HO), for which there is currently no effective treatment, is considered to be mediated by activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. Moreover, the biochemical mechanism of this pathological process is not fully understood. Here, we tested the efficacy of three chemical inhibitors of the Hh signaling pathway, arsenic trioxide (ATO), lovastatin (Lov) and cholecalciferol (Vitamin D) to hamper differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) into osteoblasts or osteogenesis. Each of the three Hh inhibitors potently decreased alkaline phosphatase activity, suggesting effective suppression of osteogenic activity in Hh impaired MSC. Gene expression analysis revealed a significant reduction in mRNA levels of chief Hh signaling marker, Gli1, following administration of Hh small molecule inhibitors. A functional link between Hedgehog and osteogenesis in native MSC cells is further established in studies involving the mix of three Hh inhibitors acting at different checkpoints of the Hh signaling pathway. Thus, a combination of small molecule inhibitors of the Hh pathway at their lower concentrations could be a novel approach for HO prophylaxis with increased efficacy and potentially reduced side effects.

AB Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a serious orthopedic problem. Moderate loads with knee loading promote bone formation, but their effects on osteonecrosis have not been investigated. Using a rat model, we examined a hypothesis that knee loading enhances vessel remodeling and bone healing through the modulation of the fate of bone marrow derived cells. In this study, osteonecrosis was induced by transecting the ligamentum teres followed by a tight ligature around the femoral neck. For knee loading, 5 N loads were laterally applied to the knee at 15 Hz for 5 min/day for 5 weeks. Changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) of the femur were measured by pDEXA, and ink infusion was performed to evaluate vessel remodeling. Femoral heads were harvested for histomorphometry, and bone marrow derived cells were isolated to examine osteoclast development and osteoblast differentiation. The results showed that osteonecrosis significantly induced bone loss, and knee loading stimulated both vessel remodeling and bone healing. The osteonecrosis group exhibited the lowest trabecular BV/TV (p < 0.001) in the femoral head, and lowest femoral BMD and BMC (both p < 0.01). However, knee loading increased trabecular BV/TV (p < 0.05) as well as BMD (p < 0.05) and BMC (p < 0.01). Osteonecrosis decreased the vessel volume (p < 0.001), vessel number (p < 0.001) and VEGF expression (p < 0.01), and knee loading increased them (p < 0.001, p < 0.001 and p < 0.01). Osteonecrosis activated osteoclast development, and knee loading reduced its formation, migration, adhesion and the level of "pit" formation (p < 0.001, p < 0.01, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). Furthermore, knee loading significantly increased osteoblast differentiation and CFU F (both p < 0.001). A significantly positive correlation was observed between vessel remodeling and bone healing (both p < 0.01). These results indicate that knee loading could be effective in repair osteonecrosis of the femoral head in a rat model. This effect might be attributed to promoting vessel remodeling, suppressing osteoclast development, and increasing osteoblast and fibroblast differentiation. In summary, the current study suggests that knee loading might potentially be employed as a non invasive therapy for osteonecrosis of the femoral head. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Osteoporosis (OP) is a metabolic bone disease affecting nearly 200 million individuals globally. Morinda officinalis F.C.How (MOH) has long been used as a traditional herbal medicine for the treatment of bone fractures and joint diseases in China. However, it still remains unclear how the compounds in MOH work synergistically for treating OP. In this study, we used prednisolone (PNSL) induced zebrafish OP model to screen the antiosteoporosis components in MOH. A network pharmacology approach was further proposed to explore the underlying mechanism of MOH on OP. The PNSL induced zebrafish model validated that two anthraquinones, one iridoid glycoside, and two saccharides exerted antiosteoporotic effect. We constructed the components targets network and obtained the enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. A total of 26 candidate compounds of MOH and 257 related targets could probably treat OP through regulating osteoclast differentiation and MAPK signaling pathway. Our work developed a strategy to screen the antiosteoporosis components and explore the underlying mechanism of MOH for treating OP at a network pharmacology level.

AB Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can induce bone loss by stimulating bone resorption. Natural compounds have great potential for the treatment of osteolytic bone diseases. Magnesium lithospermate B (MLB) plays an important role in protecting against oxidative damage and also has potential anti inflammatory pharmacological properties. However, its role in LPS induced bone loss is still unknown. In the present study, we observed the effects of MLB on LPS induced bone damage and investigated the possible mechanisms. The bone loss models were established by LPS administration in male Sprague Dawley rats. MLB (200 mg/kg body weight) was given by subcutaneous injection. MicroCT analysis, biomarker assay, histological examination and immunohistochemical staining were performed at the 8th weeks. In addition, RAW264.7 cells were treated with LPS in the presence or absence of MLB. The osteoclast formation, resorption activity and differentiation related genes [(receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK), Traf6, Fra 1, and c src)] expression were evaluated. LPS induced bone loss shown as the decrease in bone volume fraction and trabecular number, and increase in trabecular separation. LPS also markedly enhanced the osteoclast formation and resorption activity compared with the control. MLB significantly abolished the LPS induced bone microstructure damage (p < 0.05) and osteoclast formation. MLB also inhibited the increases of serum tartrate resistant acid phosphatase 5b, RANK ligand (RANKL) and TNF alpha level enhanced by LPS (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining indicated that MLB attenuated the high expression of RANKL and RANK stimulated by LPS. In addition, MLB significantly abolished the LPS enhanced osteoclast formation, resorption activity, RANK, Traf6, Fra 1, and c src expression in vitro. Our data demonstrate that MLB can suppress LPS induced bone loss via inhibiting RANKL/RANK related osteoclast formation.

AB To effectively treat bone diseases using bone regenerative medicine, there is an urgent need to develop safe cheap drugs that can potently induce bone formation. Here, we demonstrate the osteogenic effect of icariin, the main active compound of Epimedium pubescens. Icariin induced osteogenic differentiation in pre osteoblastic MC3T3 E1 cells and mouse primary osteoblasts. Icariin upregulated the mRNA expression levels of the osteoblast marker genes runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (Id 1). The osteogenic effect was inhibited by the introduction of Smad6 or dominant negative Runx2, as well as Noggin treatment. Furthermore, icariin induced the mRNA expression of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4. These data suggest that icariin exerts its potent osteogenic effect through induction of Runx2 expression, production of BMP 4 and activation of BMP signaling. The extremely low cost of icariin and its high abundance make it appealing for bone regenerative medicine. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The biostimulatory effects of laser irradiation focus not only in the field of soft tissue but also bone formation. Studies have shown that the light of a nanosecond pulsed laser which has a high peak power can produce stress waves in tissue. We have hypothesized that nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation stimulates bone formation. Our aim was to clarify the mechanism of increased bone volume by nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation. Rat femur was irradiated with a Q switched Nd:YAG laser, which has a wavelength of 1064 nm. The quantification of trabecular architecture using three dimensional morphometric analysis and measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) using pQCT was performed on day 1, day 3, day 5, and day 7 after laser irradiation. The laser effects on bone cells were also investigated using histological and immunohistochemical analysis. On day I after laser irradiation, bone volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and other parameters of the irradiated group did not significantly differ from the non irradiation group (control). However, the mean BV/TV, Tb.Th, mineral apposition rate, and BMD of the laser group on day 7 after laser irradiation were significantly greater than those of the control. On histological analysis, the number of TRAP positive osteoclasts was lower on day 3 after laser irradiation. Osteoblasts with activated clearance were seen in the laser irradiated group on day I and day 3. These data reveal that the increased bone volume by nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation causes an increase in osteoblast activity and a decrease in osteoclast number. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Background: bone tissue regeneration remains a current challenge. A growing body of evidence shows that mitochondrial dysfunction impairs osteogenesis and that this organelle may be the target for new therapeutic options. Current literature illustrates that red and near infrared light can affect the key cellular pathways of all life forms through interactions with photoacceptors within the cells' mitochondria. The current study aims to provide an understanding of the mechanisms by which photobiomodulation (PBM) by 900 nm wavelengths can induce in vitro molecular changes in pre osteoblasts. Methods: The PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Scholar databases were used. The manuscripts included in the narrative review were selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The new experimental set up was based on irradiation with a 980 nm laser and a hand piece with a standard Gaussian and flat top beam profile. MC3T3 E1 pre osteoblasts were irradiated at 0.75, 0.45, and 0.20 W in continuous wave emission mode for 60 s (spot size 1 cm(2)) and allowed to generate a power density of 0.75, 0.45, and 0.20 W/cm(2) and a fluence of 45, 27, and 12 J/cm(2), respectively. The frequency of irradiation was once, three times (alternate days), or five times (every day) per week for two consecutive weeks. Differentiation, proliferation, and cell viability and their markers were investigated by immunoblotting, immunolabelling, fluorescein FragELTM DNA, Hoechst staining, and metabolic activity assays. Results and conclusions: The 980 nm wavelength can photobiomodulate the pre osteoblasts, regulating their metabolic schedule. The cellular signal activated by 45 J/cm(2), 0.75 W and 0.75 W/cm(2) consist of the PI3K/Akt/Bcl 2 pathway; differentiation markers were not affected, nor do other parameters seem to stimulate the cells. Our previous and present data consistently support the window effect of 980 nm, which has also been described in extracted mitochondria, through activation of signalling PI3K/Akt/Bcl 2 and cyclin family, while the Wnt and Smads 2/3 beta catenin pathway was induced by 55 J/cm(2), 0.9 W and 0.9 W/cm(2).

AB Honokiol, a neolignan, is a physiologically active component of kouboku (Magnolia obovata), a herb used in traditional Chinese medicine. This study investigated the effects of honokiol on the differentiation and function of osteoclasts induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL). Honokiol markedly inhibited RANKL induced tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity and the formation of TRAP positive multi nucleated cells in both bone marrow derived monocytes and RAW264 cells. In experiments to elucidate its mechanism of action, honokiol was found to suppress RANKL induced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), and c Jun N terminal kinase (JNK). The RANKL induced expressions of c Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), which are crucial transcriptional factors for osteoclastogenesis, were also reduced by treatment with honokiol. Furthermore, honokiol induced disruption of the actin rings in mature osteoclasts (mOCs) without affecting the cell viability and suppressed osteoclastic pit formation on dentin slices. Taken together, these results suggest that honokiol inhibits osteoclast differentiation by suppressing the activation of MAPKs (p38 MAPK, ERK and JNK), decreasing the expressions of c Fos and NFATc1 and attenuates bone resorption by disrupting the actin rings in mOCs. Therefore.. honokiol could prove useful for the treatment of bone diseases associated with excessive bone resorption.

AB Backgrounds Myeloma related bone disease (MBD) is a common complication of multiple myeloma (MM), which can both decrease life quality and influence the prognosis of the patients. We have found that CCN1 stimulated proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts in MM in vitro and in vivo, while its mechanism still remains unknown. Method Bone marrow mononuclear cells were collected from MM patients and differentiated into the osteoblasts. After co culture with CCN1 in vitro, the intracellular signaling antibody array and western blot were performed to explore the signaling pathway. Furthermore, GSK3 beta inhibitor TWS119 was used to check the pathway of CCN1 might have on osteoblasts in vitro. Results For the protein array kit, the expressions of GSK3 beta, 4E BP1, and PTEN are decreased in CCN1 group. For western blots, the CCN1 group also has lower expression comparing to the control group in PTEN (P = .031). Meanwhile p AKT and cyclinD1 levels have increased in the CCN1 group (P = .002, P = .039). After adding TWS119 as another group, western blot was performed again to verify the pathway. For upstream proteins PTEN and p AKT, TWS119 group has higher expression level compared to that in CCN1 group (P = .003, P = .001). And for downstream protein cyclinD1, TWS119 group also presented higher level than the control group (P = .02). CCN1 could have almost the same effect on GSK3 beta as the specific inhibitor TWS119 had. Conclusions CCN1 can stimulate osteoblasts through PTEN/AKT/GSK3 beta/cyclinD1 pathway in MBD, which has the potential to be a novel therapy of MBD.

AB Bone homeostasis is maintained by concerted actions of bone forming osteoblasts and bone resorbing osteoclasts. A wide range of evidence indicates that a proinflammatory cytokine IL 17 promotes osteoclastogenesis. However, the role of IL 17 in osteoblasts is less well understood. In the current study, the effect of IL 17 on osteogenic differentiation was investigated in mouse calvarial cells. IL 17 stimulated osteoblast differentiation, mineralization, proliferation, motility, and osteoblast dependent osteoclastogenesis in vitro. The pro osteogenic role of IL 17 was dependent on Act1 and the generation of reactive oxygen species. In a critical size calvarial defect model, IL 17 significantly augmented bone regeneration. Importantly, IL 17 also remarkably increased bone remodeling and restored osteoclastogenesis in zoledronate treated mice. Furthermore, IL 17 conspicuously stimulated the formation of lamellar bones. These data not only provide a clue to understand the role of IL 17 in bone metabolism but also suggest possible applications in bone augmentation therapies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB Stem cells, by definition, are the primitive cells that have the potential of both self renewal and differentiation into a number of mature and functional cells, and thus they have great applications in cell therapy and tissue engineering for regenerative medicine. Bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6) belongs to transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) superfamily. The fate determinations of stem cells require complex regulatory networks that involve BMP6 signaling pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated that BMP6 plays crucial roles in controlling the self renewal and differentiation of stem cells. In this review, we address the expression, function and regulation of BMP6 in various kinds of stem cells, with focus on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), germline stem cells (GSCs), hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and neural stem cells (NSCs). Notably, there are distinct effects of BMP6 on promoting self renewal and differentiation of these stem cells. We also discuss the involement of BMP6 in diseases, including leukemia, astrocytic glioma, and Alzheimer's disease, and the therapy of these diseases via gene targeting. We further highlight certain issues for further investigation on the regulation and function of BMP6 in stem cells. Significantly, a thorough understanding of BMP6 regulation on a variety of adult stem cells could make them feasible for applications in both regenerative and reproductive medicine, and it would shed novel insights into the etiology of the diseases and offer new targets for drug design to treat these disorders.

TI Identification of secondary targets of N containing bisphosphonates in
   mammalian cells via parallel competition analysis of the barcoded yeast
   deletion collection

DT Article

AB Background: Nitrogen containing bisphosphonates are the elected drugs for the treatment of diseases in which excessive bone resorption occurs, for example, osteoporosis and cancer induced bone diseases. The only known target of nitrogen containing bisphosphonates is farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, which ensures prenylation of prosurvival proteins, such as Ras. However, it is likely that the action of nitrogen containing bisphosphonates involves additional unknown mechanisms. To identify novel targets of nitrogen containing bisphosphonates, we used a genome wide high throughput screening in which 5,936 Saccharomyces cerevisiae heterozygote barcoded mutants were grown competitively in the presence of sub lethal doses of three nitrogen containing bisphosphonates (risedronate, alendronate and ibandronate). Strains carrying deletions in genes encoding potential drug targets show a variation of the intensity of their corresponding barcodes on the hybridization array over the time.
   Results: With this approach, we identified novel targets of nitrogen containing bisphosphonates, such as tubulin cofactor B and ASK/DBF4 (Activator of S phase kinase). The up regulation of tubulin cofactor B may explain some previously unknown effects of nitrogen containing bisphosphonates on microtubule dynamics and organization. As nitrogen containing bisphosphonates induce extensive DNA damage, we also document the role of DBF4 as a key player in nitrogen containing bisphosphonate induced cytotoxicity, thus explaining the effects on the cell cycle.
   Conclusions: The dataset obtained from the yeast screen was validated in a mammalian system, allowing the discovery of new biological processes involved in the cellular response to nitrogen containing bisphosphonates and opening up opportunities for development of new anticancer drugs.

AB Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a relatively common chronic inflammatory joint disorder, with a prevalence of about 02 0.5% worldwide. The primary target of the pathological process is the enthesis, where tendons and ligaments attach to underlying bone. These insertion sites are hotspots of bone formation (enthesophytes), which can lead to ankylosis. Unfortunately, the mechanisms causing the onset and progression of entheseal ossification remain largely unknown. Sphingosine 1 phosphate (SIP), a lipid generated after sphingosine phosphorylation by sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 (SK1/2), plays important roles in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. SIP regulates fundamental biological processes such as cell cycle, inflammatory response or bone homeostasis. Indeed, SIP has been involved in some of most spread skeletal diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. On the other hand, the implication of SIP in SpA has not been explored yet. In the present work, we observed by ELISA that SIP content was significantly increased in the serum of SpA patients (6.1 +/  4.2 mu M, n = 21) compared to healthy donors (1.6 +/  0.9 mu M, n = 12). In vitro, gene expression of SK1 and SK2 as well as their activity were increased during differentiation of primary murine chondrocytes and osteoblasts into mineralizing cells. In addition, mRNA of the S1P specific transporter Spns2 and SIP secretion were augmented. Using the pharmacological drugs SKi (SK pan inhibitor), PF 543 (SK1 specific inhibitor) or K 145 (SK2 specific inhibitor), we showed that the inhibition of SK1 and/or SK2 decreased matrix mineralization, alkaline phosphatase activity and the mRNA expression of Runx2 and Bglap in chondrocytes and osteoblasts. To our knowledge, this is the first study indicating that SIP levels are significantly increased in serum from SpA patients. Moreover, we showed in vitro that SK activity was involved in the mineralization capacity of osteoblasts and chondrocytes. SIP metabolic pathway may represent an ingenious therapeutic target for SpA in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), an osteopromotive neurotransmitter with a short half life, shows increase while calcitonin receptor like (CALCRL) level is decreased at the early stage in bone fractures. Therefore, the activation of CALCRL mediated signaling may be more critical to promote the tendon bone healing. We found CGRP enhanced osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs through PKA/CREB/JUNB pathway, contributing to improved sonic hedgehog (SHH) expression, which was verified at the tendon bone interface (TBI) in the mice with Calcrl overexpression. The osteoblast derived SHH and slit guidance ligand 3 were reported to favor nerve regeneration and type H (CD31(hi)EMCN(hi)) vessel formation, respectively. Encouragingly, the activation or inactivation of CALCRL mediated signaling significantly increased or decreased intensity of type H vessel and nerve fiber at the TBI, respectively. Simultaneously, improved gait characteristics and biomechanical performance were observed in the Calcrl overexpression group. Together, the gene therapy targeting CGRP receptor may be a therapeutic strategy in sports medicine.

AB Destructive bone diseases caused by osteolysis are increasing in incidence. They are characterized by an excessive imbalance of osteoclast formation and activation. During osteolysis, the activation of nuclear factor B (NF B) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways are triggered by receptor activatorof NF B ligand (RANKL), inflammatory factors, and oxidative stress. Previous studies have indicated that the common flavanone glycoside compound hesperetin exhibits anti inflammatory and antioxidant activity by inhibition of NF B and MAPK signaling pathways. However, the direct relationship between hesperetin and osteolysis remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of hesperetin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced osteoporosis and elucidated the related mechanisms. Hesperetin effectively suppressed RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis, osteoclastic bone resorption, and F actin ring formation in a dose dependent manner. It also significantly suppressed the expression of osteoclast specific markers including tartrate resistant acid phosphatase, matrix metalloproteinase 9, cathepsin K, c Fos, and nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1. Furthermore, it inhibited osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting activation of NF B and MAPK signaling, scavenging reactive oxygen species, and activating the nuclear factor E2 p45 related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1 (Nrf2/HO 1) signaling pathway. Consistent with in vitro results, hesperetin effectively ameliorated LPS induced bone loss, reduced osteoclast numbers, and decreased the RANKL/OPG ratio in vivo. As such, our results suggest that hesperetin may be a great candidate for developing a novel drug for destructive bone diseases such as periodontal disease, tumor bone metastasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis.

AB Background Fuzi decoction (FZD), a traditional Chinese medicine formula, was used to treat musculoskeletal diseases by warming channels, strengthening yang and dispelling pathogenic cold and dampness. In clinical practice, FZD has been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. It alleviated osteoarticular disorders through ameliorating the degradation of cartilage and improving meniscal damage in osteoarthritis, while its roles and mechanisms in the treatment of bone loss diseases remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the underlying mechanisms of FZD in treating osteoporosis using an integrative method of network pharmacology and experimental study.Methods In this study, network pharmacology was used to predict the core targets and potential pathways of the bioactive ingredients of FZD to attenuate osteoporosis. Molecular docking was performed to evaluate the interactions between core compounds and key targets. In addition, both cell and animal experiments were carried out to validate the role and potential mechanism in treating osteoporosis.Results In the present study, data revealed that kaempferol, beta sitosterol, stigmasterol, fumarine, and (+) catechin may be the primary bioactive ingredients of FZD in the treatment of osteoporosis, which were closely associated with the osteoporosis related targets. And the KEGG results indicated that the NF ?B pathway was closely associated with the function of FZD in treating osteoporosis. In addition, in vivo demonstrated that FZD ameliorated osteoporosis. In vitro experiments showed that the pro apoptotic factors indicators including CASP3 and BAX were decreased by FZD and the anti apoptotic factor BCL2 was increased by FZD. In addition, FZD significantly suppressed the osteoclast differentiation in culture and the expression levels of osteoclast related genes including TRAF6, CTSK, and MMP9. And the NF ?B pathway was confirmed, via in vitro experiment, to be involved in osteoclast differentiation.Conclusions This study demonstrated that FZD played a pivotal role in suppressing the osteoclast differentiation via regulating the NF ?B pathway, indicating that FZD could be a promising antiosteoporosis drug and deserve further investigation.

TI Spi C positively regulates RANKL mediated osteoclast differentiation and
   function

AB Spi C is an SPI group erythroblast transformation specific domain transcription factor expressed during B cell development. Here, we report that Spi C is a novel receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) inducible protein that positively regulates RANKL mediated osteoclast differentiation and function. Knockdown of Spi C decreased the expression of RANKL induced nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK), and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), resulting in a marked decrease in the number of TRAP positive multinucleated cells. Spi C transduced bone marrow derived monocytes/macrophages (BMMs) displayed a significant increase in osteoclast formation in the presence of RANKL. In addition, Spi C depleted cells failed to show actin ring formation or bone resorption owing to a marked reduction in the expression of RANKL mediated dendritic cell specific transmembrane protein and the d2 isoform of vacuolar (H+) ATPase V0 domain, which are known osteoclast fusion related genes. Interestingly, RANKL stimulation induced the translocation of Spi C from the cytoplasm into the nucleus during osteoclastogenesis, which was specifically blocked by inhibitors of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) or PI3 kinase. Moreover, Spi C depletion prevented RANKL induced MAPK activation and the degradation of inhibitor of kappa B alpha (I kappa B alpha) in BMMs. Collectively, these results suggest that Spi C is a novel positive regulator that promotes both osteoclast differentiation and function.
   Bone maintenance: regulating cells that break down bone A gene controlling protein called Spi C promotes the development of bone processing cells called osteoclasts; details of the molecular mechanisms involved will aid understanding of Spi C's role in bone health and disease. Osteoclasts degrade bone during the normal process of bone remodeling, balanced by the activity of osteoblast cells that form new bone. Excessive osteoclast activity can cause the bone loss associated with various bone diseases including early onset osteoporosis. Researchers in South Korea led by Soo Young Lee at Ewha Womans University and Na Kyung Lee at Soonchunhyang University, Asan, found that Spi C promotes osteoclast development by activating genes that code for key proteins of a signaling pathway known to be crucial for bone health. Drugs that interfere with Spi C activity may therefore offer a new approach for treating bone disease.

AB Osteoclasts are bone resorbing cells that are important for maintenance of bone remodeling and mineral homeostasis. Regulation of osteoclast differentiation and activity is important for the pathogenesis and treatment of diseases associated with bone loss. Here, we demonstrate that retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are key elements of the transcriptional program of differentiating osteoclasts. Loss of RXR function in hematopoietic cells resulted in formation of giant, nonresorbing osteoclasts and increased bone mass in male mice and protected female mice from bone loss following ovariectomy, which induces osteoporosis in WT females. The increase in bone mass associated with RXR deficiency was due to lack of expression of the RXR dependent transcription factor v maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene family, protein B (MAFB) in osteoclast progenitors. Evaluation of osteoclast progenitor cells revealed that RXR homodimers directly target and bind to the Mafb promoter, and this interaction is required for proper osteoclast proliferation, differentiation, and activity. Pharmacological activation of RXRs inhibited osteoclast differentiation due to the formation of RXR/liver X receptor (LXR) heterodimers, which induced expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP 1c), resulting in indirect MAFB upregulation. Our study reveals that RXR signaling mediates bone homeostasis and suggests that RXRs have potential as targets for the treatment of bone pathologies such as osteoporosis.

AB There are three distinct areas of cancer management that make bone health in cancer patients of increasing clinical importance. First, bone metastases are common in many solid tumours, notably those arising from the breast, prostate and lung, as well as multiple myeloma, and may cause major morbidity including fractures, severe pain, nerve compression and hypercalcaemia. Through optimum multidisciplinary management of patients with bone metastases, including the use of bone targeted treatments such as potent bisphosphonates or denosumab, it has been possible to transform the course of advanced cancer for many patients resulting in a major reduction in skeletal complications, reduced bone pain and improved quality of life. Secondly, many of the treatments we use to treat cancer patients have effects on reproductive hormones, which are critical for the maintenance of normal bone remodelling. This endocrine disturbance results in accelerated bone loss and an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures that can have a significant negative impact on the lives of the rapidly expanding number of long term cancer survivors. Finally, the bone marrow micro environment is also intimately involved in the metastatic processes required for cancer dissemination, and there are emerging data showing that, at least in some clinical situations, the use of bone targeted treatments can reduce metastasis to bone and has potential impact on patient survival.

AB BackgroundTo provide a low toxicity and high efficacy clinical treatment for osteoporosis via a novel combination of LiCl and LY294002.MethodsThe protein levels of p AKT, AKT, p GSK3, GSK3,  catenin, p  catenin, and NFATC1 were measured in osteoblasts and osteoclasts by Western blot. ALP activity and TRACP activity were measured using the corresponding kit. The levels of BALP, PINP, CTX, and TRACP 5b were determined in accordance with the requirements of the ELISA kits. Microstructural analysis was performed on the left distal femur using microcomputed tomography.ResultsTreatment with the combination of LiCl and LY294002 led to a markedly increased osteoblast activity but significantly decreased osteoclast differentiation and bone absorption capacity compared with the treatment with LiCl or LY294002 alone (P<0.01). In serum, the low dose combination of LiCl and LY294002 significantly enhanced BALP levels (P<0.01) and significantly decreased PINP, TRACP 5b, and CTX levels (P<0.01) compared with the application of either drug alone.ConclusionsThis study indicates that drug combinations directed at multiple targets could be used for osteoporosis treatment by promoting osteoblast proliferation and inhibiting differentiation with high efficiency.

AB Bone homeostasis is regulated by a balance between osteoclast (OCL) mediated bone resorption and osteoblast (OBL) mediated bone formation. Thus, developing a compound that simultaneously inhibits OCL function and promotes OBL function would be useful as a new medical therapy for bone diseases. Here, we examined the effects of cafestol, a coffee diterpene, on the differentiation of OCLs and OBLs. Cafestol prevented OCL formation in a dose dependent manner and suppressed the bone resorbing activity of OCLs. Interestingly, the viability of OCLs treated with 10 50 mu M cafestol was significantly higher than that of untreated cells. At the molecular level, cafestol markedly decreased RANKL induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (Erk) and inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B alpha (IB). Compared to kahweol, another coffee specific diterpene, the inhibitory effects of cafestol were milder on OCL differentiation, and cafestol and kahweol showed different characteristics in induction of the phase antioxidant enzymes and sensitivities in nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) deficient BMMs. In addition to inhibiting OCLs, cafestol enhanced the differentiation of osteoblastic cells by increasing the mRNA levels of differentiation markers. Thus, cafestol inhibits OCL differentiation and promotes OBL differentiation, suggesting that cafestol may be a novel agent for bone diseases. (c) 2015 BioFactors, 41(4):222 231, 2015

AB Periodontitis is the main cause of adult tooth loss. Stem cell based tissue engineering has become a promising therapy for periodontitis treatment. To date, human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) have been shown to be a favorable source for tissue engineering, but modulatory mechanisms of hPDLSCs remain unclear. Approximately 60% of mammalian genes are the targets of over 2000 miRNAs in multiple human cell types, and miRNAs are able to influence various biological processes in the human body, including bone formation. In this study, we found that after osteogenic induction, miR 214 was significantly decreased in hPDLSCs; therefore, we examined the effects of miR 214 on osteogenic differentiation. Computational miRNA target prediction analyses and luciferase reporter assays revealed that activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is a direct target of miR 214. We prepared cells overexpressing miR 214 and found that miR 214 negatively regulates osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs. For the target of miR 214, ATF4 protein expression level was decreased after induction. In conclusion, we found that miR 214 ATF4 axis is a novel pathway for regulating hPDLSC osteogenic differentiation.

AB Eucommia leaves are dry leaves of Eucommia ulmoides which have long been considered as a functional health food for the treatment of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, fatty liver, and osteoporosis. With the recent development of Chinese medicine, Eucommia leaves are widely used for tonifying the kidneys and strengthening bone. However, the specific molecular mechanism of Eucommia leaves for strengthening bone remains largely unknown. Osteoblasts are the main functional cells of bone formation; thus, it is essential to study the effect of Eucommia leaves on osteoblasts to better understand their mechanism of action. In the present study, we prepared an aqueous extract of Eucommia leaves (ELAE) and determined its content by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The effects of ELAE on MC3T3 E1 cells were investigated by CCK 8 assay, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and Alizarin red S staining assays, combined with RNA sequencing (RNA seq) and qRT PCR validation. We demonstrated that ELAE had a significant promoting effect on the proliferation of MC3T3 E1 cells and significantly enhanced extracellular matrix synthesis and mineralization, which were achieved by regulating various functional genes and related signaling pathways. ELAE significantly increased the expression level of genes promoting cell proliferation, such as Rpl10a, Adnp, Pex1, Inpp4a, Frat2, and Pcdhga1, and reduced the expression level of genes inhibiting cell proliferation, such as Npm1, Eif3e, Cbx3, Psmc6, Fgf7, Fxr1, Ddx3x, Mbnl1, and Cdc27. In addition, ELAE increased the expression level of gene markers in osteoblasts, such as Col5a2, Ubap2l, Dkk3, Foxm1, Col16a1, Col12a1, Usp7, Col4a6, Runx2, Sox4, and Bmp4. Taken together, our results suggest that ELAE could promote osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization and prevent osteoblast apoptosis. These findings not only increase our understanding of ELAE on the regulation of bone development but also provide a possible strategy to further study the prevention and treatment of osteogenic related diseases by ELAE.

AB In mammals, including humans, bone metabolism is manifested as an ongoing modelling/remodelling process whereby the bone mineralised matrix is being continuously renewed. Recently, the main components of the endocannabinoid system have been reported in the skeleton. Osteoblasts, the bone forming cells, and other cells of the osteoblastic lineage, as well as osteoclasts, the bone resorbing cells, and their precursors, synthesise the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2 arachidonoylglycerol (2 AG). CB1 cannabinoid receptors are present in sympathetic nerve terminals in close proximity to osteoblasts. Activation of these CB1 receptors by elevated bone 2 AG levels communicates brain to bone signals as exemplified by traumatic brain injury induced stimulation of bone formation. In this process, the retrograde CB1 signalling inhibits noradernaline release and alleviates the tonic sympathetic restrain of bone formation. CB2 receptors are expressed by osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Their activation stimulates bone formation and suppresses bone resorption. CB2 deficient mice display a markedly accelerated age related bone loss. Ovariectomy induced bone loss can be both prevented and rescued by a CB2 specific agonist. Hence, synthetic CB2 ligands, which are stable and orally available, provide a basis for developing novel anti osteoporotic therapies, free of psychotropic effects. The CNR2 gene (encoding CB2) in women is associated with low bone mineral density, offering an assay for identifying females at risk of developing osteoporosis.

AB Background and Objective: Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) has been suggested to improve bone tissue heating. The cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this effect are still unclear but bone cell proliferation and differentiation alteration have been proposed. The aim of the present study was to investigate, in vitro, the effect of LLLT on bone cell proliferation, osteoblastic and osteoclastic differentiation, both involved in bone remodeling and regeneration.
   Study Design/Materials and Methods: Murine bone marrow cells, which contain both osteoblast and osteoclast progenitors, were cultured and induced to differentiate in the absence or in the presence of LLLT. Laser exposition parameters were determined using a powermeter and consisted in an 808 nm infrared wavelength laser light in continuous mode, with an energy density of 4 J/cm(2) administered three times a week. Cell proliferation and differentiation were assessed after specific staining and microscopic analysis of the cultures after various times, as well as by quantitative RT PCR analysis of a panel of osteoblast and. osteoclast markers after nucleic acid extraction.
   Results: The use of a powermeter revealed that the power emitted by the optical fiber of the laser device was markedly reduced compared to the displayed power. This allowed to adjust the LLLT parameters to a final energy density exposure of 4 J/cm(2). In these conditions, proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells as well as osteoclast or osteoblast differentiation of the corresponding progenitors were found similar in control and LLLT conditions.
   Conclusion: Using the present experimental protocol, we concluded that an 808 nm wavelength infrared LLLT does not alter murine bone progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. Moreover our results confirm the necessary use of a powermeter to fix LLLT protocol parameters. Lasers Surg. Med. 41:291 297, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley Liss, Inc.

AB Suppression of differentiation and/or function of osteoclasts is considered an effective therapeutic strategy for osteolytic bone diseases such as periodontitis and osteoporosis. Evidence regarding the health benefits of oolong tea consumption is accumulating, and tea polyphenols have various pharmacological properties such as anticancer and anti diabetes effects. In this study, we investigated the effect of oolonghomobisflavan B (OFB), a polyphenolic compound in oolong tea, on osteoclast differentiation. OFB suppressed receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANKL) induced formation of tartate resistant acid phosphatase positive multinuclear cells without cytotoxicity. OFB also significantly attenuated p38 phosphorylation, which is essential for RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis, and inhibited the expressions of nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) and osteoclast specific target genes, including dendritic cell specific transmembrane protein and cathepsin K. Our findings suggest that OFB exhibits an anti osteoclastogenic activity by inhibiting RANKL mediated p38 activation, which is useful for the prevention and treatment of osteolytic bone diseases.

AB Bone is the most common metastatic site for breast cancer. There is a significant need to understand the molecular mechanisms controlling the engraftment and growth of tumor cells in bone and to discover novel effective therapeutic strategies. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of tivantinib and Zoledronic Acid (ZA) in combination in a breast xenograft model of bone metastases. Cancer cells were intracardially implanted into immunodeficient mice and the effects of drugs alone or in combination on bone metastasis were evaluated by in vivo non invasive optical and micro CT imaging technologies. Drugs were administered either before (preventive regimen) or after (therapeutic regimen) bone metastases were detectable. In the preventive regimen, the combination of tivantinib plus ZA was much more effective than single agents in delaying bone metastatic tumor growth. When administered in the therapeutic schedule, the combination delayed metastatic progression and was effective in improving survival. These effects were not ascribed to a direct cytotoxic effect of the combined therapy on breast cancer cells in vitro. The results of this study provide the rationale for the design of new combinatorial strategies with tivantinib and ZA for the treatment of breast cancer bone metastases.

AB Background: High dose glucocorticoid (GC) therapy always causes osteoporosis partly by inducing osteoblast apoptosis. However, the underlying mechanisms of GC induced apoptosis remain elusive. Haem oxygenase 1 (HO 1) is a cytoprotective protein that rescues cells from H2O2 or high glucose induced apoptosis. In bone metabolism, HO 1 also participates in osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation.
   Objective: The present study aimed to investigate the protective role of HO 1 against GC induced osteoblast apoptosis and to elucidate the underlying mechanism.
   Methods: Mouse osteoblastic MC3T3 E1 cells were treated with dexamethasone (Dex) for 24 h in the presence or absence of cobalt (III) protoporphyrin IX chloride (CoPP, an inducer of HO 1). In some experiments, U0126 was added to the culture 1 h before CoPP treatment. The induction of apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. Cell viability was evaluated using a cell counting kit 8 (CCK 8) assay. The expression levels of Bax and bcl 2 were measured by real time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. HO 1, extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) 1 /2 and pERK1/2 protein levels were measured by Western blot analysis.
   Results: Dex promoted apoptosis and inhibited cell viability in MC3T3 E1 cells. In addition, Dex significantly increased Bax expression and reduced Bcl 2 expression. The expression of HO 1 was also reduced after Dex treatment. HO 1 induction by CoPP significantly attenuated Dex induced apoptosis as evidenced by Annexin V/PI staining. The mRNA expression level of antiapoptotic gene Bcl 2 was also increased after CoPP treatment. Moreover, CoPP treatment increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. U0126, an inhibitor of ERK activation, significantly abrogated the protective effects of CoPP.
   Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that HO 1 induction by CoPP can attenuate Dex induced apoptosis of mouse osteoblastic MC3T3 E1 cells. The antiapoptotic effect of HO 1 induction may be correlated with the activation of ERK1/2 signalling pathway.
   The translational potential of this article: HO 1 induction by CoPP can prevent GC induced osteoblast apoptosis. Our findings will highlight the therapeutic potential of HO 1 induction in GC induced osteoporosis. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Background/Aims: Mechanical loading plays an important role in the regulation of bone mass. However, bone cells are not always under physiological stress. In some cases, bone tissue is subjected to an overloaded mechanical environment. For example, a person who is weight training and a stevedore often experience bone pain, inflammation and other bone fatigue damage symptoms. Icariin is the major ingredient of Herba epimedii, which has been widely used for the treatment of bone injury in traditional Chinese medicine, but its mechanism remains unknown. The aim of this study was to probe the effect of icariin on the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts exposed to overload and to determine whether the Wnt/beta catenin signalling pathway is involved in the drug response in osteoblasts. Methods: Mouse MC3T5 E1 cells were exposed to mechanical tensile strain using a four point bending device to create an overload damage model. An MTT assay was performed to determine the effects of icariin on MC3T3 E1 cell proliferation. The mRNA and protein levels of ALP, COL I, OCN, RUNX2 and beta catenin were assessed using RT PCR and immunoblotting. The protein levels of beta catenin in the MC3T3 E1 cells were also determined using fluorescence microscopy. The mineralization of osteoblasts was assessed using Alizarin Red S staining. Results: We found that icariin enhanced the proliferation of osteoblasts exposed to overload and promoted MC3T3 E1 cell differentiation and mineralization. Furthermore, the gene and protein expression levels of beta catenin and RUNX2 all increased with icariin treatment compared with those in the damage group. Conclusion: Our study suggested that icariin promotes proliferation and differentiation in osteoblasts exposed to overload. The effect of icariin on osteoblastic differentiation acted by activating the RUNX2 promoter and the Wnt/p catenin pathway. (C) 2017 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Background: Many bone related diseases such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis are commonly associated with excessive activity of the osteoclast. Ganomycin I (GMI), a meroterpenoid isolated from Vietnamese mushroom Ganoderma lucidum, possesses a variety of beneficial effects on human health. However, its impact and underlying mechanism on osteoclastogenesis remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of GMI on RANKL induced osteoclast formation in mouse BMMs and RAW264.7 cells.
   Methods: BMMs or RAW264.7 cells were treated with GMI followed by an evaluation of cell viability, RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation, actin ring formation, and resorption pits activity. Effects of GMI on RANKL induced phosphorylation of MAPKs as well as the expression levels of NFATc1 and c Fos were evaluated by Western blot analysis. Expression levels of osteoclast marker genes were evaluated by Western blot analysis and reverse transcription qPCR.
   Results: GMI significantly inhibited RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation by decreasing the number of osteoclasts, osteoclast actin ring formation, and bone resorption in a dose dependent manner without affecting cell viability. At molecular level, GMI inhibited the RANKL induced phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPKs, as well as the expression levels of c Fos and NFATc1, which are known to be crucial transcription factors for osteoclast formation. In addition, GMI decreased expression levels of osteoclastogenesis specific marker genes including c Src, CtsK, TRAP, MMP 9, OSCAR, and DC STAMP in RANKL stimulated BMMs.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that GMI can attenuate osteoclast formation by suppressing RANKL mediated MAPKs and NFATc1 signaling pathways and the anti osteoclastogenic activity of GMI may extend our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying biological activities and pharmacological use of G. lucidum as a traditional anti osteoporotic medicine.

AB Although osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is a serious complication of craniofacial radiotherapy, the current management methods remain suboptimal. Teriparatide (TPTD), a recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1 34), has shown beneficial effects on osseous regeneration in medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw or periodontitis. However, TPTD therapy in irradiated bones has not been indicated yet because of the theoretical risk of osteosarcoma seen in rat models. Hence, we first report here two patients with tongue cancer with late emerging ORN who were successfully treated with TPTD for 4 6 months with serum calcium and vitamin D supplementation. In contrast to the usual progress of ORN, the bone defect regenerated well and bone turnover markers including serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and osteocalcin were restored with TPTD therapy. Our experience might suggest that TPTD therapy with careful monitoring can provide an effective treatment option for patients with ORN in select refractory cases, with the benefits outweighing the potential risks.

AB Objective. Osteoporosis is a growing healthcare burden. By identifying osteoporosis promoting genetic variations, we can spotlight targets for new pharmacologic therapies that will improve patient outcomes. In this metaanalysis, we analyzed mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) biomarkers in patients with osteoporosis.
   Methods. We employed our Search Tag Analyze Resource for the Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO) platform to conduct a rnetaanalysis to define osteoporosis pathogenesis. We compared 15 osteoporotic and 14 healthy control MSC samples. We then analyzed the genetic signature in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.
   Results. The top canonical pathways identified that were statistically significant included the serine peptidase inhibitor kazal type 1 pancreatic cancer pathway, calcium signaling, pancreatic adenocarcinorna signaling, axonal guidance signaling, and glutamate receptor signaling. Upstream regulators involved in this disease process included ESR1, dexamethasone, CTN beta 1, CREB1, and ERBB2.
   Conclusion. Although there has been extensive research looking at the genetic basis for inflammatory arthritis, very little literature currently exists that has identified genetic pathways contributing to osteoporosis. Our study has identified several important genes involved in osteoporosis pathogenesis including ESR1, CTNN beta 1, CREB1, and ERBB2. ESR1 has been shown to have numerous polymorphisms, which may play a prominent role in osteoporosis. The Wnt pathway, which includes the CTNN beta 1 gene identified in our study, plays a prominent role in bone mass regulation. Wnt pathway polymorphisms can increase susceptibility to osteoporosis. Our analysis also suggests a potential mechanism for ERBB2 in osteoporosis through Semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D). Our metaanalysis identifies several genes and pathways that can be targeted to develop new anabolic drugs for osteoporosis treatment.

AB Spondyloarthritis refers to a group of chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases that predominantly affects the axial skeleton, causing pain and stiffness. Human bone is highly dynamic organ that interacts with a wide array cells and tissues. Process of bone remodelling relies on a delicate balance between bone formation and bone resorption, orchestrated by osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Disruption of this homeostatic balance of bone removal and replacement can manifest as inappropriate new bone formation found in spondylarthritis. We hypothesize that VEGF may promote bone remodelling, stimulate angiogenesis, and both osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity. Anti VEGF may be tested as a dedicated therapy to prevent bone remodelling in spondyloarthritis patients, namely in cases of aggressive disease. Bone remodelling could be monitored by using [18F]Fluoride PET scan. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Notch signaling critically controls cell fate decisions in mammals, both during embryogenesis and in adults. In the skeleton, Notch suppresses osteoblast differentiation and sustains bone marrow mesenchymal progenitors during postnatal life. Stabilizing mutations of Notch2 cause Hajdu Cheney syndrome, which is characterized by early onset osteoporosis in humans, but the mechanism whereby Notch inhibits bone accretion is not fully understood. Here, we report that activation of Notch signaling by either Jagged1 or the Notch2 intracellular domain suppresses glucose metabolism and osteoblast differentiation in primary cultures of bone marrow mesenchymal progenitors. Importantly, deletion of Notch2 in the limb mesenchyme increases both glycolysis and bone formation in the long bones of postnatal mice, whereas pharmacological reduction of glycolysis abrogates excessive bone formation. Mechanistically, Notch reduces the expression of glycolytic and mitochondrial complex I genes, resulting in a decrease in mitochondrial respiration, superoxide production, and AMPK activity. Forced activation of AMPK restores glycolysis in the face of Notch signaling. Thus, suppression of glucose metabolism contributes to the mechanism, whereby Notch restricts osteoblastogenesis from bone marrow mesenchymal progenitors.

TI Deletion of Estrogen Receptor Beta in Osteoprogenitor Cells Increases
   Trabecular but Not Cortical Bone Mass in Female Mice

AB Although the role of ER in regulating bone metabolism has been extensively studied, ER has been largely dismissed as a relevant modulator of bone mass. Previous studies examining ER utilized a germline knockout mouse expressing transcript variants of ER and displaying systemic hormonal changes that confounded interpretation of the skeletal phenotype. Thus, we used a conditional ER mouse model to achieve deletion of ER specifically in early osteoprogenitor cells using the Prx1 Cre driver. We observed marked increases in the trabecular bone volume fraction (of 58% [p<0.003] and 93% [p<0.0003] in 6  and 12 week old female ERPrx1 CKO mice, respectively) but no changes in cortical bone. Serum estradiol and IGF I levels were unaltered in ERPrx1 CKO mice. Bone formation and resorption indices by histomorphometry and serum assays were unchanged in these mice, suggesting that alterations in bone turnover may have occurred early in development. However, the ratio of colony forming unit osteoblasts (CFU OBs) to CFU fibroblasts (CFU Fs) was increased in bone marrow cultures from ERPrx1 CKO compared with control mice, indicating increased differentiation of osteoblast precursor cells into osteoblasts in ERPrx1 CKO mice. Detailed quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses of 128 genes in 16 prespecified pathways revealed significant downregulation of 11 pathways in ERPrx1 CKO mice. Thus, deletion of ER specifically in osteoblast lineage cells, in the absence of all splice variants, increases trabecular bone mass and modulates multiple pathways related to bone metabolism. These findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of ER in bone may provide a novel approach to treat osteoporosis. (c) 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are efficacious epigenetic based therapies for some cancers and neurological disorders; however, each of these drugs inhibits multiple HDACs and has detrimental effects on the skeleton. To better understand how HDAC inhibitors affect endochondral bone formation, we conditionally deleted one of their targets, Hdac3, pre  and postnatally in type II collagen alpha 1 (Col2 alpha 1) expressing chondrocytes. Embryonic deletion was lethal, but postnatal deletion of Hdac3 delayed secondary ossification center formation, altered maturation of growth plate chondrocytes, and increased osteoclast activity in the primary spongiosa. HDAC3 deficient chondrocytes exhibited increased expression of cytokine and matrix degrading genes (II 6, Mmp3, Mmp13, and Saa3) and a reduced abundance of genes related to extracellular matrix production, bone development, and ossification (Acan, Col2a1, Ihh, and Col10a1). Histone acetylation increased at and near genes that had increased expression. The acetylation and activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) were also increased in HDAC3  deficient chondrocytes. Increased cytokine signaling promoted autocrine activation of Janus kinase (JAK) signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and NF kappa B pathways to suppress chondrocyte maturation, as well as paracrine activation of osteoclasts and bone resorption. Blockade of interleukin 6 (IL 6) JAK STAT signaling, NF kappa B signaling, and bromodomain extraterminal proteins, which recognize acetylated lysines and promote transcriptional elongation, significantly reduced II 6 and Mmp13 expression in HDAC3 deficient chondrocytes and secondary activation in osteoclasts. The JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib also reduced osteoclast activity in Hdac3 conditional knockout mice. Thus, HDAC3 controls the temporal and spatial expression of tissue remodeling genes and inflammatory responses in chondrocytes to ensure proper endochondral ossification during development.

AB New strategies involving bone targeting titanium (Ti) implant bone interface are required to enhance bone regeneration and osseointegration for orthopedic and dental implants, especially in osteoporotic subjects. In this study, a new dual controlled, local, bone targeting delivery system was successfully constructed by loading tetracycline grafted simvastatin (SV) loaded polymeric micelles in titania nanotube (TNT) arrays, and a bone targeting Ti implant bone interface was also successfully constructed by implanting the delivery system in vivo. The biological effects were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that Ti surfaces with TNT bone targeting micelles could promote cytoskeletal spreading, early adhesion, alkaline phosphatase activity, and extracellular osteocalcin concentrations of rat osteoblasts, with concomitant enhanced protein expression of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2. A single wall bone defect implant model was established in normal and ovariectomized rats as postmenopausal osteoporosis models. Microcomputed tomography imaging and BMP 2 expression in vivo demonstrated that the implant with a TNT targeting micelle surface was able to promote bone regeneration and osseointegration in both animal models. Therefore, beneficial biological effects were demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo, which indicated that the bone targeting effects of micelles greatly enhance the bioavailability of SV on the implant bone interface, and the provision of SV loaded targeting micelles alone exhibits the potential for extensive application in improving local bone regeneration and osseointegration, especially in osteoporotic subjects.

AB Background. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by poor regulation of the immune response leading to chronic inflammation and multiple organ dysfunction. Glucocorticoid (GC) is currently one of the main treatments. However, a high dose or prolonged use of GC may result in glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis (GIOP). Jiedu Quyu Ziyin decoction (JP) is effective in treating SLE and previous clinical studies have proved that JP can prevent and treat SLE steroid osteoporosis (SLE GIOP). We aim to examine JPs main mechanism on SLE GIOP through network pharmacology and molecular docking. Methods. TCMSP and TCMID databases were used to screen potential active compounds and targets of JP. The SLE GIOP targets are collected from GeneCards, OMIM, PharmGkb, TTD, and DrugBank databases. R software was used to obtain the cross targets of JP and SLE GIOP and to perform GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. Cytoscape software was used to make the Chinese Medicines Active Ingredient Intersection Targets network diagram. STRING database construct protein protein interaction network and obtain the core targets. Auto Dock Tools and Pymol software were used for docking. Results. Fifty eight targets overlapped between JP and SLE GIOP were suggested as potential targets of JP in the treatment of SLE GIOP. Network topology analysis identified five core targets. GO enrichment analysis was obtained 1,968 items, and the top 10 biological process, closeness centrality, and molecular function were displayed. A total of 154 signaling pathways were obtained by KEGG enrichment analysis, and the top 30 signaling pathways were displayed. JP was well bound by MAPK1, TP53, and MYC according to the molecular docking results. Conclusion. We investigated the potential targets and signaling pathways of JP against SLE GIOP in this study. It shows that JP is most likely to achieve the purpose of treating SLE GIOP by promoting the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts. A solid theoretical foundation will be provided for the future study of clinical and experimental topics.

AB Proteasome inhibitors represent a promising therapy for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma, a disease that is concomitant with osteolysis and enhanced osteoclast formation. While blockade of the proteosome pathway has been recently shown to influence osteoclast formation and function, the precise molecular cascade underlying these effects is presently unclear. Here, we provide evidence that proteasome inhibitors directly impair osteoclast formation and function via the disruption of key RANK mediated signaling cascades. Disruption of the proteosome pathway using selective inhibitors (MG 132, MG 115, and epoxomicin) resulted in the accumulation of p62 and CYLD, and altered the subcellular targeting and distribution of p62 and TRAF6 in osteoclast like cells. Proteosome inhibition also blocked RANKL induced NF kappa B activation, I kappa B alpha degradation and nuclear translocation of p65. The disruption in RANK signaling correlated dose dependently with an impairment in osteoclastogenesis, with relative potency epoxomicin > MG 132 > MG 115 based on equimolar concentrations. In addition, these inhibitors were found to impact osteoclastic microtubule organization and attenuate bone resorption. Based on these data we propose that deregulation of key RANK mediated signaling cascades (p62, TRAF6, CYLD, and I kappa B alpha) underscores proteasome mediated inhibition of osteolytic bone conditions.

AB The Wnt pathways have been shown to be critical for the fate of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro, but their roles in MSCs in vivo remain poorly characterized due to the lack of stable alterations in their signaling. In the present study, we constructed long term and stable mMSCs lines with activated and inactivated  catenin (the key molecule of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway) or ROR2 (the key molecule of the noncanonical Wnt5a/ROR2 signaling pathway) modifications with lentiviral vectors. We found that the transduction efficiencies mediated by the lentiviral vectors were 92.61 97.04% and were maintained over 20 passages of mMSCs. Transfection by lentiviral vectors not only regulated the mRNA and protein expression of  catenin or ROR2 but also regulated nuclear  catenin accumulation or the Wnt5a/JNK and Wnt5a/PKC pathways belonging to the canonical Wnt and noncanonical Wnt5a/ROR2 pathways, respectively.  Catenin or ROR2 gene overexpression promoted mMSC proliferation, migration and differentiation into osteoblasts, while inhibiting the adipogenic differentiation of mMSCs. In contrast, inactivation of the  catenin or ROR2 genes resulted in the opposite effects. Therefore, these results confirm that lentiviral vector transduction can facilitate sustained and efficient gene modification of the Wnt pathway in mMSCs. This study provides a method to investigate the effects of the Wnt pathway on the fate of mMSCs in vivo and for the further improvement of MSC based therapies. J. Cell. Physiol. 229: 791 800, 2014.

AB Context: Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been successfully used to treat Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Kit(+) gastrointestinal stromal tumors. We have previously shown that imatinib therapy is associated with an increase in trabecular bone volume.
   Objective: In the present study, we performed a prospective analysis of bone indices in imatinib treated CML patients to determine the mechanism responsible for this altered bone remodeling.
   Design, Patients, and Intervention: This study assessed the effects of high dose (600 mg/d) imatinib on bone parameters in newly diagnosed chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome positive CML patients (n = 11) enrolled in the TIDEL II study. At baseline and after 6, 12, and 24 months of treatment, serum markers of bone remodeling were quantitated, dual energy x ray absorptiometry analysis of bone mineral density (BMD) was carried out, and a bone biopsy was collected for histological and micro computed tomography analysis.
   Results: Our studies show that the increase in trabecular bone volume and trabecular thickness after imatinib treatment was associated with a significant decrease in osteoclast numbers, accompanied by a significant decrease in serum levels of a marker of osteoclast activity. In contrast, osteoblast numbers were not altered by up to 24 months of imatinib treatment. Notably, we also found that imatinib caused a site specific decrease in BMD at the femoral neck.
   Conclusions: These data suggest that imatinib therapy dysregulates bone remodeling, causing a generalized decrease in osteoclast number and activity that is not counterbalanced by a decrease in osteoblast activity, leading to increased trabecular bone volume. Further long term investigations are required to determine the causes and consequences of the site specific decrease in BMD at the femoral neck. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 98: 67 76, 2013)

AB Excessive osteoclast activity could cause skeletal diseases including osteoporosis. Additionally, autophagy plays an initial role in osteoclast differentiation and function. Ginkgolide B (GB), a key compound in Ginkgo biloba, improves bone mass and suppresses mature osteoclast formation in vitro. This study examines the role of GB role in regulating osteoclast formation via autophagy. Using murine bone marrow derived macrophages in vitro, we explored GB's effects on autophagy and osteoclast formation. We also assessed bone loss prevention in an ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model using GB combined with an autophagy inhibitor. Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase staining was used to observe osteoclast formation. Autophagy related proteins and intracellular microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta puncta were observed using western blotting and immunofluorescence. The impact of GB on OVX mice was evaluated using micro computed tomography and hematoxylin and eosin staining. GB directly promoted autophagy in osteoclast precursors (OCPs), but inhibited osteoclast differentiation by reducing receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) induced autophagy. GB inhibits the phosphorylation of RANKL downstream signaling pathways, such as Jun N terminal kinase (JNK), p38, and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK). Anisomycin (ANI), a JNK activator, reversed GB's inhibitory effects on RANKL induced autophagy and osteoclastogenesis. Inhibiting autophagy using 3 Methyladenine (3 MA) or small interfering RNA significantly suppressed osteoclast differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggested that GB inhibits osteoclast formation by decreasing JNK phosphorylation and autophagy under RANKL stimulation. Interestingly, GB also directly promotes autophagy in OCPs. Thus, GB markedly reduces osteoclast differentiation and prevents bone loss, with its anti osteoclastogenesis effect being enhanced by 3 MA. Accordingly, inhibiting GB induced direct autophagy could further increase its therapeutic effect on bone disease resulting from excessive osteoclast activity.

AB Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy diagnosed in children and adolescents with a high propensity for local invasion and distant metastasis. Despite current multidisciplinary treatments, there has not been a drastic change in overall prognosis within the last two decades. With current treatments, 60 70 % of patients with localized disease survive. Given a propensity of Wnt signaling to control multiple cellular processes, including proliferation, cell fate determination, and differentiation, it is a critical pathway in OS disease progression. At the same time, this pathway is extremely complex with vast arrays of cross talk. Even though decades of research have linked the role of Wnt to tumorigenesis, there are still outstanding areas that remain poorly understood and even controversial.
   The canonical Wnt pathway functions to regulate the levels of the transcriptional co activator beta catenin, which ultimately controls key developmental gene expressions. Given the central role of this mediator, inhibition of Wnt/beta catenin signaling has been investigated as a potential strategy for cancer control. In OS, several secreted protein families modulate the Wnt/beta catenin signaling, including secreted Frizzled related proteins (sFRPs), Wnt inhibitory protein (WIF), Dickkopf proteins (DKK 1,2,3), sclerostin, and small molecules. This chapter focuses on our current understanding of Wnt/beta catenin signaling in OS, based on recent in vitro and in vivo data. Wnt activates noncanonical signaling pathways as well that are independent of beta catenin which will be discussed. In addition, stem cells and their association with Wnt/beta catenin are important factors to consider. Ultimately, the multiple canonical and noncanonical Wnt/beta catenin agonists and antagonists need to be further explored for potential targeted therapies.

AB Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used in medicine for treatment of chronic diseases. Especially in children, prolonged treatment causes growth retardation and early onset of osteoporosis. Human parathyroid hormone (PTH) has an anabolic effect on bone when administrated intermittently. The aim of the present study was to examine whether a combined therapy of dexamethasone (DEX) and PTH could prevent the detrimental effects of GC on cortical and trabecular bone in the femur and vertebrae of growing mice. Three week old female FVB mice were treated with control, DEX, PTH, or a combination of DEX and PTH by daily subcutaneous injections. After 4 weeks, animals were killed and the femur and L5 vertebra were isolated. Cortical and trabecular bone parameters and relative calcium density were measured by high resolution X ray micro computed tomography (micro CT). In the femur, PTH can reverse the effects of DEX on bone volume to control. However, it cannot reverse the undermineralization, which most likely is a strong contributor to bone fragility. In the vertebra, PTH improves bone volume to some extent but does not restore the values to normal. It augments the negative effect of DEX on mineralization. We conclude that the detrimental effects of DEX in the growing skeleton cannot be prevented by simultaneous PTH treatment.

AB Hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is a rare disorder characterized by hypocalcemia in the presence of a low or inappropriately normal parathyroid hormone level. HypoPT is most commonly seen after neck surgery, which accounts for approximately 75% of cases, whereas approximately 25% have HypoPT due to nonsurgical causes. In both groups of patients, conventional therapy includes calcium and active vitamin D analogue therapy aiming to maintain serum calcium concentration in the low normal or just below the normal reference range and normalize serum phosphorus, magnesium concentrations, and urine calcium levels. The limitations of conventional therapy include wide fluctuations in serum calcium, high pill burden, poor quality of life, and renal complications. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) replacement therapy may improve the biochemical profile in those in whom conventional therapy proves unsatisfactory. Based on a systematic review and meta analysis of the literature, the panel made a graded recommendation suggesting conventional therapy as first line therapy rather than administration of PTH (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). When conventional therapy is deemed unsatisfactory, the panel considers use of PTH. Because pregnancy and lactation are associated with changes in calcium homeostasis close monitoring is required during these periods, with appropriate adjustment of calcium and active vitamin D analogue therapy to ensure that serum calcium remains in the mid to low normal reference range in order to avoid maternal and fetal complications. Emerging therapies include molecules with prolonged PTH action as well as different mechanisms of action that may significantly enhance drug efficacy and safety. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB Osteoclast (OC) is the only cell involved in bone resorption. Dysfunction of OCs leads to a variety of bone diseases. Ligustilide (LIG) is the main component of the volatile oil isolated and purified from Angelica sinensis. LIG exerts many pharmacological activities, but its effects on osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption are still unclear. Our study showed that LIG inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) ligand induced OC formation and activation in a dose dependent manner. Additionally, LIG downregulated the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of OC specific genes, such as V ATPase d2, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase, a dendritic cell specific transmembrane protein, cathepsin K, and nuclear factor of activated T cells cl. Furthermore, LIG blocked the activation of NF kappa B/extracellular signal regulated kinase/p38/immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif signaling pathways. Crucially, the expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 proteins and the expression of receptor activator of NF kappa B mRNA were inhibited by LIG. However, LIG did not affect the formation and mineralization of osteoblasts. Collectively, this observation suggests that LIG may serve as a promising agent for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by abnormal bone resorption.

AB Bone loss is one of the major complications of advanced cancers such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer. Extensive research has revealed that the receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand (RANKL), which is considered to be a key factor in osteoclast differentiation, plays an important role in cancer associated bone resorption. Therefore, agents that can suppress this bone loss have therapeutic potential. In this study, we detected whether quetiapine (QUE), a commonly used atypical antipsychotic drug, can inhibit RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation in vitro and prevent human breast cancer induced bone loss in vivo. RAW 264.7 cells and bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs) were used to detect inhibitory effect of QUE on osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Mouse model of breast cancer metastasis to bone was used to test suppressive effect of QUE on breast cancer induced bone loss in vivo. Our results show that QUE can inhibit RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation from RAW 264.7 cells and BMMs without signs of cytotoxicity. Moreover, QUE reduced the occurrence of MDA MB 231 cell induced osteolytic bone loss by suppressing the differentiation of osteoclasts. Finally, molecular analysis revealed that it is by inhibiting RANKL mediated MAPK and NF kappa B signaling pathways that QUE suppressed the osteoclast differentiation. We demonstrate, for the first time, the novel suppressive effects of QUE on RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation in vitro and human breast cancer induced bone loss in vivo, suggesting that QUE may be a potential therapeutic drug for osteolysis treatment.

AB The modulation of purinergic receptors plays an important role in the regulation of bone formation by the osteoblast. On the other hand, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), members of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily, regulate the differentiation of osteoprogenitor bone cells and stimulate bone formation. In this study, we investigate the effects of several nucleotides on osteoblast differentiation and function, and their relation with the gene expression of osteogenic proteins BMP 2, BMP 4 and BMP 5 as well as of differentiation markers alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bone sialoprotein (BSP). Our results indicate that 100 mu M ATP, ATP gamma S and UTP, but not ADP, ADP beta S or UDP, promote ALP activity in rat primary osteoblasts, showing a peak about day 7 of the treatment. ATP, ATP gamma S and UTP also increase the mRNA levels of ALP, BMP 2, BMP 4, BMP 5 and BSP. Both the ALP activity and ALP and BMP 4 mRNA increments induced by ATP and UTP are inhibited by Ly294002, a PI3K inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in purinergic modulation of osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, bone mineralization enhance 1 and 1.5 fold after culturing osteoblasts in the presence of 100 mu M ATP or UTP, respectively, but not of ADP or UDP for 22 days. This information suggests that P2Y(2) receptors (responsive to ATP, ATP gamma S and UTP) enhance osteoblast differentiation involving PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation and gene expression induction of ALP, BMP 2, BMP 4, BMP 5 and BSP. Our findings state a novel molecular mechanism that involves specific gene expression activation of osteoblast function by the purinoreceptors, which would be of help in setting up new pharmacological strategies for the intervention in bone loss pathologies.

AB Objectives: This study aims to investigate the effects of Traditional Chinese medicine, Periplaneta americana extract (PAE), on osteoblast differentiation of human alveolar bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (hABMMSCs). Materials and Methods: Human alveolar bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells were treated with different concentrations of PAE. Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK 8) assay and transwell migration assay were conducted to evaluate cell proliferation and migration, respectively. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, ALP activity assay, and Alizarin red S staining were performed to detect osteogenesis in hABMMSCs. In addition, real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR) and western blot (WB) assay were performed to evaluate expression levels of osteogenic markers. Finally, RNA sequencing analysis and WB were carried out to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Results: A total of 0.1 mg/ml PAE promoted cell proliferation and migration. PAE also increased ALP activity and mineralized nodule formation of hABMMSCs. In addition, PAE upregulated the expression of osteogenesis related genes (RUNX2, COL1A1, and BGLAP). RNA sequencing analysis revealed that PAE activated the focal adhesion signaling pathway. Treatment with Defactinib, an inhibitor of FAK, attenuated the effects induced by PAE. Conclusions: PAE could enhance osteoblast differentiation of hABMMSCs through focal adhesion signaling pathway, suggesting a therapeutic potential for the alveolar bone defect.

AB Aucubin, an iridoid glycoside found in several plants, such as Eucommia ulmoide and Rehmannia, has various pharmacological effects. Bone formation is a complex process in which osteoblast differentiation plays an important role. This study aimed to investigate the promotion effects of aucubin on osteoblast differentiation in MG63 cells, a human osteoblast like cell line. Aucubin not only improved osteoblast differentiation, as shown by enhanced ALP (alkaline phosphatase) concentration and mineralization in cells, but increased the expression of various cytokines, including collagen I, osteocalcin, osteopontin, integrin beta 1, and Osterix. Aucubin strongly enhanced the levels of BMP2 (bone morphogenetic proteins 2) in MG63 cells, which play a central role during osteoblast differentiation. Further data show that aucubin exposure after 1 day, 7 days, and 14 days enhanced the expression of Smad1, 5, and 8, and the phosphoresced levels of MAPKs (mitogen activated protein kinases) family Erk (extracellular signal regulated kinases), JNK (c Jun NH2 terminal kinases), P38, and Akt (serine/threonine protein kinase)/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)/p70s6k in MG63 cells. This study shows the improved effects of aucubin on osteoblast differentiation in MG63 cells, related to the signaling of BMP2 mediated Smads (drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic proteins), MAPKs, and Akt/mTOR/p70S6K. This study indicates the potential of aucubin for osteoporosis treatment.

AB Diabetes is the most common chronic disease in the world and causes complications with many diseases, such as heart disease and osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a systemic bone disease characterized by imbalance in bone resorption and bone formation. Osteoclast is type of bone cell that functions in bone resorption and plays a critical role in bone remodeling. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, which belong to Thiazolidinediones(TZDs), are commonly used antidiabetic drugs. As PPAR full agonists, they can activate PPAR in a ligand dependent way. Recent studies indicate that these PPAR full agonists have some side effects, such as weight gain and bone loss, which may increase the risk of osteoporosis. In contrast, selective PPAR Modulators (SPPARMs) are novel PPAR ligands that can activate PPAR in different ways and lead to distinct downstream genes. Mice bone marrow cells were stimulated with recombinant mouse RANKL and M CSF to generate osteoclasts. To determine the effect on osteoclasts formation, PPAR ligands (Rosiglitazone, Fmoc L Leu, and Telmisartan) were added at the beginning of the culture. Rosiglitazone significantly increased the differentiation of multinucleated osteoclasts, while osteoclasts formation triggered by SPPARMs was much less than that displayed by rosiglitazone. We found that the enhancement of PPAR ligands may be associated with TRAF6 and downstream ERK signal pathway. We also demonstrated osteoclasts show characteristic M2 phenotype and can be further promoted by PPAR ligands, especially rosiglitazone. In conclusion, reduced osteoclasts differentiation characteristic of SPPARMs highlights SPPARMs potential as therapeutic targets in diabetes, versus traditional antidiabetic drugs. J. Cell.

AB Background: Osteoporosis is a world wide health problem, which leads to decreased bone strength and increased susceptibility to fractures. Puerarin, a phytoestrogen extracted from Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi, has been identified as a promising intervention for preventing bone loss and promoting bone regeneration. However, the underlying mechanisms for its anabolic action are still not clear. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of puerarin on the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and the possible molecular mechanism mediating its action.
   Methods: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and intragastric administration on ovariectomized(OVX) rats were used to study the anti osteoporotic function of puerarin. The involvement of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways was determined.
   Results: Our results demonstrated that at optimal concentration, puerarin could promote osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro. This induction was mediated by MAPK signaling pathway. Further detailed study revealed that ERK1/2 Runx2 signaling pathway had more prominent effect than p38 signaling pathway in puerarin induced differentiation of BMSCs toward the osteogenic phenotype. We also found that puerarin protected against reduction in bone mineral density and improved femur trabecular bone structure in ovariectomized rats.
   Conclusion: Our findings revealed the functional mechanism of puerarin in promoting osteogenic differentiation which involved ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathway and provided experimental evidence for the potential application of puerarin for estrogen replacement therapy of osteoporosis.

AB Objective: To evaluate in vivo and in vitro effects of ferulic acid (FA) on glucocorticoid induced osteoarthritis (GIO) to establish its possible underlying mechanisms. Methods: The effects of FA on cell proliferation, cell viability (MTT assay), ALP activity, and mineralization assay, and oxidative stress markers (ROS, SOD, GSH LDH and MDA levels) were investigated by MC3T3 E1 cell line. Wistar rats received standard saline (control group) or dexamethasone (GC, 2 mg 1 kg) or DEX+FA (50 and 100 mg 1 kg) orally for 8 weeks. Bone density, micro architecture, bio mechanics, bone turnover markers and histo morphology were determined. The expression of OPG, RANKL, osteogenic markers, and other signalling proteins was assessed employing quantitative RT PCR and Western blotting. Results: The findings indicated the elevation of ALP mRNA expressions, osteogenic markers (Runx 2, OSX, Col I, and OSN), and the b Catenin, Lrp 5 and GSK 3b protein expressions. FA showed the potential to increase MC3T3 E1 cell differentiation, proliferation, and mineralization. FA increased oxidative stress markers (SOD, MDA, and GSH) while decreasing ROS levels and lactate dehydrogenase release in GIO rats. The OPG/RANKL mRNA expression ratio was increased by FA, followed by improved GSK 3b and ERK phosphorylation with enhanced mRNA expressions of Lrp 5 and b catenin. Conclusion: These findings showed that FA improved osteoblasts proliferation with oxidative stress suppression by controlling the Lrp 5/GSK 3b/ERK pathway in GIO, demonstrating the potential pathways involved in the mechanism of actions of FA in GIO therapy.

AB Distraction osteogenesis is a fundamental pillar for craniomaxillofacial reconstruction processes. Nonetheless, although the clinical, biomechanical, and histologic changes associated with distraction osteogenesis have been widely described, this is not the case with the molecular mechanisms that regulate bone synthesis in the interfragmentary gap resulting from the gradual separation of bone segments. Recent studies have attributed a decisive role to the RANK/RANKL/OPG system in regulating bone metabolism and osteoclastogenesis. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa beta (RANK), belonging to the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, is present in the osteoclasts. It promotes osteoclastogenesis when it binds to RANK ligand (RANKL), which is produced by the osteoblasts and other stromal cells. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) acts as a decoy receptor by binding to RANKL and preventing RANK signaling. Osteoclast activation is thus blocked and apoptosis induced. The aim of this review is to analyze the influence of the RANK/RANKL/OPG system on the bone healing and remodeling processes that occur in distraction osteogenesis, with a view to possibly developing molecular mechanisms that stimulate bone regeneration and inhibit resorption, thereby improving the clinical outcome for distraction osteogenesis.

AB Oxidative stress (OS) induced mitochondrial damage and the subsequent osteoblast dysfunction contributes to the initiation and progression of osteoporosis. Notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1), isolated from Panax notoginseng, has potent antioxidant effects and has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine. This study aimed to investigate the protective property and mechanism of NGR1 on oxidative damaged osteoblast. Osteoblastic MC3T3 E1 cells were pretreated with NGR1 24 h before hydrogen peroxide administration simulating OS attack. Cell viability, apoptosis rate, osteogenic activity and markers of mitochondrial function were examined. The role of C Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) signalling pathway on oxidative injured osteoblast and mitochondrial function was also detected. Our data indicate that NGR1 (25 mu M) could reduce apoptosis as well as restore osteoblast viability and osteogenic differentiation. NGR1 also reduced OS induced mitochondrial ROS and restored mitochondrial membrane potential, adenosine triphosphate production and mitochondrial DNA copy number. NGR1 could block JNK pathway and antagonize the destructive effects of OS. JNK inhibitor (SP600125) mimicked the protective effects of NGR1while JNK agonist (Anisomycin) abolished it. These data indicated that NGR1 could significantly attenuate OS induced mitochondrial damage and restore osteogenic differentiation of osteoblast via suppressing JNK signalling pathway activation, thus becoming a promising agent in treating osteoporosis.

AB Bone resorbing osteoclasts significantly contribute to osteoporosis and bone metastases of cancer(1 3). MicroRNAs play important roles in physiology and disease(4,5), and present tremendous therapeutic potential(6). Nonetheless, how microRNAs regulate skeletal biology is underexplored. Here we identify miR 34a as a novel and critical suppressor of osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption and the bone metastatic niche. miR 34a is downregulated during osteoclast differentiation. Osteoclastic miR 34a overexpressing transgenic mice exhibit lower bone resorption and higher bone mass. Conversely, miR 34a knockout and heterozygous mice exhibit elevated bone resorption and reduced bone mass. Consequently, ovariectomy induced osteoporosis, as well as bone metastasis of breast and skin cancers, are diminished in osteoclastic miR 34a transgenic mice, and can be effectively attenuated by miR 34a nanoparticle treatment. Mechanistically, we identify transforming growth factor beta induced factor 2 (Tgif2) as an essential direct miR 34a target that is pro osteoclastogenic. Tgif2 deletion reduces bone resorption and abolishes miR 34a regulation. Together, using mouse genetic, pharmacological and disease models, we reveal miR 34a as a key osteoclast suppressor and a potential therapeutic strategy to confer skeletal protection and ameliorate bone metastasis of cancers.

AB Abaloparatide (Tymlos (TM)) is a synthetic peptide analogue of human parathyroid hormone related protein that was developed by Radius Health as an osteoanabolic agent for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Abaloparatide acts through selective activation of the parathyroid hormone type 1 receptor signalling pathway. In April 2017, subcutaneous abaloparatide received its first global approval, in the USA, for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. A Marketing Authorization Application for subcutaneous abaloparatide for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis was accepted by the European Medicines Agency and is currently under review. Radius is also developing a transdermal formulation of abaloparatide, with administration via a microneedle patch. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of abaloparatide leading to this first approval for the treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.

AB Background: RT PCR has been widely used for the analysis of gene expression in many systems, including tumor samples. GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase) has been frequently considered as a constitutive housekeeping gene and used to normalize changes in specific gene expression. However, GAPDH has been shown to be up regulated in many cancers and down regulated by chemotherapic drugs. Bisphosphonates, potent inhibitors of bone resorption, have recently shown a direct and indirect antitumor effect in vitro and in animal models. They exert their effects mainly by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway but also by modulating the expression of many genes not only in osteoclasts but also in cancer cells.
   Methods: We evaluated GAPDH gene expression by real time RT PCR in breast (MCF 7 and T47D) and prostate (PC3 and DU 145) cancer cell lines treated with amino and non amino bisphosphonates.
   Results: Our results showed that amino bisphosphonates significantly decrease in a dose dependent manner the expression of GAPDH gene.
   Conclusion: Therefore, GAPDH is inaccurate to normalize mRNA levels in studies investigating the effect of bisphosphonates on gene expression and it should be avoided. On the other hand, this gene could be considered a potential target to observe the effects of bisphosphonates on cancer cells.

AB The alpha 5 beta 1 integrin is a key fibronectin (EN) receptor that binds to RGD containing peptides to mediate cell adhesion. We previously reported that alpha 5 beta 1 integrin promotes osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal skeletal cells (MSCs), but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we determined the signaling mechanisms induced by alpha 5 beta 1 integrin interaction with its high affinity ligand CRRETAWAC in murine and human MSCs and in vivo. We show that cyclized CRRETAWAC fully displaced MSC adhesion to FN, whereas related peptides lacking the full RRET sequence produced a partial displacement, indicating that RRET acts as an RGD like sequence that is required to antagonize EN mediated cell adhesion. However, all peptides increased focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation, OSE2 transcriptional activity, osteoblast gene expression, and matrix mineralization in MSCs, indicating that peptide induced alpha 5 beta 1 integrin priming can promote osteogenic differentiation independently of the RRET sequence. Biochemical analyses showed that peptide induced alpha 5 beta 1 integrin priming transiently increased PI3K/Akt phosphorylation and promoted Wnt/beta catenin transcriptional activity independently of RRET. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K activity reduced osteoblast differentiation and abolished Wnt regulatory gene expression induced by alpha 5 beta 1 integrin priming. In vivo, systemic delivery of cyclized GACRETAWACGA linked to (DSS)(6) to allow delivery to bone forming sites for 6 weeks increased serum osteocalcin levels and improved long bone mass and microarchitecture in SAMP 6 senescent osteopenic mice. The results support a mechanism whereby alpha 5 beta 1 integrin priming by high affinity ligands integrates Wnt/beta catenin signaling to promote osteoblast differentiation independently of cell adhesion, which could be used to improve bone mass and microarchitecture in the aging skeleton.

AB Postmenopausal osteoporosis (POP) is quite prevalent and many new drugs are under development to obtain better therapeutic outcomes. Oleanolic acid (OA) has been reported to prevent bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) rats by stimulating osteoblastogenesis. One previous study has demonstrated that acetate of OA suppressed lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induced bone loss in mice. However, the role of OA in the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) mediated osteoclastogenesis is still not elucidated. Here we show that OA dose dependently inhibits RANKL mediated osteoclastogenesis and the formation of functional osteoclasts without impairing the viability and osteoclastic potential in bone marrow macrophages (BMMs). Moreover, OA administration attenuates bone loss in OVX mice by inhibiting osteoclast's densities. Mechanistically, OA does not affect RANKL induced activation of the NF kappa B, JNK, p38, ERK and Alt pathways, but inhibits the expression of the nuclear factor of activated T cells c1(NFATc1) and c Fos. Moreover, OA significantly suppresses the expression of RANKL activated osteoclast genes encoding matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), Cathepsin K(Ctsk), tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and carbonic anhydrase ll (Car2). This work has elucidated the molecular mechanism of OA in RANKL mediated osteoclastogenesis and revealed the promising potential of OA to be further developed as a new drug to prevent and treat POP.

AB Several studies have shown that the G protein coupled cannabinoid receptor CB2 and its interaction partner p62 are molecularly involved in bone remodeling processes. Pharmacological activation of the CB2 receptor enhanced bone volume in postmenopausal osteoporosis and arthritis models in rodents, whereas knockout or mutation of the p62 protein in aged mice led to Paget's disease of bone like conditions. Studies of pharmacological CB2 agonist effects on bone metabolism in p62 KO mice have not been performed to date. Here, we assessed the effect of the CB2 specific agonist JWH133 after a short term (5 days in 3 month old mice) or long term (4 weeks in 6 month old mice) treatment on structural, dynamic, and cellular bone morphometry obtained by mu CT of the femur and histomorphometry of the vertebral bodies in p62 KO mice and their WT littermates in vivo. A genotype independent stimulatory effect of CB2 on bone formation, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness after short term treatment and on tissue mineral density after long term treatment was detected, indicating a weak osteoanabolic function of this CB2 agonist. Moreover, after short term systemic CB2 receptor activation, we found significant differences at the cellular level in the number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts only in p62 KO mice, together with a weak increase in trabecular number and a decrease in trabecular separation. Long term treatment showed an opposite JWH133 effect on osteoclasts in WT versus p62 KO animals and decreased cortical thickness only in treated p62 KO mice. Our results provide new insights into CB2 receptor signaling in vivo and suggest that CB2 agonist activity may be regulated by the presence of its macromolecular binding partner p62.

AB Vacuolar type H (+) ATPase (V ATPase) is a highly conserved, ancient enzyme that couples the energy of ATP hydrolysis to proton transport across vesicular and plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells. Previously reported mutations of various V ATPase subunits are associated with increased bone density. We now show that haploinsufficiency for the H subunit of the V 1 domain (ATP6V1H) is associated with osteoporosis in humans and mice. A genome wide SNP array analysis of 1625 Han Chinese found that 4 of 15 tag SNPs (26.7%) within ATP6V1H were significantly associated with low spine bone mineral density. Atp6v1h(+/ ) knockout mice generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 technique had decreased bone remodeling and a net bone matrix loss. Atp6v1h(+/ ) osteoclasts showed impaired bone formation and increased bone resorption. The increased intracellular pH of Atp6v1h(+/ ) osteoclasts downregulated TGF beta 1 activation, thereby reducing induction of osteoblast formation but the bone mineralization was not altered. However, bone formation was reduced more than bone resorption. Our data provide evidence that partial loss of ATP6V1H function results in osteoporosis/osteopenia. We propose that defective osteoclast formation triggers impaired bone formation by altering bone remodeling. In the future, ATP6V1H might, therefore, serve as a target for the therapy of osteoporosis.

AB Understanding periodontal ligament (PDL) biology and developing an effective treatment for bone and PDL damage due to periodontitis have been long standing aims in dental medicine. Here, we first demonstrated by cell lineage tracing and mineral double labeling approaches that murine PDL progenitor cells display a 2  and 3 fold higher mineral deposition rate than the periosteum and endosteum at the age of 4 weeks, respectively. We next proved that the pathologic changes in osteocytes (Ocys; changes from a spindle shape to round shape with a >50% reduction in the dendrite number/length, and an increase in SOST) are the key pathologic factors responsible for bone and PDL damage in periostin null mice (a periodontitis animal model) using a newly developed 3 dimensional FITC Imaris technique. Importantly, we proved that deleting the Sost gene (a potent inhibitor of WNT signaling) or blocking sclerostin function by using the mAb in this periodontitis model significantly restores bone and PDL defects (n = 4 5; P < 0.05). Together, identification of the key contribution of the PDL in normal alveolar bone formation, the pathologic changes of the Ocys in periodontitis bone loss, and the novel link between sclerostin and Wnt signaling in the PDL will aid future drug development in the treatment of patients with periodontitis.

AB Bone is one of the preferred sites for the metastasis of malignant tumours, such as breast cancer, lung cancer and malignant melanoma. Tumour cells colonizing bone have the capacity to induce the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), which promotes osteoclast differentiation and activation. Tumour induced osteoclastic bone resorption leads to a vicious cycle between tumours and bone cells that fuels osteolytic tumour growth, causing bone pain and hypercalcaemia. Furthermore, RANKL contributes to bone metastasis by acting as a chemoattractant to bone for tumour cells that express its receptor, RANK. Thus inhibition of the RANKL RANK pathway is a promising treatment for bone metastasis, and a human monoclonal anti RANKL antibody, denosumab, has been used in the clinic. However, orally available drugs targeting RANKL must be developed to increase the therapeutic benefits to patients. Here we report the efficacy of the small molecule RANKL inhibitor AS2676293 in treating bone metastasis using mouse models. Oral administration of AS2676293 markedly inhibited bone metastasis of human breast cancer cells MDA MB 231 5a D Luc2 as well as tumour induced osteolysis. AS2676293 suppressed RANKL mediated tumour migration in the transwell assay and inhibited bone metastasis of the murine cell line B16F10, which is known not to trigger osteoclast activation. Based on the results from this study, RANKL inhibition with a small molecule compound constitutes a promising therapeutic strategy for treating bone metastasis by inhibiting both osteoclastic bone resorption and tumour migration to bone.

AB Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is a benign tumor of bone presenting as a cystic, expansile lesion in both the axial and appendicular skeleton. Axial lesions demand special consideration, because treatment related morbidity can be devastating. In similar lesions, such as giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB), the receptor activator of nuclear kappaB ligand (RANKL) receptor activator of nuclear kappaB (RANK) signaling axis is essential to tumor progression. Although ABC and GCTB are distinct entities, they both contain abundant multinucleated giant cells and are osteolytic characteristically. We hypothesize that ABCs express both RANKL and RANK similarly in a cell type specific manner, and that targeted RANKL therapy will mitigate ABC tumor progression. Cellular expression of RANKL and RANK was determined in freshly harvested ABC samples using laser confocal microscopy. A consistent cell type specific pattern was observed: fibroblastlike stromal cells expressed RANKL strongly whereas monocyte/macrophage precursor and multinucleated giant cells expressed RANK. Relative RANKL expression was determined by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction in ABC and GCTB tissue samples; no difference in relative expression was observed (P > 0.05). In addition, we review the case of a 5 year old boy with a large, aggressive sacral ABC. After 3 months of targeted RANKL inhibition with denosumab, magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated tumor shrinkage, bone reconstitution, and healing of a pathologic fracture. Ambulation, and bowel and bladder function were restored at 6 months. Denosumab treatment was well tolerated. Post hoc analysis demonstrated strong RANKL expression in the pretreatment tumor sample. These findings demonstrate that RANKL RANK signal activation is essential to ABC tumor progression. RANKL targeted therapy may be an effective alternative to surgery in select ABC presentations.

AB Biological processes utilize energy and therefore must be prioritized based on fuel availability. Bone is no exception to this, and the benefit of remodeling when necessary outweighs the energy costs. Bone remodeling is important for maintaining blood calcium homeostasis, repairing micro cracks and fractures, and modifying bone structure so that it is better suited to withstand loading demands. Osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes are the primary cells responsible for bone remodeling, although bone marrow adipocytes and other cells may also play an indirect role. There is a renewed interest in bone cell energetics because of the potential for these processes to be targeted for osteoporosis therapies. In contrast, due to the intimate link between bone and energy homeostasis, pharmaceuticals that treat metabolic disease or have metabolic side effects often have deleterious bone consequences. In this brief review, we will introduce osteoporosis, discuss how bone cells utilize energy to function, evidence for bone regulating whole body energy homeostasis, and some of the unanswered questions and opportunities for further research in the field.

AB Optogenetics enables precise regulation of intracellular signaling in target cells. However, the application of optogenetics to induce the differentiation of precursor cells and generate mature cells with specific functions has not yet been fully explored. Here, we focused on osteoclasts, which play an important role in bone remodeling, to develop a novel optogenetics tool, Opto RANK, which can manipulate intracellular signals involved in osteoclast differentiation and maturation using blue light. We engineered Opto RANK variants, Opto RANKc and Opto RANKm, and generated stable cell lines through retroviral transduction. Differentiation was induced by blue light, and various assays were conducted for functional analysis. Osteoclast precursor cells expressing Opto RANK differentiated into multinucleated giant cells on light exposure and displayed upregulation of genes normally induced in differentiated osteoclasts. Furthermore, the differentiated cells exhibited bone resorbing activities, with the possibility of spatial control of the resorption by targeted light illumination. These results suggested that Opto RANK cells differentiated by light possess the features of osteoclasts, both morphological and functional. Thus, Opto RANK should be useful for detailed spatiotemporal analysis of intracellular signaling during osteoclast differentiation and the development of new therapies for various bone diseases.

   treat to target
ID DISCONTINUATION
AB Denosumab discontinuation can lead to bone loss despite subsequent bisphosphonate therapy. This bone loss is more severe in patients treated with denosumab for longer than 3 years. We aimed to evaluate the bone mass changes after only a single denosumab injection followed by zoledronate administration. We screened all of our patients who received a single denosumab injection and who were included in the osteoporosis register from the Swiss Society of Rheumatology between August 1, 2010, and January 31, 2022. This case series assessed the outcome of patients who were consecutively treated with one denosumab injection followed by a single infusion of zoledronate 6 months later. Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover markers (BTM) changes were analysed before therapy and 18 months later. Percentage BMD changes and T scores were compared with those of registered patients who received 2.5 years of denosumab treatment and one sub sequent infusion of zoledronate. Thirty two patients (31 female, 1 male) received a single denosumab injection and one zoledronate infusion 6 months later. BTM decreased significantly in this period (p = 0.035). Percent age BMD changes from baseline to 1 year after zoledronate treatment were 7.6% [IQR 3.2, 9.4] at the lumbar spine, 3.5% [1.8, 5.9] at the total hip and 4.6% [1.3, 6.0] at the femoral neck. In contrast, percentage changes from baseline in 110 patients with 2.5 years of denosumab treatment and one zoledronate infusion were 5.6% [3.0, 9.1], 2.3% [0.2, 4.9] and 2.3% [ 0.9, 4.7], respectively. Differences between the 2 groups were significant at the lumbar spine (p = 0.014), total hip (p = 0.010) and femoral neck (p = 0.010). A single denosumab injection followed by zoledronate led to a remarkable gain of BMD at the lumbar spine and hip within a short time. This observation could help to identify a new short treatment sequence for patients with osteoporosis.

AB Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS) is necessary for osteoclast survival and activity and is considered as a major molecular target of aminobisphosphonates. Our objective was to analyze the influence of FDPS polymorphisms on bone mineral density (BMD) and the response to antiresortive drugs. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms of FDPS were analyzed in 1186 postmenopausal women. There was only a marginally significant association of baseline hip BMD with rs11264359 alleles (P = 0.043). However, among 191 women receiving antiresortive therapy, there was a very significant association between rs2297480 or rs11264359 alleles and the BMD changes after aminobisphosphonate therapy for an average period of 2.5 years (P = 0.001). The genotype explained 7.2% of the variance in the BMD response. On the other hand, there was no association between the BMD changes after raloxifene therapy and any of the polymorphisms studied. These results suggest that common polymorphisms of the FDPS gene influence the response to aminobisphosphonates.

AB Background and PurposeOsteoporosis is a condition characterized by a decrease in bone density, which decreases its strength and results in fragile bones. The endocannabinoid/endovanilloid system has been shown to be involved in the regulation of skeletal remodelling. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible modulation of bone mass mediated by the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 channel (TRPV1) in vivo and in vitro.
   Experimental ApproachA multidisciplinary approach, including biomolecular, biochemical and morphological analysis, was used to investigate the involvement of TRPV1 in changes in bone density in vivo and osteoclast activity in vitro, in wild type and Trpv1( / ) mice, that had undergone ovariectomy or had a sham operation.
   Key ResultsGenetic deletion of Trpv1 as well as pharmacological inhibition/desensitization of TRPV1 signalling dramatically reduced the osteoclast activity in vitro and prevented the ovariectomy induced bone loss in vivo, whereas the expression of cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) receptors was increased.
   Conclusions and ImplicationsThese findings highlight the pivotal role TRPV1 channels play in bone resorption and suggest a possible cross talk between TRPV1 and CB2 receptors. Based on these results, hybrid compounds acting on both TRPV1 and CB2 receptors in an opposite manner could provide a future pharmacological tool for the treatment of diseases associated with disturbances in the bone remodelling process.

AB Cold physical plasma (CPP), a partially ionized gas that simultaneously generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, is suggested to provide advantages in regenerative medicine. Intraoperative CPP therapy targeting pathologies related to diminished bone quality could be promising in orthopedic surgery. Assessment of a clinically approved plasma jet regarding cellular effects on primary bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (hBM MSCs) from relevant arthroplasty patient cohorts is needed to establish CPP based therapeutic approaches for bone regeneration. Thus, the aim of this study was to derive biocompatible doses of CPP and subsequent evaluation of human primary hBM MSCs' osteogenic and immunomodulatory potential. Metabolic activity and cell proliferation were affected in a treatment time dependent manner. Morphometric high content imaging analyses revealed a decline in mitochondria and nuclei content and increased cytoskeletal compactness following CPP exposure. Employing a nontoxic exposure regime, investigation on osteogenic differentiation did not enhance osteogenic capacity of hBM MSCs. Multiplex analysis of major hBM MSC cytokines, chemokines and growth factors revealed an anti inflammatory, promatrix assembling and osteoclast regulating secretion profile following CPP treatment and osteogenic stimulus. This study can be noted as the first in vitro study addressing the influence of CPP on hBM MSCs from individual donors of an arthroplasty clientele.

AB Osteoclasts are bone resorbing cells differentiated from macrophage/monocyte lineage precursors upon receptor activator of NF ?B ligand (RANKL) stimulation. In a proteomic approach to identify proteins involved in osteoclastogenesis, we observed a dramatic increase in the expression of neurite outgrowth inhibitor A (Nogo A) upon RANKL stimulation of mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) in a nuclear factor of activated T cell cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) dependent manner. The knockdown of Nogo A in BMMs significantly reduced RANKL dependent osteoclast differentiation accompanied by diminished NFATc1 induction, suggesting that a positive feedback mechanism is involved. Conversely, Nogo A overexpression in BMMs as well as in RAW264.7 macrophages greatly augmented osteoclastogenesis, with concomitant increase in the NFATc1 induction. Both the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and calcium oscillation, which are central to RANKL dependent NFATc1 activation and induction, were enhanced by Nogo A. Finally, Nogo A knockdown in mouse calvariae prevented interleukin 1 (IL 1) induced bone loss. These findings not only reveal an unprecedented extraneural role of Nogo A in osteoclastogenesis but also suggest a novel drug target against bone lytic diseases.

AB Osteoarthritis is no doubt a difficult disease to manage. Targeted delivery of drugs to bone may not only enhance the treatment efficacy, but also reduces the quantity of drug administered. In this paper, we have synthesized two series of NSAID Glu oligopeptide conjugates built up by the therapeutic moiety (naproxen and ibuprofen) and the targeting moieties (Glutamic oligopeptides) via amide linkage, as novel potential bone targeting NSAIDs prodrugs. Preliminary studies indicated that these prodrugs exhibited outstanding hydroxyapatite affinity, furthermore, NSAIDs glutamic hexa peptide conjugates were found more potent in hydroxyapatite binding. The adequate chemical stability of the conjugates in different buffers, indicated that the conjugates might become a promising approach of selective delivery of drugs to bone tissues. These results may be conducive to the study of bone targeting drugs delivery.

AB BackgroundNovel bone substitutes are urgently needed in experimental research and clinical orthopaedic applications. There are many traditional Chinese medicines that have effects on bone repair. However, application of natural medicines in traditional Chinese medicine to bone tissue engineering and its mechanism were rarely reported.ResultsIn this study, the osteogenic ability of bioactive glass particles (BGPs) and the osteogenic and osteoclastic ability of neferine (Nef) were fused into PLGA based bone tissue engineering materials for bone regeneration. BGPs were prepared by spray drying and calcination. Particles and Nef were then mixed with PLGA solution to prepare porous composites by the phase conversion method. Here we showed that Nef inhibited proliferation and enhanced ALP activity of MC3T3 E1 cells in a dose  and time dependent manner. And the composites containing Nef could also inhibit RANKL induced osteoclast formation (p < 0.05). Mechanistically, the PLGA/BGP/Nef composite downregulated the expression of NFATC1 by inhibiting the NF & kappa;B pathway to restrain osteoclasts. In the other hands, PLGA/BGP/Nef composite was first demonstrated to effectively activate the IGF 1R/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to enhance IGF 1 mediated osteogenic differentiation. The results of animal experiments show that the material can effectively promote the formation and maturation of new bone in the skull defect site.ConclusionsThe PLGA/BGP/Nef porous composite can restrain osteoclasts by inhibiting the NF & kappa;B pathway, enhance IGF 1 mediated osteogenic differentiation and promotes bone regeneration, and has the potential for clinical application.

AB Bisphosphonates are a class of drugs that induce bone cancer cell death and favor bone regeneration, making them suitable for bone cancer treatment. However, when combined with bioactive glasses to enhance bone regeneration, a chemical bond between biphosphonates and the glass surface inactivates their mechanism of action. A new colloidal hydrogel based drug delivery system could overcome that limitation once bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid (ZA), are incorporated into hydrogel micelles, avoiding their interaction with the glass surface. In this work, we proposed formulations based on a poloxamer 407 thermo responsive hydrogel matrix containing holmium doped bioactive glass nanoparticles and different concentrations (0.05 and 5 mg/ mL) of ZA. We characterized the influence of the glass and the ZA on the hydrogel properties. In addition, a drug concentration screening was performed, and biological characterizations evaluated the best result. The biological characterization consisted of evaluating cytotoxicity and in vitro bone regeneration ability through cell migration and quantification of genes related to osteogeneses through RT PCR. The results suggest that the addition of glasses and ZA to the poloxamer did not significantly influence the sol gel transition of the hydrogels (around 13 degrees C) regardless of the ZA content. However, the ZA at high concentration (PL ZA100) decreased the enthalpy of gel formation from 68 to 43 kJ.mol  1 when compared with the pure hydrogel formulation (PL), suggesting a water structurer role of ZA, which is withdrawn when glass particles are added to the system (PL BG5Ho ZA100). Solid state 31P nuclear resonance spectroscopy results showed that part of the ZA is chemically bonded to the glass surface, which explains the withdrawal in the water structurer role of ZA when the glasses were incorporated into the hydrogel. Besides, based on the drug release results, we proposed a model where part of the ZA is "free," encapsulated in the hydrogel matrix, while another part of the ZA is bonded to the glass surface. Finally, considering the in vitro results and our proposed model, the ratio between "free" and "bonded" ZA in our drug delivery systems showed in vitro evidence of a cancer treatment that selectively kills osteosarcoma cells while still favoring an osteogenic microenvironment. By overcoming the limitation of combining bisphosphonates with bioactive glasses, hydrogel based drug delivery systems can be a solution for the development of new formulations proposed for bone cancer treatment in conjunction with bone regeneration.

AB Estrogen deficiency expands hemopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and mature blood lineages, but the involved mechanism and the affected HSPC populations are mostly unknown. Here we show that ovariectomy (ovx) expands short term HSPCs (ST HSPCs) and improves blood cell engraftment and host survival after bone marrow (BM) transplantation through a dual role of the T cell costimulatory molecule CD40 ligand (CD40L). This surface receptor is required for ovx to stimulate T cell production of Wnt10b, a Wnt ligand that activates Wnt signaling in HSPCs and stromal cells (SCs). Moreover, CD40L is required for ovx to increase SC production of the hemopoietic cytokines interleukin (IL) 6, IL 7, and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor. Attesting to the relevance of CD40L and Wnt10b, ovx fails to expand ST HSPCs in CD40L null mice and in animals lacking global or T cell expression of Wnt10b. In summary, T cells expressed CD40L, and the resulting increased production of Wnt10b and hemopoietic cytokines by T cells and SCs, respectively, plays a pivotal role in the mechanism by which ovx regulates hemopoiesis. The data suggest that antiestrogens may represent pharmacological targets to improve ST HSPC function through activation of the microenvironment.

AB At present, the drug treatment of osteoporosis is mostly focused on inhibiting osteoclastogenesis, which has relatively poor effects. Metformin is a drug that can potentially promote osteogenic differentiation and improve bone mass in postmenopausal women. We aimed to detect the molecular mechanism underlying the osteogenic effect of metformin. Our study indicated that metformin obviously increased the Alkaline phosphatase activity and expression of osteogenic marker genes at the mRNA and protein levels. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was revealed to play an essential role in the metformin induced osteogenic process, as shown by RNA sequencing. We added LY294002 to inhibit the PI3K/AKT pathway, and the results indicated that the osteogenic effect of metformin was also blocked. Additionally, the sequencing data also indicated oxidation reduction reaction was involved in the osteogenic process of osteoblasts. We used H2O2 to mimic the oxidative damage of osteoblasts, but metformin could attenuate it. Antioxidative Nrf2/HO 1 pathway, regarded as the downstream of PI3K/AKT pathway, was modulated by metformin in the protective process. We also revealed that metformin could improve bone mass and oxidative level of OVX mice. In conclusion, our study revealed that metformin promoted osteogenic differentiation and H2O2 induced oxidative damage of osteoblasts via the PI3K/AKT/Nrf2/HO 1 pathway.

AB The development of methods for differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) into functional cells have helped to analyze the mechanism regulating cellular processes and to explore cell based assays for drug discovery. Although several reports have demonstrated methods for differentiation of mouse ESCs into osteoclast like cells, it remains unclear whether these methods are applicable for differentiation of iPSCs to osteoclasts. In this study, we developed a simple method for stepwise differentiation of mouse ESCs and iPSCs into bone resorbing osteoclasts based upon a monoculture approach consisting of three steps. First, based on conventional hanging drop methods, embryoid bodies (EBs) were produced from mouse ESCs or iPSCs. Second, EBs were cultured in medium supplemented with macrophage colony stimulating factor (M CSF), and differentiated to osteoclast precursors, which expressed CD11b. Finally, ESC  or iPSC derived osteoclast precursors stimulated with receptor activator of nuclear factor B ligand (RANKL) and M CSF formed large multinucleated osteoclast like cells that expressed tartrate resistant acid phosphatase and were capable of bone resorption. Molecular analysis showed that the expression of osteoclast marker genes such as Nfatc1, Ctsk, and Acp5 are increased in a RANKL dependent manner. Thus, our procedure is simple and easy and would be helpful for stem cell based bone research.

AB Osteoclasts are of hematopoietic lineage and have the ability to degrade mineralized bone tissues. Abnormalities in osteoclastic activity under certain pathological conditions are common in bone diseases such as osteoporosis, osteosclerosis, and arthritis. Although many kinds of drugs are currently used to treat osteoporosis, they have obvious adverse reactions and limitations. CYT387 is a new small molecule Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor involved in hematopoiesis, immune modulation, fertility, lactation, and embryonic development. However, it has remained unclear whether CYT387 functionally impacts osteoclast formation. Our study demonstrated through osteoclast formation assay in vitro, that the use of CYT387 is a potential drug candidate for treating osteoclast associated bone disease. The effects of CYT387 on osteoclast formation, bone resorption, NFATc1 activation, and especially intracellular ROS levels were investigated in vitro. Further, we examined the preclinical prospects of CYT387 using an oophorectomy (OVX) mouse model of osteoporosis with its anti osteoclast activity in vivo. On the whole, this study shows that CYT387 holds promise for treating osteoclast related bone illnesses including osteoporosis.

AB Extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields have been considered a potential candidate for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis; however, their action mechanism and optimal magnetic flux density (intensity) parameter are still elusive. The present study found that 50 Hz sinusoidal electromagnetic fields (SEMFs) at 1.8 mT increased the peak bone mass of young rats by increasing bone formation. Gene array expression studies with femoral bone samples showed that SEMFs increased the expression levels of collagen 1 alpha 1 and Wnt10b, a critical ligand of the osteogenic Wnt/beta catenin pathway. Consistently, SEMFs promoted osteogenic differentiation and maturation of rat calvarial osteoblasts (ROBs) in vitro through activating the Wnt10b/beta catenin pathway. This osteogenesis promoting effect of SEMFs via Wnt10b/beta catenin signaling was found to depend on the functional integrity of primary cilia in osteoblasts. When the primary cilia were abrogated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting IFT88, the ability of SEMFs to promote the osteogenic differentiation of ROBs through activating Wnt10b/beta catenin signaling was blocked. Although the knockdown of Wnt10b expression with RNA interference had no effect on primary cilia, it significantly suppressed the promoting effect of SEMFs on osteoblastic differentiation/maturation. Wnt10b was normally localized at the bases of primary cilia, but it disappeared (or was released) from the cilia upon SEMF treatment. Interestingly, primary cilia were elongated to different degrees by different intensities of 50 Hz SEMFs, with the window effect observed at 1.8 mT, and the expression level of Wnt10b increased in accord with the lengths of primary cilia. These results indicate that 50 Hz 1.8 mT SEMFs increase the peak bone mass of growing rats by promoting osteogenic differentiation/maturation of osteoblasts, which is mediated, at least in part, by Wnt10b at the primary cilia and the subsequent activation of Wnt/beta catenin signaling.

AB The cellular mechanisms that induce calcific aortic stenosis are yet to be unraveled. Wnt signaling is increasingly being considered as a major player in the disease process. However, the presence of Wnt Frizzled (Fzd) receptors and co receptors LRP5 and 6 in normal and diseased human aortic valves remains to be elucidated. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to determine Fzd receptor expression in normal and calcified human aortic valve tissue, as well as human aortic valve interstitial cells (HAVICs) isolated from calcified and normal human aortic valves. There was significantly higher mRNA expression of 4 out of the 10 Fzd receptors in calcified aortic valve tissues and 8 out of the 10 in HAVICs, and both LRP5/6 co receptors in calcified aortic valves (P < 0.05). These results were confirmed by immunohistochemistry, which revealed abundant increase in immunoreactivity for Fzd3, 7, and 8, mainly in areas of lipid core and calcified nodules of diseased aortic valves. The findings of abundant expression of Fzd and LRP5/6 receptors in diseased aortic valves suggests a potential role for both canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling in the pathogenesis of human aortic valve calcification. Future investigations aimed at targeting these molecules may provide potential therapies for aortic valve stenosis.

AB Objectives: Bisphosphonates become adsorbed on hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone matrix. In case of side effects, stopping the treatment would not affect the bisphosphonates already deposited in bone. This study tests the feasibility of in vivo targeted removal of bisphosphonates from bone using chelating agents.
   Design: 32 Sprague Dawley rats were given an injection of fluorescent pamidronate (OsteoSense EX; 0.16 nmol/g). They were treated with either systemic (cadmium) or local [ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA) or citric acid (CA)] chelating agents to induce the removal of the bisphosphonate from bone. We evaluated the decrease in fluorescence in the alveolar bone, femur, tibia, and vertebrae. We also analyzed the systemic effects of treatment.
   Results: Systemic chelation reduced the pamidronate signal universally. However, the maximum reduction was observed in the alveolar bone and femur (22% and 21%, p values 0.008 and 0.028, respectively). Systemic chelation did not impair calcium homeostasis. The chelation effect was not due to a systemic toxic effect on the liver or kidney. On the other hand local chelation at the extraction site significantly (p = 0.011) decreased the pamidronate signal at bony surfaces of the socket.
   Conclusions: Systemic and local chelating agents can remove bisphosphonate from bone. This study establishes a new concept for the prevention of side effects of bisphosphonates during high risk situations. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Zoledronic acid (Zol) is a potent bisphosphonate that inhibits the differentiation of monocytes into osteoclasts. It is often used in combination with dexamethasone (Dex), a glucocorticoid that promotes the resolution of inflammation, to treat malignant diseases, such as multiple myeloma. This treatment can result in bone pathologies, namely medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw, with a poor understanding of the molecular mechanism on monocyte differentiation. IFN beta is a pro resolving cytokine well known as an osteoclast differentiation inhibitor. Here, we explored whether Zol and/or Dex regulate macrophage osteoclastic differentiation via IFN beta. RAW 264.7 and peritoneal macrophages were treated with Zol and/or Dex for 4 24 h, and IFN beta secretion was examined by ELISA, while the IFN stimulated gene (ISG) 15 expression was evaluated by Western blotting. RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis of RAW 264.7 cells was determined by TRAP staining following treatment with Zol+Dex or IFN beta and anti IFN beta antibodies. We found only the combination of Zol and Dex increased IFN beta secretion by RAW 264.7 macrophages at 4 h and, correspondingly, ISG15 expression in these cells at 24 h. Moreover, Zol+Dex blocked osteoclast differentiation to a similar extent as recombinant IFN beta. Neutralizing anti IFN beta antibodies reversed the effect of Zol+Dex on ISG15 expression and partially recovered osteoclastic differentiation induced by each drug alone or in combination. Finally, we found Zol+Dex also induced IFN beta expression in peritoneal resolution phase macrophages, suggesting these drugs might be used to enhance the resolution of acute inflammation. Altogether, our findings suggest Zol+Dex block the differentiation of osteoclasts through the expression of IFN beta. Revealing the molecular pathway behind this regulation may lead to the development of IFN beta based therapy to inhibit osteoclastogenesis in multiple myeloma patients.

TI Targeted inhibition of osteoclastogenesis reveals the pathogenesis and

AB Sympathetic cues via the adrenergic signaling critically regulate bone homeostasis and contribute to neurostress induced bone loss, but the mechanisms and therapeutics remain incompletely elucidated. Here, we reveal an osteoclastogenesis centered functionally important osteopenic pathogenesis under sympatho adrenergic activation with characterized microRNA response and efficient therapeutics. We discovered that osteoclastic miR 21 was tightly regulated by sympatho adrenergic cues downstream the beta 2 adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) signaling, critically modulated osteoclastogenesis in vivo by inhibiting programmed cell death 4 (Pdcd4), and mediated detrimental effects of both isoproterenol (ISO) and chronic variable stress (CVS) on bone. Intriguingly, without affecting osteoblastic bone formation, bone protection against ISO and CVS was sufficiently achieved by a (D Asp(8)) lipid nanoparticle mediated targeted inhibition of osteoclastic miR 21 or by clinically relevant drugs to suppress osteoclastogenesis. Collectively, these results unravel a previously underdetermined molecular and functional paradigm that osteoclastogenesis crucially contributes to sympatho adrenergic regulation of bone and establish multiple targeted therapeutic strategies to counteract osteopenias under stresses.

AB The Brtl mouse, a knock in model for moderately severe osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), has a G349C substitution in half of type I collagen alpha 1(I) chains. We studied the cellular contribution to Brtl bone properties. Brtl cortical and trabecular bone are reduced before and after puberty, with BV/TV decreased 40 45%. Brtl ObS/BS is comparable to wildtype, and Brtl and wildtype marrow generate equivalent number of colony forming units (CFUs) at both ages. However, OcS/BS is increased in Brtl at both ages (36 45%), as are TRACP(+) cell numbers (57 47%). After puberty, Brtl ObS/BS decreases comparably to wildtype mice, but osteoblast matrix production (MAR) decreases to one half of wildtype values. In contrast, Brtl OcS falls only moderately (similar to 16%), and Brtl TRACP staining remains significantly elevated compared with wildtype. Consequently, Brtl BFR decreases from normal at 2 mo to one half of wildtype values at 6 mo. Immunohistochemistry and real time RT PCR show increased RANK, RANKL, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels in Brtl, although a normal RANKL/OPG ratio is maintained. TRACP(+) precursors are markedly elevated in Brtl marrow cultures and form more osteoclasts, suggesting that osteoclast increases arise from more RANK expressing precursors. We conclude that osteoblasts and osteoclasts are unsynchronized in Brtl bone. This cellular imbalance results in declining BFR as Brtl ages, consistent with reduced femoral geometry. The disparity in cellular number and function results from poorly functioning osteoblasts in addition to increased RANK expressing precursors that respond to normal RANKL/OPG ratios to generate more bone resorbing osteoclasts. Interruption of the stimulus that increases osteoclast precursors may lead to novel OI therapies.

AB Osteoblasts are an important cellular component of the bone microenvironment controlling bone formation and hematopoiesis. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which osteoblasts regulate these processes is a rapidly growing area of research given the important implications for bone therapy, regenerative medicine, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Here we summarize our current knowledge regarding the cellular and molecular crosstalk driving bone formation and hematopoiesis and will discuss the implications of a recent finding demonstrating that osteoblasts are a cellular source of erythropoietin.

AB Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonates for metastatic bone disease. ONJ incidence, risk factors, and outcomes were evaluated in a combined analysis of three phase III trials in patients with metastatic bone disease receiving antiresorptive therapies.
   Patients with bone metastases secondary to solid tumors or myeloma were randomly assigned to receive either s.c. denosumab (120 mg) or i.v. zoledronic acid (4 mg) every 4 weeks. On study oral examinations were conducted by investigators at baseline and every 6 months. Oral adverse events were adjudicated by an independent blinded committee of dental experts.
   Of 5723 patients enrolled, 89 (1.6%) patients were determined to have ONJ: 37 (1.3%) received zoledronic acid and 52 (1.8%) received denosumab (P = 0.13). Tooth extraction was reported for 61.8% of patients with ONJ. ONJ treatment was conservative in > 95% of patients. As of October 2010, ONJ resolved in 36.0% of patients (29.7% for zoledronic acid and 40.4% for denosumab).
   In this combined analysis of three prospective trials, ONJ was infrequent, management was mostly conservative, and healing occurred in over one third of the patients. Educating physicians about oral health before and during bone targeted therapy may help reduce ONJ incidence and improve outcomes.

AB Selective control of cell function by applying specifically configured, low energy, time varying electromagnetic fields (EMF) has added a new, exciting dimension to biology and medicine. However, the mechanism involved is less clear. In our study, we investigated the effect of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) on induction of osteoclasts apoptosis. A statistically significant increase of apoptotic rate in osteoclasts ( 48 hr after isolation) was found when exposed to 7.5 Hz PEMF with induced electric fields intensity of 3.0 mu v/ cm for 8 ( 105%, p < 0.001) and 16 hr ( 30%, p < 0.05). However, exposure of osteoclasts to PEMF for only 1 hr showed no statistically significant differences. These findings suggest that PEMF have the ability to speed up apoptosis of osteoclasts derived from primary osteoblasts and bone marrow cells cocultures. This in vitro study, therefore, could be considered as groundwork for in vivo PEMF applications on some osteoclasts associated bone diseases such as osteoporosis.

AB Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder, with up to 50% of patients clinically displaying skeletal defects. Currently, the pathogenesis of bone disorders in NF1 patients is unclear, and there are no effective preventive and treatment measures. In this study, we found that knockout of the NF1 gene reduced cAMP levels and osteogenic differentiation in an osteoblast model, and icariin activated the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway to promote osteoblast differentiation of the NF1 gene knockout cell model by increasing intracellular cAMP levels. The PKA selective inhibitor H89 significantly impaired the stimulatory effect of icariin on osteogenesis in the NF1 cell model. In this study, an osteoblast model of NF1 was successfully constructed, and icariin was applied to the cell model for the first time. The results will help to elucidate the molecular mechanism of NF1 bone disease and provide new ideas for the clinical prevention and treatment of NF1 bone disease and drug development in the future.

AB To examine the effects of hydrogen amount altered biomimetic DLC film, osteoblastic MC3T3 E1 cells and osteoclastic RAW264.7 cells were cultured on titanium (Ti) disks coated with or without DLC including various amount of hydrogen. The amount of hydrogen in DLC film is reduced from 20.9% to 0.8%. Real time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that type I collagen mRNA in MC3T3 E1 cells cultured on specific hydrogen containing DLC coated Ti disks was significantly higher than those of control Ti disks. In addition, specific hydrogen containing DLC coated Ti disks significantly inhibited the expression of TRAP mRNA in RANKL treated RAW264.7 cells. These results, taken together, suggested that biomimetic DLC altered osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation, which could promise long term success of implant therapy.

AB Background: Bone homeostasis is mediated by osteoblast related bone formation and osteoclast related resorption. The imbalance of bone homeostasis due to excessive osteoclastogenesis or reduced osteogenesis can result in various disorders, such as postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP). The receptor activator of nuclear factor icB ligand (RANKL) induced nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF icB) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are essential in osteoclastogenesis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of rosavin, an alkylbenzene diglycoside compound from the traditional Chinese medicine Rhodiola Rosea L, on RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in vivo.
   Methods: The effects of rosavin on osteoclastogenesis were assessed by TRAP staining of bone marrow monocyte cells (BMMCs) and RAW 264.7 cells. The effects of rosavin on osteogenesis were determined using alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alizarin red staining, as well as real time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Actin ring formation and bone formation experiments were performed to evaluate osteoclast function. Western blotting was carried out to determine the expression of osteoclastogenesis related genes, and the activation of the NF icB and MAPK pathways was evaluated by performing western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. Ovariectomized mice were used to explore the effect of rosavin on bone loss.
   Results: Rosavin could inhibit osteoclastogenesis, suppress the function of osteoclasts, and decrease the expression of osteoclast differentiation related genes, including tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin K, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP 9), calcitonin receptor (CTR), TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF 6), receptor activator of nuclear factor icB (RANK), and colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (c fms). Rosavin inhibited RANKL induced phosphorylation of p65 and inhibitory subunit of NF icB alpha (IicBot), and suppressed p65 nuclear translocation. Rosavin was also found to inhibit the phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and c Jun N terminal kinase (JNK). Furthermore, rosavin promoted osteogenesis in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). In vivo experiments showed that treatment with rosavin could alleviate ovariectomy induced osteoporosis in mice. Conclusions: Our results indicated that rosavin suppressed RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis in vivo and in vitro by blocking the NF icB and MAPK pathways. Rosavin treatment is a potential therapy for the clinical treatment of osteoclastogenesis related disorders.

AB Understanding the role of neuropilin 2 (NRP2) in prostate cancer cells as well as in the bone microenvironment is pivotal in the development of an effective targeted therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer bone metastasis. We observed a significant upregulation of NRP2 in prostate cancer cells metastasized to bone. Here, we report that targeting NRP2 in cancer cells can enhance taxane based chemotherapy with a better therapeutic outcome in bone metastasis, implicating NRP2 as a promising therapeutic target. Since, osteoclasts present in the tumor microenvironment express NRP2, we have investigated the potential effect of targeting NRP2 in osteoclasts. Our results revealed NRP2 negatively regulates osteoclast differentiation and function in the presence of prostate cancer cells that promotes mixed bone lesions. Our study further delineated the molecular mechanisms by which NRP2 regulates osteoclast function. Interestingly, depletion of NRP2 in osteoclasts in vivo showed a decrease in the overall prostate tumor burden in the bone. These results therefore indicate that targeting NRP2 in prostate cancer cells as well as in the osteoclastic compartment can be beneficial in the treatment of prostate cancer bone metastasis.

AB Healthy bone undergoes a continuous cycle of bone resorption by osteoclasts and formation by osteoblasts. These processes are in turn regulated by developmental sequences involved in differentiation of bone marrow puripotent mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts and mononuclear hemaotpoitic stem cells into osteoclasts. A variety of growth factors and receptors are involved in these maturation sequences. Osteoblast proliferation and inhibition, for example, are highly dependent not only on such factors as bone morphogenic protein and core binding factor a1 (CBFa1), but on intracellular levels of calcium and cAMP. Therefore, agents that affect concentrations of these two compounds may hypothetically play a role in osteoblastic osteosarcoma treatment. Osteoblast proliferation is also under neural control; in particular, the activity of the N methyl D aspartate (NMDA) and alpha adrenergic 1 receptors. Antagonists to these receptors may also hypothetically play a role in osteoblastic osteosarcoma therapy. This article reviews the basic science supporting the putative roles of common, relatively safe but disparate agents ranging from caffeine and theophylline to dextromethorphan and econazote in the potential treatment of osteoblastic osteosarcoma.

AB Temporal aspects of ligand specificity have been shown to play a significant role in the case of pulsatile hormone secretion, as exemplified by parathyroid hormone (PTH) binding to its receptor (PTH1R), a G protein coupled receptor expressed on surfaces of osteoblasts and osteocytes. The latter binding reaction regulates intracellular signalling and subsequently modulates skeletal homeostasis via bone remodelling. PTH glandular secretion patterns dictate bone cellular activity. In healthy humans, 70% of PTH is secreted in a tonic fashion, whereas 30% is secreted in low amplitude and high frequency bursts occurring every 10 20 min, superimposed on the tonic secretion. Changes in the PTH secretion patterns have been associated with various bone diseases. In this paper, we analyse PTH glandular secretion patterns for healthy and pathological states and their link to bone cellular responsiveness (alpha(R)). We utilise a two state receptor ligand binding model of PTH to PTH1R together with a cellular activity function which is able to distinguish various aspects of the stimulation signal including peak dose, time of ligand exposure, and exposure period. Formulating and solving several constrained optimisation problems, we investigate the potential of pharmacological manipulation of the diseased glandular secretion and via clinical approved external PTH injections to restore healthy bone cellular responsiveness. Based on the mean experimentally reported data, our simulation results indicate cellular responsiveness in healthy subjects is sensitive to the tonic baseline stimulus and it is 28% of the computed maximum responsiveness. Simulation results for pathological cases of glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis, hyperparathyroidism, initial and steady state hypocalcemia clamp tests indicate alpha(R) values significantly larger than the healthy baseline (1.7, 2.2, 4.9 and 1.9 times, respectively). Manipulation of the pulsatile glandular secretion pattern, while keeping the mean PTH concentration constant, allowed restoration of healthy baseline values from these catabolic bone diseases. Conversely, PTH glandular diseases that led to maximum bone cellular responsiveness below the healthy baseline value can't be restored to baseline via glandular manipulation. However, external PTH injections allowed restoration of these latter cases.

AB Regenerative medicine refers to the possibility of replacing aged/damaged cells with genetically similar young and functional cells to restore or establish normal function. Kartogenin (KGN), a small heterocyclic, drug like compound was discovered in 2012, which is strongly associated with regenerative medicine. KGN has been applied in many regenerative fields, including cartilage regeneration and protection, tendon bone healing, wound healing, and limb development. KGN could facilitate cartilage repair, promote formation of cartilage like transition zone in tendon bone junctions, stimulate collagen synthesis for wound healing, and regulate limb development in a coordinated manner. Considering the related mechanism, filamin A/CBF/RUNX1, Ihh, and TGF/Smad pathways have been reported to involve KGN. Therefore, KGN is proven a promising agent in regenerative medicine; however, studies conducted on the effect of KGN are limited to date and not convictive for long term use. Further studies are recommended to explore the long term effect and potential molecular mechanisms of KGN. Our investigations may motivate researchers to expand its applications in different forms and fields.

AB The decreasing number and reduced osteogenic differentiation capacity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the excessive proliferation of osteoclasts in periodontal defects lead to difficulty in periodontal regeneration. Growth factors have powerful impacts on stem cell recruitment and differentiation, and alendronate (ALN) is a potent inhibitor of osteoclasts, which exert precise roles in periodontal regeneration. However, they are all hydrophilic molecules, typically delivered in a soluble format and rapidly released at supraphysiologic doses, which have side effects. In this study, we developed a simple and robust approach to the sustained release of bioactive molecules for endogenous periodontal regeneration. The release system was based on partially demineralized dentin matrix (PDD) in which growth factors were entrapped and hydroxyapatite was only distributed in the interior of the dentin tubules. ALN was then anchored inside PDD, after which PDD ALN was obtained. PDD ALN could stably release physiological concentrations of BMP 2, VEGFA, and ALN in a sustained manner. This delivery system exhibits three synergistic effects on bone microenvironment: i) PDD ALN enhanced MSC migration and their osteogenic differentiation related to the BMP/Smad signaling pathway; ii) PDD ALN inhibited the formation and function of osteoclasts related to the NF kappa B, p38, and ERK1/2 signaling pathways; iii) PDD ALN enhanced angiogenesis in umbilical vein endothelial cells related to the VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling networks. PDD ALN ultimately promoted periodontal regeneration in a rat model. This simple and low cost technology provides a new idea for constructing an efficient delivery system and has promising prospects for the repair of defects in bone metabolic diseases.

AB Background: Treatment of giant cell tumour of bone (GCTB) of the distal radius/ulna poses a surgical challenge, as complex reconstructive surgery may be required. This study evaluates the clinical, radiological and pathological findings in five cases of GCTB of the distal forearm where a 3 month course of denosumab was given prior to surgery.
   Methods: Patients with biopsy proven distal forearm GCTB, treated for 3 months with denosumab, followed by salvage surgery (curettage and cementation) were included. Wrist pain and function were assessed using the modified Mayo Wrist Score (MMWS). Plain radiographs, MRI and PET/CT were performed pre treatment and 2 months after initiation of denosumab therapy. Histological comparison was made between the original biopsy and surgical curettage specimens.
   Results: Five patients with an average age of 25 years were included in the study. Improvement in wrist pain and function was seen in all patients with the average MMWS increasing from 30 pre treatment to 85 at 3 months. Plain radiographs demonstrated marginal sclerosis in all cases with reconstitution of cortical and subarticular bone by 2 months; internal matrix sclerosis and osseous consolidation was more variable. Increased tumour heterogeneity and low signal were observed on T2 weighted MR images. PET/CT revealed a decrease in average SUV from 14.8 pre treatment to 4.7 at 2 months. Histology showed disappearance of osteoclasts and increased fibro osseous tissue. Denosumab treatment has the potential to facilitate salvage surgery, thus avoiding bone resection and graft reconstruction. A good outcome was achieved apart from local recurrence in one case. Follow up ranged from 17 to 54 months.
   Conclusion: Distal forearm GCTB responds clinically, radiologically and histologically to a short course of pre operative denosumab therapy, which has the potential to facilitate salvage surgery.

AB Background and PurposeAutografts are used for bone reconstruction in regenerative medicine including oral and maxillofacial surgery. Bone grafts release paracrine signals that can reach mesenchymal cells at defect sites. The impact of the paracrine signals on osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells has remained unclear.
   Material and MethodsOsteogenesis, adipogenesis, and chondrogenesis were studied with murine ST2 osteoblast progenitors, 3T3 L1 preadipocytes, and ATDC5 prechondrogenic cells, respectively. Primary periodontal fibroblasts from the gingiva, from the periodontal ligament, and from bone were also included in the analysis. Cells were exposed to bone conditioned medium (BCM) that was prepared from porcine cortical bone chips.
   ResultsBCM inhibited osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of ST2 and 3T3 L1 cells, respectively, as shown by histological staining and gene expression. No substantial changes in the expression of chondrogenic genes were observed in ATDC5 cells. Primary periodontal fibroblasts also showed a robust decrease in alkaline phosphatase and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR) expression when exposed to BCM. BCM also increased collagen type 10 expression. Pharmacologic blocking of transforming growth factor (TGF)  receptor type I kinase with SB431542 and the smad 3 inhibitor SIS3 at least partially reversed the effect of BCM on PPAR and collagen type 10 expression. In support of BCM having TGF  activity, the respective target genes were increasingly expressed in periodontal fibroblasts.
   ConclusionsThe present work is a pioneer study on the paracrine activity of bone grafts. The findings suggest that cortical bone chips release soluble signals that can modulate differentiation of mesenchymal cells in vitro at least partially involving TGF  signaling.

AB Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer; a primary driver of this high level of morbidity is the propensity of melanoma cells to metastasize. When malignant tumours develop distant metastatic lesions the new local tissue niche is known to impact on the biology of the cancer cells. However, little is known about how different metastatic tissue sites impact on frontline targeted therapies. Intriguingly, melanoma bone lesions have significantly lower response to BRAF or MEK inhibitor therapies. Here, we have investigated how the cellular niche of the bone can support melanoma cells by stimulating growth and survival via paracrine signalling between osteoblasts and cancer cells. Melanoma cells can enhance the differentiation of osteoblasts leading to increased production of secreted ligands, including RANKL. Differentiated osteoblasts in turn can support melanoma cell proliferation and survival via the secretion of RANKL that elevates the levels of the transcription factor MITF, even in the presence of BRAF inhibitor. By blocking RANKL signalling, either via neutralizing antibodies, genetic alterations or the RANKL receptor inhibitor SPD304, the survival advantage provided by osteoblasts could be overcome.

AB Objective To investigate the changes in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, namely, C C motif ligand (CCL) 2 and CCL7, in postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) and to develop a new drug, bindarit (Bnd), for PMOP in an ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model. Methods Bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) from the femurs of five women with PMOP and five premenopausal women without osteoporosis were detected by RNA sequencing. BMMs from mice were differentiated into osteoclasts and treated with a synthetic inhibitor of CCL2 and CCL7, Bnd, or 17 beta estradiol (E 2). Mouse BMMs were differentiated into osteoclasts with or without Bnd for 7 days and analyzed by RNA sequencing. Osteoblasts of mice were induced to undergo osteoblastogenesis and treated with Bnd. OVX mice were treated with E 2 or Bnd after surgery. The protein and mRNA expression of CCL2 and CCL7 was detected using immunostaining and qPCR, respectively, in OVX and aged mice and in cells cultured in vitro. Osteoclast formation was detected using a tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) assay in vitro and in vivo. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osteocalcin (OCN) were detected using immunostaining to evaluate osteogenesis. Microcomputed tomography was conducted to analyze trabecular bone parameters, the structure model index, bone mineral density and other variables. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) signaling pathway related protein phosphorylation of IKK alpha/beta (p IKK alpha/beta) and p NF kappa B p65 was examined using western blotting. Results CCL2, CCL7 and their receptor of C C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), and the NF kappa B signaling pathway, were significantly increased in women with PMOP. CCL2 and CCL7 protein and mRNA expression was increased in OVX mice and aged female mice, but the increases were attenuated by E 2 and Bnd. E 2 and Bnd effectively inhibited osteoclastogenesis and the protein expression of CCL2 and CCL7 both in vitro and in vivo and reduced bone loss in OVX mice. Bnd did not affect the mineralization of osteoblasts directly in vitro but reduced bone turnover in vivo. p IKK alpha/beta and p NF kappa B p65 levels were increased in BMMs of mice after differentiation into osteoclasts but were significantly decreased by Bnd. Conclusion The proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines CCL2, CCL7 and CCR2 were correlated with PMOP. Bnd attenuated the increases in CCL2 and CCL7 levels to affect osteoporosis in OVX mice via the NF kappa B signaling pathway. Thus, Bnd may be useful as a new therapeutic for the prevention of PMOP.

However, little is known about the role of autophagy in mechanical stimulation influenced osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. In the present study, we first demonstrated that autophagy activation was essential for cyclic mechanical stretching promoted osteoblast differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. To explore the in vivo role of autophagy in osteoblast differentiation, the hindlimb unloading induced disuse osteoporosis model was used. Compared to the normal controls, hindlimb unloading led to abundant bone loss as well as lessened autophagy activation of osteoblasts. However, the activation of autophagy by ULK1 overexpression or in the presence of rapamycin significantly increased osteoblast differentiation activity and restored the bone volume. The findings implicate autophagy as a novel mechanosensitive pathway that regulates osteoblast differentiation. The pharmacological activation of autophagy may be an interesting approach for the prevention and treatment of disuse osteoporosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has beneficial effects on avascular necrosis of femoral head (ANFH), but its mechanism of action is still unclear. We investigated if HBOT upregulates serum osteoprotegerin (OPG) and/ or inhibits osteoclast activation. 23 patients with unilateral ANFH at stage I, II and III consented to the study: the patients received standard HBOT. Serum OPG levels were obtained at the beginning of HBOT (T0), after 15 sessions (T1), 30 sessions (T2), after a 30 day break (T3), and after 60 sessions (T4). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained at T0 and about one year from the end of HBO treatments. Lesion size was compared between pre and post HBOT. 19 patients completed the study. HBOT reduced pain symptoms in all patients. HBOT significantly reduced lesion size in all stage I and II patients and in 2 of 11 stage III patients. HBOT increased serum OPG levels but receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) levels did not change.

AB Diabetes and cancer are both serious health problems worldwide and can lead to a significant burden on society with high incidence. Studies show that diabetes, which may be the reason of cancer metastasis, can increase cancer incidence and mortality. Bone is one of the most preferential metastatic target sites for cancers. Studies also indicate that OPG and RANKL which regulate bone reabsorption play significant roles in the process of bone tumor metastasis. In addition, metformin as a commonly used medicine for type 2 diabetes is a negative regulator of RANKL and inhibits the differentiation of osteoclasts. We present a hypothesis that metformin serves an inhibitory effect on bone metastasis of cancer via OPG/RANKL/RANK system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The seed of Cuscutae Semen has been used as a functional food to prevent osteoporosis and aging, and improve sexual function in Traditional Chinese Medicine. However, there is a little report on its beneficial effects on osteoporosis. The purpose of our study was to explore whether Cuscutae Semen polysaccharide (CSP) could prevent osteoporosis induced by estrogen deficiency in the ovariectomized rat model. The preventive effect of CSP was assessed using the ovariectomized (OVX) rat model by treatment with vehicle or CSP for 12 weeks. Serum indexes related to osteogenesis were measured using ELISA kits. The underlying mechanism of action of CSP was evaluated by qRT PCR. The findings showed that CSP exerted bone protective effects via the increase of bone mass, BMD, IGF, TGF beta, osteocalcin, and osteoprotegerin, and the decrease of TRAP and CTX levels in estrogen deficiency induced osteoporosis, which is mediated by up regulating the expression levels of Osterix, BMP 2, Runx2, and Smad5 and down regulating the expression levels of TRAP, NFATc1, c Fos, and cathepsin K. These findings suggested that CSP exhibited the preventive effects in the estrogen deficiency induced osteoporosis via promoting bone formation and inhibiting bone resorption. Therefore, CSP may be developed as a promising agent for the prevention of estrogen deficiency induced osteoporosis.

AB Modern pharmacological studies revealed that Celastrol exhibits anti inflammation, anti bacteria, anti virus, anti fertility, insect resistance functions and has been used for the treatment of rheumatism, rheumatoid arthritis, blood diseases, skin diseases and agricultural insecticide. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of Celastrol on glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis (GIOP) and the underlying molecular mechanisms. The findings of the current study revealed that Celastrol reduced body weight, urine calcium/creatinine, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase 5b, C terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, and induced osteocalcin in GIOP rats. In addition, alkaline phosphatase, triiodothyronine receptor auxiliary protein and cathepsin K mRNA expression levels were effectively suppressed, and osteocalcin, bone morphogenetic protein 2, type I collagen and runt related transcription factor 2 mRNA expression levels were effectively induced in osteoporosis rats treated with Celastrol. Celastrol inhibited prostaglandin E2 and caspase 3 protein expression levels, and induced phosphoinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated protein kinase B (AKT) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 phosphorylation, Wnt and beta catenin protein expression in GIOP rats. The present study demonstrated that Celastrol may inhibit GIOP in rats via the PI3K/AKT and Wnt signaling pathways.

AB Osteoporosis is a prevalent systemic metabolic disease in modern society, in which patients often suffer from bone loss due to over activation of osteoclasts. Currently, amelioration of bone loss through mod ulation of osteoclast activity is a major therapeutic strategy. Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhib itor CGK733 (CG) was reported to have a sensitizing impact in treating malignancies. However, its effect on osteoporosis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of CG on osteoclast differen tiation and function, as well as the therapeutic effects of CG on osteoporosis. Our study found that CG inhibits osteoclast differentiation and function. We further found that CG inhibits the activation of NFATc1 and ultimately osteoclast formation by inhibiting RANKL mediated Ca2+ oscillation and the NF KB/MAPK signaling pathway. Next, we constructed an ovariectomized mouse model and demonstrated that CG improved bone loss in ovariectomized mice. Therefore, CG may be a potential drug for the pre vention and treatment of osteoporosis.

AB Alendronate (Alen) modified hydroxyapatite (HAp) nanoparticles with multilayers of poly(allylamine) (PAA) and alginate (ALG) were fabricated for bone specific dual delivery of drug and mineral. Negatively charged HAp nanoparticles were coated with three layers of PAA and ALG using a layer by layer (LbL) method and then conjugated with Alen at the outmost layer of the LbL coated HAp nanoparticles via carbodiimide chemistry. Alen modified HAp nanoparticles had a spherical morphology and an average size of 61.5 nm. The superior adsorption property of the Alen modified HAp nanoparticles was quantitatively confirmed using tricalcium phosphate disks as a bone model, compared to HAp nanoparticles. Cell culture assays revealed a higher proliferation rate and alkaline phosphatase activity of osteoblasts treated with the Alen modified HAp nanoparticles.

AB Substrate topographical features induce osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs), but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. As microRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in osteogenesis and bone regeneration, it would be meaningful to elucidate the roles of miRNAs in the intracellular signaling cascade of topographical cue induced osteogenic differentiation. In this study, the miRNA expression profile of the topographical feature induced osteogenic differentiation group is different from that of the chemical factors induced osteogenic differentiation group. miR 193a 3p is sensitive to substrate topographical features and its downregulation enhances osteogenic differentiation only in the absence of osteogenesis inducing medium. Also, substrate topographical features specifically activate a nonclassical osteogenetic pathway the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Loss  and gain of function experiments demonstrate that miR 193a 3p regulates the MAPK pathway by targeting the MAP3k3 gene. In conclusion, this data indicates that different osteogenic lineage related intracellular signaling cascades are triggered in BMSCs subjected to biophysical or chemical stimulation. Moreover, the miR 193a 3p MAP3k3 signaling axis plays a pivotal role in the transduction of biophysical cues from the substrate to regulate the osteogenic lineage specification of BMSCs, and hence may be a promising molecular target for bone regenerative therapies.

AB Disulfiram (DSF), a cysteine modifying compound, has long been clinically employed for the treatment of alcohol addiction. Mechanistically, DSF acts as a modulator of MAPK and NF kappa B pathways signaling pathways. While these pathways are crucial for osteoclast (OC) differentiation, the potential influence of DSF on OC formation and function has not been directly assessed. Here, we explore the pharmacological effects of DSF on OC differentiation, activity and the modulation of osteoclastogenic signaling cascades. We first analyzed cytotoxicity of DSF on bone marrow monocytes isolated from C57BL/6J mice. Upon the establishment of optimal dosage, we conducted osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption assays in the presence or absence of DSF treatment. Luciferase assays in RAW264.7 cells were used to examine the effects of DSF on major transcription factors activation. Western blot, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, intracellular acidification and proton influx assays were employed to further dissect the underlying mechanism. DSF treatment dose dependently inhibited both mouse and human osteoclastogenesis, especially at early stages of differentiation. This inhibition correlated with a decrease in the expression of key osteoclastic marker genes including CtsK, TRAP, DC STAMP and Atp6v0d2 as well as a reduction in bone resorption in vitro. Suppression of OC differentiation was found to be due, at least in part, to the blockade of several key receptor activators of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) signaling pathways including ERK, NF kappa B and NFATc1. On the other hand, DSF failed to suppress intracellular acidification and proton influx in mouse and human osteoclasts using acridine orange quenching and microsome based proton transport assays. Our findings indicate that DSF attenuates OC differentiation via the collective suppression of several key RANKL mediated signaling cascades, thus making it an attractive agent for the treatment of OC mediated disorders.

AB Osteoporosis is the most common chronic metabolic bone disease, and the prevalence of osteoporotic fractures is rapidly increasing with the aging population. While bisphosphonates can reduce bone loss and risk of fracture, these drugs are systemic, rely on long term use, and patient compliance is low. Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP 2) is an FDA approved protein that can offer a more targeted therapeutic than systemic treatments. DWIVA is a peptide sequence corresponding to the wrist epitope of BMP 2, and DWIVA functionalized hydrogels feature osteoinductive propertiesin vitro and in vivo. This study reports that self forming DWIVA functionalized hydrogels injected into the intramedullary canal of rat femurs induce a local increase in trabecular bone in as little as 2 weeks. Increases in bone volume, trabecular thickness, and trabeculae count from DWIVA laden hydrogels persist for at least 4 weeks, and the inclusion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) significantly enhances the development of mineralized bone. Histological analysis of decalcified femurs also shows that hydrogel injections containing DWIVA peptide and MSCs stimulate unmineralized bone tissue formation and induce an increased count of osteoblasts and osteoclasts at the injection site after 4 weeks. Overall, the MSC laden DWIVA peptide functionalized hydrogels presented rapidly induce targeted bone formation and have the potential to form nascent bone within bones in jeopardy of an osteoporotic fracture such as the femur.

AB We describe a new model of myeloma bone disease in which beta(2)m NOD/SCID mice injected with KMS 12 BM cells develop medullary disease after tail vein administration. Micro computed tomography analysis demonstrated significant bone loss in the tibiae and vertebrae of diseased animals compared to controls, with loss of cortical bone ( P < 0.01), as well as trabecular bone volume, thickness and number ( P < 0.05 for all). Bone marrow of diseased animals demonstrated an increase in osteoclasts ( P < 0.01) and reduction in osteoblasts (P < 0.01) compared to control animals. Both bone loss and osteoclast increase correlated with the degree of disease involvement. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were lentivirally transduced to express human osteoprotegerin (hOPG). Systemic administration of OPG expressing MSC reduced osteoclast activation ( P < 0.01) and trabecular bone loss in the vertebrae (P < 0.05) and tibiae of diseased animals, to levels comparable to non diseased controls. Because of its predominantly medullary involvement and quantifiable parameters of bone disease, the KMS 12 BM xenogeneic model provides unique opportunities to test therapies targeted at the bone marrow microenvironment.

AB The molecular mechanisms underlying bone destruction by invading oral cancer are not well understood. Using IHC, we demonstrated that receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B Ligand (RANKL) positive fibroblasts and cancer cells were Located at sites of bone invasion in human oral cancers. HSC3 and HO 1 N 1, human oral cancer cell Lines, expressed RANKL and stimulated Rankl expression in the UAMS 32 murine osteoblastic cell Line. We discriminated the roles of RANKL synthesized by stromal cells and cancer cells in cancer associated bone resorption by using species specific RANKL antibodies against murine RANKL and human RANKL, respectively. Osteoclastogenesis induced by the conditioned medium of HSC3 and HO 1 N 1 cells in a co culture of murine bone marrow cells and UAMS 32 cells was inhibited by the addition of antibodies against either mouse or human RANKL. HSC3 induced bone destruction was greatly inhibited by the administration of anti mouse RANKL antibody in a xenograft model. HO 1 N 1 induced bone destruction was inhibited by the administration of either anti mouse or anti human RANKL antibody. Bone destruction induced by the transplantation of human RANKL overexpressing cells (HSC3 R2) was greatly inhibited by the injection of anti human RANKL antibody. The present study revealed that RANKL produced by both stomal and cancer cells is involved in oral cancer induced osteoclastic bone resorption. These results provide important information for understanding the cellular and molecular basis of cancer associated bone destruction and the mechanism of action underlying RANKL antibody (denosumab) therapy.

AB Background Aspirin is a commonly used antipyretic, analgesic, and anti inflammatory drug. Numerous researches have demonstrated that aspirin exerts multiple biological effects on bone metabolism. However, its spatiotemporal roles remain controversial according to the specific therapeutic doses used for different clinical conditions, and the detailed mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Hence, in the present study, we aimed to identify the dual effects of different aspirin dosages on osteoclastic activity and osteoblastic bone formation in vitro and in vivo.
   Methods The effects of varying doses of aspirin on osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation were evaluated in vitro. The underlying molecular mechanisms were detected using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and immunofluorescence techniques. An ovariectomized rat osteoporosis model was used to assess the bone protective effects of aspirin in vivo.
   Results Aspirin dose dependently suppressed RANKL induced osteoclasts differentiation and bone resorption in vitro and reduced the expression of osteoclastic marker genes, including TRAP, cathepsin K, and CTR. Further molecular analysis revealed that aspirin impaired the RANKL induced NF kappa B and MAPK signaling pathways and prevented the nuclear translocation of the NF kappa B p65 subunit. Low dose aspirin promoted osteogenic differentiation, whereas these effects were attenuated when high dose aspirin was administered. Both low and high doses of aspirin prevented bone loss in an ovariectomized rat osteoporosis model in vivo.
   Conclusion Aspirin inhibits RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis and promotes osteogenesis in a dual regulatory manner, thus preventing bone loss in vivo. These data indicate that aspirin has potential applications in the prevention and treatment of osteopenia.

AB Background: Most primary and metastatic bone tumors demonstrate increased osteoclast activity and bone resorption. Current treatment is based on a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Severe side effects are associated with chemotherapy due to use of high dosage and nonspecific uptake. Bisphosphonates have a strong affinity to Ca2+ ions and are widely used in the treatment of bone disorders.
   Results: We have engineered a unique biodegradable bisphosphonate nanoparticle (NPs) bearing two functional surface groups: (1) primary amine groups for covalent attachment of a dye/drug (e.g. NIR dye Cy 7 or doxorubicin); (2) bisphosphonate groups for targeting and chelation to bone hydroxyapatite. In addition, these engineered NPs contain high polyethyleneglycol (PEG) concentration in order to increase their blood half life time. In vitro experiments on Saos 2 human osteosarcoma cell line, demonstrated that at a tenth of the concentration, doxorubicin conjugated bisphosphonate NPs achieved a similar uptake to free doxorubicin. In vivo targeting experiments using the NIR fluorescence bisphosphonate NPs on both Soas 2 human osteosarcoma xenograft mouse model and orthotopic bone metastases mCherry labeled 4T1 breast cancer mouse model confirmed specific targeting. In addition, therapeutic in vivo experiments using doxorubicin conjugated bisphosphonate NPs demonstrated a 40% greater inhibition of tumor growth in Saos 2 human osteosarcoma xenograft mouse model when compared to free doxorubicin.
   Conclusions: In this research we have shown the potential use of doxorubicin conjugated BP NPs for the targeting and treatment of primary and metastatic bone tumors. The targeted delivery of doxorubicin to the tumor significantly increased the efficacy of the anti cancer drug, thus enabling the effective use of a lower concentration of doxorubicin. Furthermore, the targeting ability of the BP NPs in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model reinforced our findings that these BP NPs have the potential to be used for the treatment of primary and metastatic bone cancer.

TI Stimulation of Host Bone Marrow Stromal Cells by Sympathetic Nerves

AB Bone and lung metastases are responsible for the majority of deaths in patients with breast cancer. Following treatment of the primary cancer, emotional and psychosocial factors within this population precipitate time to recurrence and death, however the underlying mechanism(s) remain unclear. Using a mouse model of bone metastasis, we provide experimental evidence that activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which is one of many pathophysiological consequences of severe stress and depression, promotes MDA 231 breast cancer cell colonization of bone via a neurohormonal effect on the host bone marrow stroma. We demonstrate that induction of RANKL expression in bone marrow osteoblasts, following beta 2AR stimulation, increases the migration of metastatic MDA 231 cells in vitro, independently of SDF1 CXCR4 signaling. We also show that the stimulatory effect of endogenous (chronic stress) or pharmacologic sympathetic activation on breast cancer bone metastasis in vivo can be blocked with the beta blocker propranolol, and by knockdown of RANK expression in MDA 231 cells. These findings indicate that RANKL promotes breast cancer cell metastasis to bone via its pro migratory effect on breast cancer cells, independently of its effect on bone turnover. The emerging clinical implication, supported by recent epidemiological studies, is that beta AR blockers and drugs interfering with RANKL signaling, such as Denosumab, could increase patient survival if used as adjuvant therapy to inhibit both the early colonization of bone by metastatic breast cancer cells and the initiation of the "vicious cycle" of bone destruction induced by these cells.

AB Targeting drugs to their desired site of action can increase their safety and efficacy. Bisphosphonates are prototypical examples of drugs targeted to bone. However, bisphosphonate bone affinity is often considered too strong and cannot be significantly modulated without losing activity on the enzymatic target, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS). Furthermore, bisphosphonate bone affinity comes at the expense of very low and variable oral bioavailability. FPPS inhibitors were developed with a monophosphonate as a bone affinity tag that confers moderate affinity to bone, which can furthermore be tuned to the desired level, and the relationship between structure and bone affinity was evaluated by using an NMR based bone binding assay. The concept of targeting drugs to bone with moderate affinity, while retaining oral bioavailability, has broad application to a variety of other bone targeted drugs.

AB The incidence and morbidity of diabetes osteoporosis (DOP) are increasing with each passing year. Patients with DOP have a higher risk of bone fracture and poor healing of bone defects, which make a poor quality of their life. Bone tissue engineering based on autologous adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) transplantation develops as an effective technique to achieve tissue regeneration for patients with bone defects. With the purpose of promoting auto ASCs transplantation, this research project explored the effect of metformin on the osteogenic differentiation of ASCs under a high glucose culture environment. In this study, we found that 40 mM high glucose inhibited the physiological function of ASCs, including cell proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation. Indicators of osteogenic differentiation were all downregulated by 40 mM high glucose, including alkaline phosphatase activity, runt related transcription factor 2, and osteopontin gene expression, and Wnt signaling pathway. At the same time, the cell autophagy makers BECLIN1 and microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3 I/II) were decreased. While 0.1 mM metformin upregulated the expression of BECLIN1 and LC3 I/II gene and inhibited the expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and GSK3 beta, it contributed to reverse the osteogenesis inhibition of ASCs caused by high glucose. When 3 methyladenine was used to block the activity of metformin, metformin could not exert its protective effect on ASCs. All the findings elaborated the regulatory mechanism of metformin in the high glucose microenvironment to protect the osteogenic differentiation ability of ASCs. Metformin plays an active role in promoting the osteogenic differentiation of ASCs with DOP, and it may contribute to the application of ASCs transplantation for bone regeneration in DOP.</p>

AB The imbalance of bone homeostasis is the root cause of osteoporosis. However current therapeutic approaches mainly focus on either anabolic or catabolic pathways, which often fail to turn the imbalanced bone metabolism around. Herein we reported that a SIRT 1 agonist mediated molecular therapeutic strategy to reverse the imbalance in bone homeostasis by simultaneously regulating osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis via locally sustained release of SRT2104 from mineral coated acellular matrix microparticles. Immobilization of SRT2104 on mineral coating (MAM/SRT) harnessing their electrostatic interactions resulted in sustained release of SIRT 1 agonist for over 30 days. MAM/SRT not only enhanced osteogenic differentiation and mineralization, but also attenuated the formation and function of excessive osteoclasts via integrating multiple vital upstream signals (beta catenin, FoxOs, Runx2, NFATc1, etc.) in vitro. Osteoporosis animal model also validated that it accelerated osteoporotic bone healing and improved osseointegration of the surrounding bone. Overall, our work proposes a promising strategy to treat osteoporotic bone defects by reversing the imbalance in bone homeostasis using designated small molecule drug delivery systems.

AB BackgroundPD 1 inhibition (PD 1i) is the standard of care in melanoma and other malignancies. In patients with bone metastases of solid tumors, the monoclonal antibody denosumab directed against RANKL is approved for the prevention of skeletal related events. However, RANKL is not only relevant in osteoclastogenesis, but also has immunological effects. Hence, we aimed at investigating, whether the combination of PD 1i and denosumab produces synergistic effects in metastatic melanoma treatment.MethodsWe retrospectively collected and analyzed clinical data of metastatic melanoma patients with bone metastases, who received PD 1i and denosumab therapy.Results29 patients were identified with a median age of 60.7years: 20 were male and 9 were female. 20 patients (69%) were in stage IV M1c and 9 (31%) in stage IV M1d; 52% had an increased serum LDH. 24 patients (83%) received PD 1i as first line therapy and five patients (17%) as second  or third line therapy. 13 patients received the triple combination nivolumab, ipilimumab and denosumab (N+I+D), 16 patients received PD 1i and denosumab (PD 1i+D). Within a median follow up time of 19.8months, 17 patients progressed with a median time to progression of 6months. The objective response rate was 54% in the N+I+D group and 50% in the PD 1i+D group. Recalcification of bone metastases was radiologically observed in 18 (62%) patients. No unexpected treatment related adverse events emerged.ConclusionsThe combination therapy of metastatic melanoma with PD 1i and denosumab was feasible without unexpected safety issues and showed a promising efficacy signal. Further investigation in prospective studies is needed.

AB Salidroside (SAL) is one of main active components of Rhodiola rosea L and possesses diverse pharmacological effects. However, the direct role of SAL in bone metabolism remains elusive. In this study, effects of SAL on osteoblast differentiation of murine pluripotent mesenchymal cell line C3H10T1/2 and osteoblastic cell line MC3T3 E1 were examined. We first identified SAL as a potential BMP2 activator in a cell based screening assay. SAL (0.5 10 mu M) could slightly promote the proliferation and greatly increase the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in both cells. Furthermore, SAL increased the mRNA expressions of osteoblast marker genes in either C3H10T1/2 or MC3T3 E1 cells after treatment for different time. Moreover, the mineralization of C3H10T1/2 cells assayed by Alizarin red S staining was dose dependently increased by SAL Mechanistically, SAL increased the mRNA level of genes involved in the regulation of BMP signaling pathway, including BMP2, BMP6 and BMP7 and enhanced the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and ERK1/2. The osteogenic effect of SAL was abolished by BMP antagonist noggin or by BMP receptor kinase inhibitor dorsomorphin. Further in vivo study demonstrated that SAL reversed bone loss in ovariectomized rats. Collectively, our findings indicate that SAL regulates bone metabolism through BMP signaling pathway.

AB Patients with advanced breast cancer often develop bone metastases. Treatment is limited to palliative care. Parathyroid hormone (PTH)/parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP) antagonists for bone metastases failed clinically due to short half life and inadequate concentration in bone. We synthesized two novel PTHrP antagonists fused to an inert bacterial collagen binding domain (CBD) that directs drugs to bone. PTH(7 33) CBD is an N terminal truncated PTHrP antagonist. [W2]PTH(1 33) CBD is an PTHrP inverse agonist. The aim of this study was to assess PTH(7 33) CBD to reduce breast cancer bone metastases and prevent osteolytic destruction in mice and to assess both drugs for apoptosis of breast cancer cells in vitro and inhibition of PTH receptor (PTHR1). PTH(7 33) CBD (1000 mu g/kg, subcutaneous) or vehicle was administered 24 h prior to MDA MB 231 breast cancer cell inoculation into the tibia marrow. Weekly tumor burden and bone density were measured. Pharmacokinetic analysis of PTH(7 33) CBD in rat serum was evaluated. Drug effect on cAMP accumulation in SaOS 2 osteosarcoma cells and apoptosis of MDA MB 231 cells was assessed. PTH(7 33) CBD reduced MDA MB 231 tumor burden and osteolytic destruction in mice 4 5 weeks post treatment. PTH(7 33) CBD (1000 mu g/kg i.v. and subcutaneous) in rats was rapidly absorbed with peak concentration 5 min and terminal half life 3 h. Bioavailability by the subcutaneous route was 43% relative to the i.v. route. PTH(7 33) CBD was detected only on rat periosteal bone surfaces that stained positive for collagen 1. PTH(7 33) CBD and [W2]PTH(1 33) CBD (10( 8)M) blocked basal and PTH agonist induced cAMP accumulation in SaOS 2 osteosarcoma cells. Both drugs induced PTHR1 dependent apoptosis of MDA MB 231 cells in vitro. Novel bone targeted PTHrP antagonists represent a new paradigm for treatment of breast cancer bone metastases.

AB Although active vitamin D drugs have been used for the treatment of osteoporosis, how the vitamin D receptor (VDR) regulates bone cell function remains largely unknown. Using osteoprotegerin deficient mice, which exhibit severe osteoporosis due to excessive receptor activator of NF kappa B hgand/receptor activator of NF kappa B (RANKL/RANK) stimulation, we show herein that oral treatment of these mice with 1 alpha,25 dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [1 alpha,2S(OH)(2)D 3] inhibited bone resorption and prevented bone loss, suggesting that VDR counters RANKL/RANK signaling. In M CSF dependent osteoclast precursor cells isolated from mouse bone marrow, 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D 3 potently and dose dependently inhibited their differentiation into multinucleate osteoclasts induced by RANKL. Among signaling molecules downstream of RANK, 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D 3 inhibited the induction of c Fos protein after RANKL stimulation, and retroviral expression of c Fos protein abrogated the suppressive effect of 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D 3 on osteoclast development. By screening vitamin D analogs based on their c Fos suppressing activity, we identified a new analog, named DD281, that inhibited bone resorption and prevented bone loss in ovariectomized mice, more potently than 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D 3, with similar levels of calcium absorption. Thus, c Fos protein is an important target of the skeletal action of VDR based drugs, and DD281 is a bone selective analog that may be useful for the treatment of bone diseases with excessive osteoclastic activity.

AB Phosphonates based agents are well known bone seeking radiopharmaceuticals with application in detection and therapy. With higher sensitivity and resolution offered by Positron Emission Tomography (PET), tracers based on this technique are gaining huge attention. Ga 68 based generator and radiotracers render independence from the on site cyclotron. We report the development of Ga 68 labeled DOTA based bismacrocyclic phosphonate derivative, for bone PET imaging. The synthesis and characterization of (68)GaDO3P AME DO3P was carried out in 95% purity. The radiotracer displayed high stability and low binding affinity (< 3%) to blood serum. High in vitro binding affinity were observed for synthetic hydroxyapatite, SAOS 2, osteoclast and osteoblast cells. In vivo pharmacokinetics revealed fast washout with biphasic release pattern. The deposition of radiotracer in osseous tissues was high (Bone/Muscle ratio:18), as studied from the biodistribution studies. In vivo PET/CT and biodistribution analyses revealed the ability of Ga 68 DO3P AME DO3P to target and accumulate in bone, thus displaying its potential as a PET bone imaging agent.

AB Teriparatide, human PTH (1 34), a new therapy for osteoporosis, elicits markedly different skeletal responses depending on the treatment regimen. In order to understand potential mechanisms for this dichotomy, the present investigation utilized microarrays to delineate the genes and pathways that are regulated by intermittent (Subcutaneous injection of 80 mu g/kg/day) and continuous (subcutaneous infusion of 40 mu g/kg/day by osmotic mini pump) PTH (1 34) for 1 week in 6 month old female rats. The effect of each PTH regimen was confirmed by histomorphometric analysis of the proximal tibial metaphysis, and mRNA from the distal femoral metaphysis was analyzed using an Affymetrix microarray. Both PTH paradigms co regulated 22 genes including known bone formation genes (i.e., collagens, osteocalcin, decorin, and osteonectin) and also uniquely modulated additional genes. Intermittent PTH regulated 19 additional genes while continuous treatment regulated 173 additional genes. This investigation details for the first time the broad profiling of the gene and pathway changes that occur in vivo following treatment of intermittent versus continuous PTH (1 34). These results extend previous observations of gene expression changes and reveal the in vivo regulation of BMP3 and multiple neuronal genes by PTH treatment. (c) 2005 Wiley Liss, Inc.

AB A method using osteoblast membrane chromatography coupled with liquid chromatography and time of flight mass spectrometry was developed to recognize and identify the specific active components from traditional Chinese medicines. Primary rat osteoblasts were used for the preparation of the stationary phase in the cell chromatography method. Retention components from the cell chromatography were collected and analyzed by liquid chromatography with time of flight mass spectrometry. This method was applied in screening active components from extracts of four traditional Chinese medicines. In total, 24 potentially active components with different structures were retained by osteoblast cell chromatography. There were five phenolic glucosides and one triterpenoid saponin from Curculigo orchioides Gaertn, two organic acids and ten flavonoids from Epimedium sagittatum Maxim, one phthalide compound and one organic acid from Angelica sinensis Diels, and two flavonoids and two saponins from Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge. Among those, four components (icariin, curculigoside, ferulaic acid, and timosaponin BII) were used for in vitro pharmacodynamics validation. They significantly increased the osteoblast proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, levels of bone gla protein and collagen type 1, and promoted mineralized nodule formation. The developed method was an effective screening method for finding active components from complex medicines that act on bone diseases.

TI Gossypol Promotes Bone Formation in Ovariectomy Induced Osteoporosis
   through Regulating Cell Apoptosis
SO BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL

DT Article
ID MECHANISMS
AB Osteoporosis is among the most common forms of age related diseases, especially for females, which has been a grave public health problem. Drug therapies have shown promising outcomes to promote bone formation and bone density. This study identified a novel potential drug, gossypol, for the treatment of osteoporosis. Treatments of ovariectomy induced osteoporosis mice with gossypol significantly increased serum osteocalcin and osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels; meanwhile they decreased serum RANKL levels. Microcomputed tomography (microCT) analysis showed that treatment of gossypol improved bone density and strength and decreased bone postyield displacement for both medullar and cortical bones. In vitro experiments also showed that gossypol increased cell viability in a time  and dose dependent manner. Furthermore, incubation of the osteoblast MC3T3 E1 cells with gossypol inhibited cell apoptosis through intrinsic apoptotic pathway as evidenced by the Annexin V/PI assay, TUNEL assay, biochemical analysis, and western blot assays. Moreover, the classical Wnt/beta catenin signaling pathway was found to be regulated by gossypol treatments. Inhibition of Wnt/beta catenin signaling reversed the prevention effects of gossypol in osteoporosis. Our findings provided novel clues for the treatment of osteoporosis in clinic.

TI miR 21 5p targets SKP2 to reduce osteoclastogenesis in a mouse
   model of osteoporosis
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY

ID RANKL INDUCED OSTEOCLAST; DIFFERENTIATION; ESTROGEN
AB Osteoporosis results from an imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption. Traditional drugs for treating osteoporosis are associated with serious side effects, and thus, new treatment methods are required. This study investigated the role of differentially expressed microRNAs during osteoclast differentiation and osteoclast activity during osteoarthritis as well as the associated underlying mechanisms. We used a microarray to screen microRNAs that decreased in the process of osteoclast differentiation and verified miR 21 5p to decrease significantly using RT qPCR. In follow up experiments, we found that miR 21 5p targets SKP2 to regulate osteoclast differentiation. In vivo, ovariectomized mice were used to simulate perimenopausal osteoporosis induced by estrogen deficiency, and miR 21 5p treatment inhibited bone resorption and maintained bone cortex and trabecular structure. These results suggest that miR 21 5p is a new therapeutic target for osteoporosis.

AB We recently showed that patients with primary Sjogren Syndrome (pSS) have significantly higher bone mineral density (BMD) compared to healthy controls. The majority of those patients (69%) was using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which may have favourable effects on BMD. To study the direct effects of HCQ on human MSC derived osteoblast activity. Osteoblasts were cultured from human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs). Cultures were treated with different HCQ doses (control, 1 and 5 mu g/ml). Alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium measurements were performed to evaluate osteoblast differentiation and activity, respectively. Detailed microarray analysis was performed in 5 mu g/ml HCQ treated cells and controls followed by qPCR validation. Additional cultures were performed using the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor simvastatin (SIM) to evaluate a potential mechanism of action. We showed that HCQ inhibits both MSC derived osteoblast differentiation and mineralization invitro. Microarray analysis and additional PCR validation revealed a highly significant up regulation of the cholesterol biosynthesis, lysosomal and extracellular matrix pathways in the 5 mu g/ml HCQ treated cells compared to controls. Besides, we demonstrated that 1 mu M SIM also decreases MSC derived osteoblast differentiation and mineralization compared to controls. It appears that the positive effect of HCQ on BMD cannot be explained by a stimulating effect on the MSC derived osteoblast. The discrepancy between high BMD and decreased MSC derived osteoblast function due to HCQ treatment might be caused by systemic factors that stimulate bone formation and/or local factors that reduce bone resorption, which is lacking in cell cultures.

AB Previous studies have shown that 1 alpha,25 dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1,25D) through vitamin D receptor (VDR) signalling has both catabolic and anabolic effects on osteoblast differentiation. However, the mechanism of these differential effects by 1,25D is not fully understood. In this study, mice with three different genetic backgrounds, representing a normal VDR level (wild type, WT), VDR over expression specifically in mature osteoblasts (ObVDR B6) and global VDR knockout (VDRKO), were utilised to generate primary osteoblast like cultures to further elucidate the effects of 1,25D on osteoblast differentiation. Our data confirm the importance of VDR in the late stage of osteogenic differentiation and also for the expression of factors critical for osteoblastic support of osteoclast formation. This study also demonstrates the differential effects of a pharmacological level of 1,25D (1 nM) on the expression of osteogenic differentiation markers, including Ocn and Sost, depending on the relative level of VDR. Our findings suggest that 1,25D plays an inhibitory role in matrix mineralisation, possibly through the modulation of the tissue non specific alkaline phosphatase to ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 axis, in a VDR level dependent manner. We conclude that the relative VDR level and the 1,25D availability to cells, are important co determinants for whether 1,25D plays a promoting or suppressive role in osteoblast mediated osteogenic activity.

AB Acanthopanax senticosus (Ciwujia) has broad spectrum pharmacological activities, including osteoprotective effects. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. We investigated whether Acanthopanax senticosus aqueous extract (ASAE) ameliorates ovariectomy induced bone loss in middle aged mice through inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. In vitro, ASAE significantly suppressed the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) stimulated osteoclast differentiation and formation of F actin rings by downregulating the expression of the nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), c Fos, and osteoclastogenesis related marker genes and proteins, including c Src, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin K, beta 3 integrin, and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP 9). This was achieved by inhibiting RANK signaling pathways, including p65, c Jun N terminal kinase, extracellular signal regulated kinase, and p38 in osteoclast precursors. In vivo, ASAE markedly ameliorated bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) middle aged mice. ASAE significantly inhibited the serum levels of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP 5b) and RANKL, whereas it increased those of osteocalcin, procollagen 1 N terminal peptide (P1NP), and osteoprotegerin in OVX mice. ASAE significantly inhibited the OVX induced expression of osteoclast specific proteins and genes in the femur. In conclusion, ASAE prevents ovariectomy induced bone loss in middle aged mice by inhibiting RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis through suppression of RANK signaling pathways and could be potentially used in mediated treatment of osteoclast related diseases (e.g., osteoporosis).

AB Epigenetic mechanisms control skeletal development and osteoblast differentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of the histone 3 Lys 27 (H3K27) methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in WT mice enhances osteogenesis and stimulates bone formation. However, conditional genetic loss of Ezh2 early in the mesenchymal lineage (i.e. through excision via Prrx1 promoter driven Cre) causes skeletal abnormalities due to patterning defects. Here, we addressed the key question of whether Ezh2 controls osteoblastogenesis at later developmental stages beyond patterning. We show that Ezh2 loss in committed pre osteoblasts by Cre expression via the osterix/Sp7 promoter yields phenotypically normal mice. These Ezh2 conditional knock out mice (Ezh2 cKO) have normal skull bones, clavicles, and long bones but exhibit increased bone marrow adiposity and reduced male body weight. Remarkably, in vivo Ezh2 loss results in a low trabecular bone phenotype in young mice as measured by micro computed tomography and histomorphometry. Thus, Ezh2 affects bone formation stage dependently. We further show that Ezh2 loss in bone marrow derived mesenchymal cells suppresses osteogenic differentiation and impedes cell cycle progression as reflected by decreased metabolic activity, reduced cell numbers, and changes in cell cycle distribution and in expression of cell cycle markers. RNA Seq analysis of Ezh2 cKO calvaria revealed that the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor Cdkn2a is the most prominent cell cycle target of Ezh2. Hence, genetic loss of Ezh2 in mouse pre osteoblasts inhibits osteogenesis in part by inducing cell cycle changes. Our results suggest that Ezh2 serves a bifunctional role during bone formation by suppressing osteogenic lineage commitment while simultaneously facilitating proliferative expansion of osteoprogenitor cells.

AB Endogenous glucocorticoids (GCs) support normal bone development and bone mass maintenance, whereas long term exposure to pharmacological dosages of GCs uncouples bone formation and resorption, resulting in GC induced osteoporosis (GIOP). Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) chaperoning glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling prompts us to speculate that HSP90 plays critical roles in GC mediated bone formation and GIOP. In the present study, inhibition of HSP90 activity by 17 Demethoxy 17 allyaminogeldanmycin (17 AAG) or knockdown of HSP90 expression by siRNAs attenuated dexamethasone(Dex) induced GR nuclear accumulation and transcriptional output of GR signaling, whereas overexpression of HSP90 alpha or HSP90 beta enhanced GR transactivity in C3H1OT1/2 cells. Though 17 AAG itself enhanced osteoblastic differentiation, it restored the Dex (10( 8)M)  induced and Dex(10( 6)M) negated osteoblastic differentiation in C3H10T1/2 cells and primary calvarial osteoblasts. Moreover, systemic administration of 17 AAG to mice induced not only osteoclastogenesis but also osteoblastogenesis, whereas bone formation possibly exceeded bone resorption, eventually leading to the increased bone masses. Likewise, systemic administration of 17 AAG to mice restored GC  negated osteoblastogenesis and enhanced GC induced osteoclastogenesis, similarly, 17 AAG induced bone formation possibly exceeded both 17 AAG and GC induced bone resorption, eventually resulting in rescue of GIOP. Together, the present study has revealed that inhibition of HSP90 restores GIOP through enhancing bone formation, and our findings may help to shed light on the pathogenesis of GIOP and provide targets for the therapeutic intervention of the disease.

AB Background: Herba Epimedii, a commonly used traditional herb, has been proven effective in ameliorating osteoporosis. However, the active ingredients and potential mechanism need further exploration. Objective: To screen active ingredients of Herba Epimedii with the effect of ameliorating osteoporosis and to explore their potential mechanisms. Methods: TCMSP and Swiss Target Prediction were applied to collect the ingredients of Herba Epimedii and their targets. UniProt, GeneCards, TTD, DisGeNET, and OMIM were adopted to search osteoporosis related genes. STRING and DAVID were used to perform enrichment analysis. Effects of screened ingredients were evaluated on MC3T3 E1 cells and RAW264.7 cells, respectively. Results: Eleven ingredients were screened by Network Pharmacology. They exerted a promoting effect on MC3T3 E1 cells (10 9 10 5 M). The ingredients didn't significantly affect ALP activity and osteoblastogenesis related genes. Baohuoside 1, Sagittatoside B, Chlorogenic acid, Cryptochlorogenic acid, and Neochlorogenic acid significantly increased calcium depositions. The ingredients didn't exhibit a dose dependent inhibition or promotion on RAW264.7 cells. Baohuoside 1, Sagittatoside B, Neochlorogenic acid, Cryptochlorogenic acid, Icariin, Epimedin A, Chlorogenic acid, Sagittatoside A, and Epimedin C suppressed the level of TRACP. Baohuoside 1, Sagittatoside B, Cryptochlorogenic acid, Neochlorogenic acid, Chlorogenic acid, Sagittatoside A, and Icariin decreased the number of multinucleated osteoclastic cells. Baohuoside 1, Sagittatoside B, and Cryptochlorogenic acid could significantly inhibit MMP 9 expression. Conclusion: Neochlorogenic acid, Sagittatoside B, Chlorogenic acid, and Cryptochlorogenic acid promoted MC3T3 E1 differentiation, among which Neochlorogenic acid showed significant promotion in viability, mineralization, and OPN expression. Baohuoside 1, Sagittatoside B, Cryptochlorogenic acid, Neochlorogenic acid, Chlorogenic acid, and Icariin inhibited RAW264.7 differentiation, among which Baohuoside 1 showed significant inhibition on TRACP, multinucleated osteoclastic cells number and MPP 9 expression. The mechanism might relate to the FoxO signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway.

TI Activation of Focal Adhesion Kinase Restores Simulated

AB Simulated microgravity (SMG) inhibits osteoblast differentiation (OBD) and induces bone loss via the inhibition of the Wnt/beta catenin pathway. However, the mechanism by which SMG alters the Wnt/beta catenin pathway is unknown. We previously demonstrated that SMG altered the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) regulated mTORC1, AMPK and ERK1/2 pathways, leading to the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation/metastasis and promoting cell apoptosis. To examine whether FAK similarly mediates SMG dependent changes to Wnt/beta catenin in osteoblasts, we characterized mouse MC3T3 E1 cells cultured under clinostat modeled SMG (mu g) conditions. Compared to cells cultured under ground (1 g) conditions, SMG reduces focal adhesions, alters cytoskeleton structures, and down regulates FAK, Wnt/beta catenin and Wnt/beta catenin regulated molecules. Consequently, protein 2 (BMP2), type 1 collagen (COL1), alkaline phosphatase activity and matrix mineralization are all inhibited. In the mouse hindlimb unloading (HU) model, SMG affected tibial trabecular bone loss is significantly reduced, according to histological and micro computed tomography analyses. Interestingly, the FAK activator, cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1), significantly suppresses all of the SMG induced alterations in MC3T3 E1 cells and the HU model. Therefore, our data demonstrate the critical role of FAK in the SMG induced inhibition of OBD and bone loss via the Wnt/beta catenin pathway, offering FAK signaling as a new therapeutic target not only for astronauts at risk of OBD inhibition and bone loss, but also osteoporotic patients.

AB Bone is a connective tissue composed of many cell types, including osteoblasts. How bones acquire their unique size and shape during development remains poorly understood. Herein we investigated the molecular and cellular mechanisms of bone morphogenesis in the zebrafish scale by using transgenic lines to enable visualization of specific types of osteoblasts. We demonstrate that the zebrafish scale contains three distinct types of osteoblasts: (i) a monolayer of central osteoblasts along the inner surface of scales; (ii) marginal osteoblasts elongated along the scale edge; and (iii) submarginal osteoblasts located between the central and marginal osteoblast populations. The size of the central osteoblasts increases progressively during development, suggesting that scale growth is mediated primarily by cell growth rather than the recruitment of new osteoblasts. In addition, the total number of central osteoblasts increases in regenerated scales and is correlated with scale size, possibly allowing for the rapid growth of regenerating scales. Moreover, osteoblast proliferation is not detected during regeneration, suggesting that the osteoblasts originate from post mitotic precursor cells. Sonic hedgehog a (shha) is expressed in the epidermal cells that make contact with the marginal osteoblasts. Pharmacological inhibition of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling during regeneration reduces the number of marginal osteoblasts and interferes with scale growth, indicating that epidermis derived Shh regulates scale regeneration. Finally, genetic inhibition of Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling in the epidermis results in misorientation of scales with regard to the body axis. These results reveal a novel role for the epidermis in the regulation of bone patterning, namely the regeneration of osteoblasts and directional bone growth.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: The anti tumor related diseases of Coptidis Rhizoma (Huanglian) were correlated with its traditional use of removing damp heat, clearing internal fire, and counteracting toxicity. In the recent years, Coptidis Rhizoma and its components have drawn extensive attention toward their anti tumor related diseases. Besides, Coptidis Rhizoma is traditionally used as an anti inflammatory herb. Epiberberine (EPI) is a significant alkaloid isolated from Coptidis Rhizoma, and exhibits multiple pharmacological activities including anti inflammatory. However, the effect of epiberberine on breast cancer and the inflammatory factors of metastatic breast cancer induced osteolysis has not been demonstrated clearly. Aim of the study: Bone metastatic breast cancer can lead to osteolysis via inflammatory factors induced osteoclast differentiation and function. In this study, we try to analyze the effect of epiberberine on breast cancer and the inflammatory factors of metastatic breast cancer induced osteolysis. Methods: To evaluate whether epiberberine could suppress bone metastatic breast cancer induced osteolytic damage, healthy female Balb/c mice were intratibially injected with murine triple negative breast cancer 4T1 cells. Then, we examined the inhibitory effect and underlying mechanism of epiberberine on breast cancerinduced osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Xenograft assay was used to study the effect of epiberberine on breast cancer cells in vivo. Moreover, we also studied the inhibitory effects and underlying mechanisms of epiberberine on RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation and function in vitro. Results: The results show that epiberberine displayed potential therapeutic effects on breast cancer induced osteolytic damage. Besides, our results show that epiberberine inhibited breast cancer cells induced osteoclast differentiation and function by inhibiting secreted inflammatory cytokines such as IL 8. Importantly, we found that epiberberine directly inhibited RANKL induced differentiation and function of osteoclast without cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, epiberberine inhibited RANKL induced osteoclastogensis via Akt/c Fos signaling pathway. Furthermore, epiberberine combined with docetaxel effectively protected against bone loss induced by metastatic breast cancer cells. Conclusions: Our findings suggested that epiberberine may be a promising natural compound for treating bone metastatic breast cancer induced osteolytic damage by inhibiting IL 8 and is worthy of further exploration in preclinical and clinical trials.

AB The treatment of large segmental defects of long bones resulting from trauma, infection, or bone tumor resections is a major challenge for orthopedic surgeons. The reconstruction of bone defects with acellular allografts can be used as an osteoconductive approach. However, devitalized allografts are associated with high rates of clinical failure as a result of poor intrinsic osteoinduction properties and a lack of further remodeling. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that due to its anabolic properties, teriparatide (PTH1 34) could be effective as an adjuvant therapy for massive allograft healing. Therefore, our goal was to investigate in a murine critical sized defect model whether the intermittent administration of PTH1 34 improves the incorporation and revitalization of acellular structural bone allografts. Thus, a 2.5 mm critical sized defect was established in the right femur of C57BL/6 mice, followed by the reconstruction with a devitalized cortical structural allograft. A titanium micro locking plate was applied to the anterior femoral surface and secured in place with self tapping locking screws. Subsequently, daily doses of PTH1 34 (30, and 40 mu g/kg) or saline were administered to the mice for 14 days after surgery. The mice were maintained without PTH1 34 therapy for an additional 7 days before being euthanized at 3 weeks post surgery. Bone graft consolidation was assessed on radiographic images and by histomorphometric analysis. Additionally, to determine the frequency of osteoprogenitor cells in the bone marrow and their in vitro osteogenic capacity, stromal cells were isolated from the bone marrow of animals treated with 30 or 40 mu g/kg/day of PTH1 34 following the same protocol used for the experimental animals. Our results suggest that intermittent PTH1 34 treatment at 30 mu g/kg/day after femoral allograft reconstruction surgery accelerated the healing process as evidenced by new bone formation induced on endosteal and periosteal surfaces, enhanced revitalization of allogeneic graft, and increased frequency and osteogenic capacity of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC). These findings should encourage further studies aimed at investigating the potential therapeutic use of intermittent PTH1 34, specifically with regards to the optimal dosing regimen in clinically challenging orthopedic scenarios.

AB Evodiamine is a biologically active alkaloid extracted from the fruit of the traditional Chinese medicine Evodia rutaecarpa (Juss.) Benth. (Fructus Evodiae, Wuzhuyu). However, due to its lipophilic chemical structure, low water solubility results in poor bio availability, which limits its broader application. 3 Amino 10 hydroxyl evodiamine (E2) was a water soluble derivative of evodiamine with good anti tumour bioactivity previously developed by our team; however, its anti osteoporosis activity remains unclear. This study demonstrates that E2 inhibits the maturation of osteoclasts and bone resorption promoted by receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL). Mechanistically, E2 reduced RANKL induced activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) as well as mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, causing the suppression of the expression of genes associated with osteoclasts in vitro. These genes included nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin k (CTSK) and dendritic cell specific transmembrane protein (DC STAMP). Treatment with E2 in vitro resulted in the attenuation of p ERK, p JNK, p p38 and NFATc1 levels. Furthermore, ovariectomized (OVX) mice treated with E2 showed a decrease in osteoclast formation as well as preservation of bone mass. This study concludes with evidence that E2 decreases osteoclast maturation and bone resorption through the regulation of multiple signalling pathways, thereby exhibiting an osteoprotective role in OVX mice. Consequently, E2 exhibits significant potential as a prospective drug candidate for treating osteoporosis.

TI Sclerostin: A Novel Target for Intervention in the Treatment of
   Osteoporosis
SO DISCOVERY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Bone remodeling is the process by which the adult skeleton is continually renewed through the highly coordinated activity of three types of cells   osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes. Disruptions in signaling among these cells and alterations in their activity have been associated with skeletal diseases. In a rare accident of nature, some families have been found to have dense and strong bones due to a recessive loss of function mutation in the SOST gene that encodes for sclerostin, a protein expressed by osteocytes that downregulates osteoblastic bone formation. Individuals who are homozygous for this mutation have sclerosteosis, a disease with no detectable circulating sclerostin, resulting in generalized osteosclerosis with skeletal deformities, cranial nerve compression, and increased intracranial pressure due to boney over growth in the skull, and premature death. However, family members who are heterozygous carriers for the mutation have normal phenotype and normal lifespan, with dense bones and low risk of fracture. This observation has led to the concept that compounds that reduce sclerostin levels might mimic the heterozygous carrier state and be effective in the treatment of osteoporosis. To this end, monoclonal antibodies to sclerostin have been developed. Preclinical and early clinical studies of sclerostin inhibitors have shown robust stimulation of osteoblastic bone formation. The investigational compound that has advanced the furthest in development is AMG 785 (CDP7851), a humanized monoclonal antibody to sclerostin. Monoclonal antibodies to sclerostin represent a class of compounds with potential benefit in the treatment of osteoporosis and other skeletal disorders.

AB Periodontitis is one of the most widespread infectious diseases that troubled the majority of adults. Human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) have been reported as a promising therapy for the treatment of periodontitis. Melatonin, an indoleamine hormone from pineal gland, has various biological activities such as anti inflammation, anti cancer and so on. However, whether it is functional in periodontitis is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of melatonin in periodontitis and elucidate the molecular mechanism. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to stimulate hPDLSCs, and viability of hPDLSCs that was treated with melatonin (0, 1, 10, 50 and 100 mu mol/L) for 24 h or 48 h was determined by MTT assay. Flow cytometry analysis was carried out to detect the influence of melatonin on cell proliferation. Osteogenic differentiation ability of melatonin was determined by Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay kit and Alizarin Red Staining. Lastly, western blot was used for the determination of protein expressions related to proliferation, differentiation and ERK/Wnt signaling activity. The results showed that LPS significantly inhibited cell viability, which was reversed by melatonin, especially at 10 mu M for 48 h and at 50 mu M for 24 h. Melatonin (10 mu M, 48 h) and melatonin (50 mu M, 24 h) notably induced G0/G1 phase cell arrest, increased the expression of CDK2, cyclin E and decreased the expression of p27 in LPS stimulated hPDLSCs. Besides, melatonin significantly promoted cell differentiation through increasing ALP activity, mineralization and protein expressions of Oct4, Sox 2, Runx2 and bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP 2). Additionally, BMP 2 related ERK and Wnt signaling was activated with the treatment of melatonin in LPS stimulated hPDLSCs. Collectively, melatonin could improve cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in LPS stimulated hPDLSCs, partly through regulating BMP2 related ERK/Wnt pathway.

AB Metabolic skeletal disorders associated with impaired bone formation are a major clinical challenge. One approach to treat these defects is to silence bone formation inhibitory genes by small interference RNAs (siRNAs) in osteogenic lineage cells that occupy the niche surrounding the bone formation surfaces. We developed a targeting system involving dioleoyl trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) based cationic liposomes attached to six repetitive sequences of aspartate, serine, serine ((AspSerSer)(6)) for delivering siRNAs specifically to bone formation surfaces. Using this system, we encapsulated an osteogenic siRNA that targets casein kinase 2 interacting protein 1 (encoded by Plekho1, also known as Plekho1). In vivo systemic delivery of Plekho1 siRNA in rats using our system resulted in the selective enrichment of the siRNAs in osteogenic cells and the subsequent depletion of Plekho1. A bioimaging analysis further showed that this approach markedly promoted bone formation, enhanced the bone micro architecture and increased the bone mass in both healthy and osteoporotic rats. These results indicate (AspSerSer)(6) liposome as a promising targeted delivery system for RNA interference  based bone anabolic therapy.

AB In an effort to improve our understanding and treatment of cancer, a new model of tumorigenesis is being developed the cancer stem cell model. Building upon traditional concepts of cancer and stem cells, this model is intended to shed new light on the continuing struggle with treatment challenges such as tumor drug resistance and recurrence. This review describes the cancer stem cell model with an emphasis on delineating markers that represent a "stemness" phenotype within certain tumor cells. The objective of this delineation is to develop targeted therapies for the selective elimination of cancer stem cells with minimal toxicity to normal stem cells and tissues. However, this specific targeting of cancer stem cells has proved to be a significant challenge due to the similarity of markers expressed by both normal and cancer stem cells. Still, research in the area of cancer biomarkers is steadily progressing.

AB Excessive consumption of saturated fatty acids creates a debilitating cellular environment that hinders the normal function and survival of osteoblasts, contributing to bone metabolic disorders such as osteoporosis. The FDA approved polypeptide PTH 1 34 is a well established therapy for post menopausal osteoporosis, yet its protective effects in a palmitic acid (PA) rich hyperlipidemic environment are not well understood. This study investigates the impact of PTH 1 34 on PA induced cellular responses in osteoblasts. Experiments were conducted on mouse and human derived osteoblasts as well as C57BL/6J male mice. PA was found to suppress osteoblast differentiation, increase apoptosis, and disrupt autophagy, and thereby impair cellular health. Conversely, PTH 1 34 enhanced cellular health by counteracting these effects. At the molecular level, PTH 1 34 exerted its bioactivity by modulating PTH signaling components such as cAMP and CREB. Impaired osteogenic differentiation was restored by modulating bone anabolic genes. PTH 1 34 also improved mitochondrial health by preserving mitochondrial membrane potential and maintaining the Bax/Bcl2 ratio, thereby improving cellular viability. Additionally, PTH 1 34 regulated autophagic processes, as evidenced by balanced p62 and LC3 levels, further validated using the autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin A1. In vivo studies in C57BL/6J male mice corroborated these findings. PTH 1 34 reversed the PA action by maintaining osteoblast number and function. This study establishes the protective role of PTH 1 34 in safeguarding osteoblasts from lipotoxicity caused by excessive PA accumulation, highlighting its potential repurposing for patients with lipid induced skeletal dysfunctions. The new data underscores the therapeutic versatility of the FDA approved polypeptide PTH 1 34 in managing lipid related bone health issues.

AB Triptolide (TP) is the primary pharmacological component of Tripterygium Glycosides (TG), which has antiinflammatory, antiproliferative, and immunosuppressive properties, among other pharmacological actions, and has excellent potential for developing into a new DMARD. We have reviewed the effects and mechanisms of TP on immunosuppression, inhibiting synovial proliferation, and preventing articular bone destruction in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is a common disease in the elderly in this paper. We have found that TP has regulatory effects on multiple vital cells in the above mentioned pathological process of RA, such as monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, fibroblast like synoviocytes, and osteoclasts. We also found that TP can regulate multiple key signaling pathways such as NF kappa B, JAK/STAT, and MAPK through various molecular regulatory mechanisms, achieving regulatory effects on numerous phenotypes of the above mentioned vital cells.

AB Collagen peptides are widely used in food and medicine industries. Given the significant role of collagen in bone structure, collagen peptides are considered promising for osteoporosis prevention and treatment. To elucidate their effect on osteoporosis, we extracted porcine collagen, digested it into peptides, and investigated their biological function using osteoblast MC3T3 E1 cells. The collagen structure was relatively stable and we prepared peptides with different molecular weights (MWs) via hydrolysis with two commercially available enzymes (alcalase/trypsin). Low MW ( < 1 kDa) peptides, mainly comprised of tripeptides, increased proliferation and promoted cell cycle progression by upregulating CDK 2, CDK 4, Cyclin B1, and Cyclin D1, and inhibited apoptosis by decreasing Bax/Bcl 2 and cleaved caspase 3 expression. Meanwhile, they upregulated p Akt and downregulated PTEN, indicating that low MW peptides inhibited apoptosis and promoted osteoblast proliferation and differentiation by activating PI3K/Akt pathway. Thus, we report the mechanism through which porcine bone derived collagen peptides could be used to prevent and treat osteoporosis.

AB Pharmacological therapy of osteoporosis reduces bone loss and risk of fracture in patients. Modulation of bone mineral density cannot explain all effects. Other aspects of bone quality affecting fragility and ways to monitor them need to be better understood. Keratinous tissue acts as surrogate marker for bone protein deterioration caused by oestrogen deficiency in rats. Ovariectomised rats were treated with alendronate (ALN), parathyroid hormone (PTH) or estrogen (E2). MicroCT assessed macro structural changes. Raman spectroscopy assessed biochemical changes. Micro CT confirmed that all treatments prevented ovariectomy induced macro structural bone loss in rats. PTH induced macro structural changes unrelated to ovariectomy. Raman analysis revealed ALN and PTH partially protect against molecular level changes to bone collagen (80% protection) and mineral (50% protection) phases. E2 failed to prevent biochemical change. The treatments induced alterations unassociated with the ovariectomy; increased beta sheet with E2, globular alpha helices with PTH and fibrous alpha helices with both ALN and PTH. ALN is closest to maintaining physiological status of the animals, while PTH (comparable protective effect) induces side effects. E2 is unable to prevent molecular level changes associated with ovariectomy. Raman spectroscopy can act as predictive tool for monitoring pharmacological therapy of osteoporosis in rodents. Keratinous tissue is a useful surrogate marker for the protein related impact of these therapies.The results demonstrate utility of surrogates where a clear systemic causation connects the surrogate to the target tissue. It demonstrates the need to assess broader biomolecular impact of interventions to examine side effects.

AB Magnolia officinalis, a component of Asian herbal teas, has long been employed in traditional Japanese and Chinese medicine to treat numerous maladies. Honokiol, a biphenolie compound, is now considered to be one of the major active ingredients of Magnolia extract, and is under intense investigation for its anti angiogenic, anti inflammatory, antitumor and neuroprotective properties. Biochemically, honokiol has been recognized to modulate the nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) signal transduction pathway suggesting that it possesses anti inflammatory properties. Inflammation is intimately associated with bone turnover and skeletal deterioration and consequently, anti inflammatory drugs may hold significant promise as bone protective agents to stem bone loss in osteoporotic conditions. We and others have demonstrated that suppression of NF kappa B blunts osteoclastic bone resorption, but promotes osteoblastic bone formation. Indeed previous studies have demonstrated the anti osteoclastogenic effects of honokiol, however, activities on osteoblast differentiation and activity have yet to be investigated. In this study, we show that honokiol is a potent inducer of in vitro osteoblast differentiation by virtue of its capacity to suppress basal and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) induced NF kappa B activation and to alleviate the suppressive action of TNF alpha on bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2 induced Smad activation. Our data confirm that honokiol may have considerable promise as a dual anabolic/anti catabolic agent for the amelioration of multiple osteoporotic diseases.

AB Stem/progenitor cell based regenerative medicine using the osteoblast differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is regarded as a promising approach for the therapeutic treatment of various bone defects. The effects of the osteogenic differentiation of stem/progenitor cells on osteoclast differentiation may have important implications for use in therapy. However, there is little data regarding the expression of osteoclastogenic proteins during osteoblastic differentiation of human periosteum derived cells (hPDCs) and whether factors expressed during this process can modulate osteoclastogenesis. In the present study, we measured expression of RANKL in hPDCs undergoing osteoblastic differentiation and found that expression of RANKL mRNA was markedly increased in these cells in a time dependent manner. RANKL protein expression was also significantly enhanced in osteogenic conditioned media from hPDCs undergoing osteoblastic differentiation. We then isolated and cultured CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from umbilical cord blood (UCB) mononuclear cells (MNCs) and found that these cells were well differentiated into several hematopoietic lineages. Finally, we co cultured human trabecular bone osteoblasts (hOBs) with CD34+ HSCs and used the conditioned medium, collected from hPDCs during osteoblastic differentiation, to investigate whether factors produced during osteoblast maturation can affect osteoclast differentiation. Specifically, we measured the effect of this osteogenic conditioned media on expression of osteoclastogenic markers and osteoclast cell number. We found that osteoclastic marker gene expression was highest in co cultures incubated with the conditioned medium collected from hPDCs with the greatest level of osteogenic maturation. Although further study will be needed to clarify the precise mechanisms that underlie osteogenic conditioned medium regulated osteoclastogenesis, our results suggest that the osteogenic maturation of hPDCs could promote osteoclastic potential

AB Background:Fracture repair involves the reactivation of developmental signaling cascades, including Wnt signaling that stimulates bone formation and bone regeneration. Rodent data indicate that dual inhibition of the Wnt signaling antagonists sclerostin and Dickkopf 1 (DKK1) increases callus bone volume and strength while increasing bone mass systemically.Methods:We evaluated the effects of 16 weeks of subcutaneously administered carrier solution (vehicle, VEH), anti sclerostin antibody (Scl Ab), anti DKK1 antibody (DKK1 Ab), or Scl Ab plus DKK1 Ab combination therapy (COMBO) on ulnar osteotomy healing in nonhuman primates (cynomolgus monkeys; 20 to 22 per group).Results:Scl Ab and COMBO therapy increased systemic markers of bone formation versus VEH, with COMBO leading to synergistic increases versus Scl Ab or DKK1 Ab monotherapies. The COMBO and Scl Ab groups showed reduced serum markers of bone resorption versus VEH. The COMBO and DKK1 Ab groups exhibited greater callus bone mineral density (BMD), torsional stiffness, and torsional rigidity versus VEH. Lumbar vertebrae from the Scl Ab and COMBO groups showed greater BMD and bone formation rate versus VEH, and the femoral mid diaphysis of the Scl Ab and COMBO groups showed greater periosteal and endocortical bone formation rates versus VEH.Conclusions:DKK1 Ab increased BMD and strength at the ulnar osteotomy site, Scl Ab increased bone formation and BMD at uninjured skeletal sites, and Scl Ab plus DKK1 Ab combination therapy induced all of these effects, in some cases to a greater degree versus 1 or both monotherapies. These results in nonhuman primates suggest that DKK1 preferentially regulates bone healing while sclerostin preferentially regulates systemic bone mass.

AB Cell differentiation and patterning are vital processes in the development of the appendicular skeleton. The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays a central role in regulating the anterior posterior axis of the distal limb as well as the length of endochondral bones. Ligand induced Hh signaling inhibits the processing of the Gli transcription factors from activator to repressor isoforms. In the growth plate, Indian hedgehog inhibits Gil processing, resulting in accumulation of Gli activators that induce chondrocyte maturation and hypertrophic differentiation. Parathyroid hormone like hormone promoted and Gli processing to repressor forms, thus regulating the rate of hypertrophic differentiation. In cartilage diseases such as osteoarthritis and cartilage tumors, there is a recapitulation of developmental processes that involve increased Rh signaling. Studies have shown that pharmacological inhibitors of Hh signaling can attenuate the progression osteoarthritis and cartilage tumor growth. Thus, Hh blockade can serve as a potential therapy for the treatment of various cartilage diseases. (C) 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is indispensable in embryonic development, and its dysregulated activity results in severe developmental disorders as shown by genetic models of naturally occurring mutations in animal and human pathologies. Hh signaling also functions in postembryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis, and its aberrant activity causes various human cancers. Better understanding of molecular regulators of Hh signaling is of fundamental importance in finding new strategies for pathway modulation. Here, we identify liver X receptors (LXRs), members of the nuclear hormone receptor family, as previously unrecognized negative regulators of Hh signaling. Activation of LXR by specific pharmacological ligands, TO901317 and GW3965, inhibited the responses of pluripotent bone marrow stromal cells and calvaria organ cultures to sonic Hh, resulting in the inhibition of expression of Hh target genes, Gli1 and Patched1, and Gli dependent transcriptional activity. Moreover, LXR ligands inhibited sonic Hh induced differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells into osteoblasts. Elimination of LXRs by small interfering RNA inhibited ligand induced inhibition of Hh target gene expression. Furthermore, LXR ligand did not inhibit Hh responsiveness in mouse embryonic fibroblasts that do not express LXRs, whereas introduction of LXR into these cells reestablished the inhibitory effects. Daily oral administration of TO901317 to mice after 3 d significantly inhibited baseline Hh target gene expression in liver, lung, and spleen. Given the importance of modulating Hh signaling in various physiological and pathological settings, our findings suggest that pharmacological targeting of LXRs may be a novel strategy for Hh pathway modulation.

AB Background: HSP90 inhibitors increase osteoclast formation and bone loss. Results: Altered Hsf1 activity impacts the ability of stress inducing compounds to modulate osteoclast formation. Conclusion: Hsf1 plays an important role in stress associated osteoclast formation, potentially via MITF. Significance: We identified a novel pathway whereby agents inducing stress can enhance osteoclast formation.
   Many anticancer therapeutic agents cause bone loss, which increases the risk of fractures that severely reduce quality of life. Thus, in drug development, it is critical to identify and understand such effects. Anticancer therapeutic and HSP90 inhibitor 17 (allylamino) 17 demethoxygeldanamycin (17 AAG) causes bone loss by increasing osteoclast formation, but the mechanism underlying this is not understood. 17 AAG activates heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1), the master transcriptional regulator of heat shock/cell stress responses, which may be involved in this negative action of 17 AAG upon bone. Using mouse bone marrow and RAW264.7 osteoclast differentiation models we found that HSP90 inhibitors that induced a heat shock response also enhanced osteoclast formation, whereas HSP90 inhibitors that did not (including coumermycin A1 and novobiocin) did not affect osteoclast formation. Pharmacological inhibition or shRNAmir knockdown of Hsf1 in RAW264.7 cells as well as the use of Hsf1 null mouse bone marrow cells demonstrated that 17 AAG enhanced osteoclast formation was Hsf1 dependent. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of Hsf1 enhanced 17 AAG effects upon osteoclast formation. Consistent with these findings, protein levels of the essential osteoclast transcription factor microphthalmia associated transcription factor were increased by 17 AAG in an Hsf1 dependent manner. In addition to HSP90 inhibitors, we also identified that other agents that induced cellular stress, such as ethanol, doxorubicin, and methotrexate, also directly increased osteoclast formation, potentially in an Hsf1 dependent manner. These results, therefore, indicate that cellular stress can enhance osteoclast differentiation via Hsf1 dependent mechanisms and may significantly contribute to pathological and therapeutic related bone loss.

AB The receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) is a key factor in regulating osteoclastogenesis and in maintaining the survival of mature osteoclasts. We screened differentially expressed genes in RAW264.7 cells in response to RANKL and found osteoclast stimulatory transmembrane protein (OC STAMP) as one of the RANKL induced genes of interest. Recently, OC STAMP has been identified as the RANKL induced protein that promotes osteoclast differentiation, but the mechanism that regulates its expression is not understood. Therefore, the tissue distribution of OC STAMP and the signaling pathways that regulate its expression were studied here. Similar to osteoclasts, OC STAMP was expressed in most tissues, suggesting its involvement in the function of other tissues. Interestingly, OC STAMP was downregulated by 17 beta estradiol at high concentrations, suggesting the potential relationship between OC STAMP and estrogen. Importantly, the knockdown of OC STAMP at the transcript level resulted in the inhibition of multinucleated osteoclast formation and the decreased expression of genes including transcription factor (such as c Jun), receptors (such as RANK and c Fms), a signaling molecule (such as TRAF6), and a cell fusion related molecule (such as meltrin alpha), suggesting that the osteoclast differentiation needs the coordinated expression of OC STAMP with several molecules required for transcription, signaling transduction, and cell fusion. Additionally, the treatment of its specific antibody inhibited the formation and bone resorptive activity of mature osteoclasts, suggesting its involvement in the function of mature osteoclasts. Furthermore, studies with pharmacological inhibitors suggested PKC beta or Akt might be the major signaling molecules to regulate the expression of OC STAMP during osteoclastogenesis.

AB Molecular targeting of the two receptor interaction domains of the epigenetic repressor silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRTmRID) produced a transplantable skeletal syndrome that reduced radial bone growth, increased numbers of bone resorbing periosteal osteoclasts, and increased bone fracture risk. Furthermore, SMRTmRID mice develop spontaneous primary myelofibrosis, a chronic, usually idiopathic disorder characterized by progressive bone marrow fibrosis. Frequently linked to polycythemia vera and chronic myeloid leukemia, myelofibrosis displays high patient morbidity and mortality, and current treatment is mostly palliative. To decipher the etiology of this disease, we identified the thrombopoietin (Tpo) gene as a target of the SMRT retinoic acid receptor signaling pathway in bone marrow stromal cells. Chronic induction of Tpo in SMRTmRID mice results in up regulation of TGF beta and PDGF in megakaryocytes, uncontrolled proliferation of bone marrow reticular cells, and fibrosis of the marrow compartment. Of therapeutic relevance, we show that this syndrome can be rescued by retinoid antagonists, demonstrating that the physical interface between SMRT and retinoic acid receptor can be a potential therapeutic target to block primary myelofibrosis disease progression.

AB Improper activity of bone resorbing osteoclasts results in low bone density and deterioration of bone structure, which increase the risk of fractures. Anti resorptive therapies targeting osteoclasts have proven effective in preserving bone mass, but these therapeutic agents lead to defective new bone formation and numerous potential side effects. In this study, we demonstrate that recombinant adeno associated virus, serotype 9 (rAAV9) can deliver to osteoclasts an artificial microRNA (amiR) that silences expression of key osteoclast regulators, RANK (receptor activator for nuclear factor kappa B) and cathepsin K (rAAV9.amiR rank, rAAV9.amiR ctsk), to prevent bone loss in osteoporosis. As rAAV9 is highly effective for the transduction of osteoclasts, systemic administration of rAAV9 carrying amiR rank or amiR ctsk results in a significant increase of bone mass in mice. Furthermore, the bone targeting peptide motif (Asp) 14 or (AspSerSer)(6) was grafted onto the AAV9 VP2 capsid protein, resulting in significant reduction of transgene expression in non bone peripheral organs. Finally, systemic delivery of bone targeting rAAV9.amiR ctsk counteracts bone loss and improves bone mechanical properties in mouse models of postmenopausal and senile osteoporosis. Collectively, inhibition of osteoclast mediated bone resorption via bone targeting rAAV9 mediated silencing of ctsk is a promising gene therapy that can preserve bone formation and mitigate osteoporosis, while limiting adverse off target effects.

AB Estrogen analogues are promising drugs for postmenopausal osteoporosis, but because of their possible side effects such as increased risk of cancer, estrogens which exert their estrogenic effects selectively on bone are desired. It has been shown that rhein inhibits osteoclast formation and bone resorption activity and has an antitumor role in several types of cancers. Having found that rhein had high affinity for the bone mineral, we synthesized estrone rhein hybrid compounds and confirmed that one of these hybrid compounds. LC, exhibited a selective profile in the bone and prevented bone loss but had no effect on endometrium growth in ovariectomized rats. However, the mechanisms underlying its actions on human bone cells have not been well defined. Here we show that LC concurrently stimulates osteoprotegerin (OPG) and inhibits receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) and Interleukin 6 (IL 6) production by human osteoblastic MG 63 cells containing two estrogen receptor (ER) isotypes. Treatment with the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 abrogates the above actions of LC on osteoblast derived cells. Using small interfering double stranded RNAs (siRNA) technology, we further demonstrate that the effects of LC on IL 6 production are mediated by both ER alpha and ER beta but those on OPG and RANKL expression primarily by ER alpha. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that LC functions at least partially through activation of the classic estrogen response element (ERE) pathway as well as Ras/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling. The effect of LC on bone is due to not only its estrogenic activity but also action of its rhein moiety. Also, this compound shows much weaker effect on breast epithelial cell growth than that of estrone. Therefore, using rhein for conjugating compounds is a promising method of effectively targeting estrogens to the bone. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Picroside II, one of the major components isolated from the seed of natural plant picrorhiza, is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine. The present study was performed to define effects of picroside II on nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL) stimulated osteoclast differentiation in vitro and on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced bone loss in vivo. The bone marrow cells (BMMs) were harvested and induced with RANKL followed by treatment with picroside II at several doses, and the differentiation of osteoclasts from these cells was evaluated by tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and resorption pit formation assay. The effects of picroside II on osteoclastogenesis were studied by examining RANKL induced osteoclast F actin ring formation and osteoclast bone resorption. Moreover, we explored the mechanisms of these downregulation effects by performed Western blotting and quantitative RT PCR examination. Results demonstrated picroside II strongly inhibited RANKL induced osteoclast formation when added during the early stage of BMMs cultures, suggesting that it acts on osteoclast precursors to inhibit RANKL/RANK signaling. Moreover, picroside II markedly decreased the phosphorylation of p38, ERK, JNK, p65, and I B degradation, and significantly suppressed c Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), both the key transcription factors during osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, in vivo studies verified the bone protection effects of picroside II. These results collectively suggested that picroside II acted as an anti resorption agent by blocking osteoclast activation. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 4479 4486, 2017. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Abnormal activation and overproliferation of osteoclast in inflammatory bone diseases lead to osteolysis and bone mass loss. Although current pharmacological treatments have made extensive advances, limitations still exist. N [2 bromo 4 (phenylsulfonyl) 3 thienyl] 2 chlorobenzamide (BNTA) is an artificially synthesized molecule compound that has antioxidant and anti inflammatory properties. In this study, we presented that BNTA can suppress intracellular ROS levels through increasing ROS scavenging enzymes SOD1 and SOD2, subsequently attenuating the MARK signaling pathway and the transcription of NFATc1, leading to the inhibition of osteoclast formation and osteolytic resorption. Moreover, the results also showed an obvious restrained effect of BNTA on RANKL stimulated proinflammatory cytokines, which indirectly mediated osteoclastogenesis. In line with the in vitro results, BNTA protected LPS induced severe bone loss in vivo by enhancing scavenging enzymes, reducing proinflammatory cytokines, and decreasing osteoclast formation. Taken together, all of the results demonstrate that BNTA effectively represses oxidation, regulates inflammatory activity, and inhibits osteolytic bone resorption, and it may be a potential and exploitable drug to prevent inflammatory osteolytic bone diseases.

AB Objective. Immunosuppressive biologics are used in the management of RA and additional immunomodulators are under investigation including modulators of the CD40/CD40 ligand (CD40L) costimulation pathway. Tampering with immune function can have unanticipated skeletal consequences due to disruption of the immuno skeletal interface, a nexus of shared cells and cytokine effectors serving discrete functions in both immune and skeletal systems. In this study, we examined the effect of MR1, a CD40L neutralizing antibody, on physiological bone remodelling in healthy mice.
   Methods. Female C57BL6 mice were treated with MR1 and BMD was quantified by dual energy X ray absorptiometry and indices of trabecular bone structure were quantified by micro CT. Serum biochemical markers were used to evaluate bone turnover and formation indices by histomorphometry.
   Results. Unexpectedly, MR1 stimulated significant accretion of BMD and trabecular bone mass in the spine, but not in long bones. Surprisingly, bone accretion was accompanied by a significant increase in bone formation, rather than suppression of bone resorption. Mechanistically, MR1 induced bone accrual was associated with increased Treg development and elevated production of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4, a costimulation inhibitor that promotes T cell anergy and CD8(+) T cell expression of the bone anabolic ligand Wnt 10b.
   Conclusion. Our studies reveal an unexpected bone anabolic activity of pharmacological CD40L suppression. Therapeutic targeting of the CD40L pathway may indeed have unforeseen consequences for the skeleton, but may also constitute a novel strategy to promote bone formation to ameliorate osteoporotic bone loss and reduce fracture risk in the axial skeleton.

AB Bone diseases ( including osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and bone cancer) are of great concern to the medical world. Drugs are available to treat such diseases, but often these drugs are not specifically targeted to the site of the disease and, thus, lack an immediate directed therapeutic effect. The optimal drug delivery system should enhance healthy bone growth with high specificity to the site of bone disease. It has been previously shown that magnetic nanoparticles can be directed in the presence of a magnetic field to any part of the body, allowing for site specific drug delivery and possibly an immediate increase in bone density. The objective of the present study was to build off of this evidence and determine the density of osteoblasts ( bone forming cells) in the presence of various uncoated and coated magnetic nanoparticles that could eventually be used in drug delivery applications. Results showed that some magnetic nanoparticles (specifically, gamma Fe2O3) significantly promoted osteoblast density ( that is, cells per well) after 5 and 8 days of culture compared to controls ( no particles). These magnetic nanoparticles were further coated with calcium phosphate (CaP; the main inorganic component of bone) to tailor them for treating various bone diseases. The coatings were conducted in the presence of either bovine serum albumin (BSA) or citric acid ( CA) to reduce magnetic nanoparticle agglomeration, a common problem resulting from the use of nanoparticles which decreases their effectiveness. Results with these coatings showed that magnetic nanoparticles, specifically (gamma Fe2O3), coated in the presence of BSA significantly increased osteoblast density compared to controls after 1 day. In this manner, this study provided unexpected evidence that CaP coated gamma Fe2O3 magnetic nanoparticles increased osteoblast density ( compared to no particles) and, thus, should be further studied to treat numerous bone diseases.

AB Context: Intermittent PTH treatment stimulates bone formation, but the mechanism(s) of this effect remain unclear. Sclerostin is an inhibitor of Wnt signaling, and animal studies have demonstrated that PTH suppresses sclerostin production.
   Objective: The objective of the study was to test whether intermittent PTH treatment of postmenopausal women alters circulating sclerostin levels.
   Design: Prospective study.
   Setting: The study was conducted at a clinical research unit.
   Participants and Interventions: Participants included 27 postmenopausal women treated with PTH (1 34) for 14 d and 28 control women.
   Main Outcome Measures: Serum sclerostin levels were measured.
   Results: Circulating sclerostin levels decreased significantly in the PTH treated subjects, from (mean +/  SEM) 551 +/  32 to 482 +/  31 pg/ml ( 12.7%, P < 0.0001) but did not change in the control women (baseline, 559 +/  34 pg/ml; end point, 537 +/  40 pg/ml, P = 0.207; P = 0.017 for difference in changes between groups). Bone marrow plasma was obtained in a subset of the control and PTH treated subjects (n = 19 each) at the end of the treatment period, and marrow plasma and peripheral serum sclerostin levels were significantly correlated (R = 0.64, P < 0.0001). Marrow plasma sclerostin levels were 24% lower in PTH treated compared with control women, but perhaps due to the smaller sample size, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.173).
   Conclusions: Circulating sclerostin levels correlate with bone marrow plasma levels and are reduced by intermittent PTH therapy in postmenopausal women. Further studies are needed to assess the extent to which decreases in sclerostin production contribute to the anabolic skeletal response to PTH. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 95: 5056 5062, 2010)

AB Bisphosphonates are widely used agents for the treatment of malignant bone disease. They inhibit osteoclast mediated bone resorption and can have direct effects on cancer cells. In this study, we investigated whether the anticancer activity of the third generation bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (ZOL) could be enhanced by combination with the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). We found that ZOL and SAHA cooperated to induce cell death in the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC 3. The effect was synergistic, as evidenced by combination index isobologram analysis. ZOL and SAHA synergized to induce dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, to activate caspase 3, and to trigger DNA fragmentation, showing that the combination of ZOL and SAHA resulted in the initiation of apoptosis. Because ZOL acts by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway, thereby preventing protein prenylation, we explored whether the mevalonate pathway was also the target of the cooperative action of ZOL and SAHA. We found that geranylgeraniol, but not farnesol, significantly reduced ZOL/SAHA induced cell death, indicating that the synergistic action of the agents was due to the inhibition of geranylgeranylation. Consistently, a direct inhibitor of geranylgeranylation, GGTI 298, synergized with SAHA to induce cell death, whereas an inhibitor of farnesylation, FTI 277, had no effect. In addition, SAHA synergized with mevastatin, an inhibitor of the proximal enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. These in vitro findings provide a rationale for an in vivo exploration into the potential of combining SAHA and ZOL, or other inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway, as an effective strategy for anticancer therapy.

AB Osteocytes reside as a cellular network throughout the mineralised matrix of bone and are considered the primary mechanosensors of this tissue. They sense mechanical stimulation such as fluid flow and are able to regulate osteoblast and osteoclast functions on the bone surface. Previously, we found that ATP is released load dependently from osteocytes from the onset of mechanical stimulation. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether and how ATP release can be evoked in osteocytes via purinergic receptor activation. ATP release was quantified by real time determination using the luciferin luciferase assay and the release pathway was investigated using pharmacological inhibition. The P2Y receptor profile was analysed using gene expression analysis by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, while functional testing was performed using measurements of intracellular calcium responses to P2 receptor agonists. These investigations demonstrated that MLO Y4 osteocytes express functional P2Y(2), P2Y(4), P2Y(12) and P2Y(13) receptors in addition to the previously reported P2X receptors. Further, we found that osteocytes respond to nucleotides such as ATP, UTP and ADP by increasing the intracellular calcium concentration and that they release ATP dose dependently upon stimulation with 1 10 mu M UTP. In addition to this, osteocytes release large amounts of ATP upon cell rupture, which might also be a source for other nucleotides, such as UTP. These findings indicate that mechanically induced ATP signals may be propagated by P2 receptor activation and further ATP release in the osteocyte network and implicate purinergic signalling as a central signalling pathway in osteocyte mechanotransduction.

AB Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an anabolic agent that mediates bone formation through activation of the G alpha(s) , G alpha(q)  and beta arrestin coupled parathyroid hormone receptor type 1 (PTH1R). Pharmacological evidence based on the effect of PTH(7 34), a PTH derivative that is said to preferentially activate beta arrestin signaling through PTH1R, suggests that PTH1R activated beta arrestin signaling mediates anabolic effects on bone. Here, we performed a thorough evaluation of PTH(7 34) signaling behaviour using quantitative assays for beta arrestin recruitment, G alpha(s)  and G alpha(q)  signaling. We found that PTH(7 34) inhibited PTH induced CAMP accumulation, but was unable to induce beta arrestin recruitment, PTH1R internalization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HEK293, CHO and U2OS cells. Thus, the beta arrestin bias of PTH(7 34) is not apparent in every cell type examined, suggesting that correlating in vivo effects of PTH(7 34) to in vitro pharmacology should be done with caution.

AB The vicious cycle between tumor cell proliferation and bone resorption remarkably elevates the progression and metastasis of bone tumors. Here, we fabricated polyethylene glycol conjugated alendronate functionalized and chloroquine (CQ) loaded polydopamine nanoparticles (PPA/CQ) for efficient treatment of bone tumorsviabreaking the vicious cycle. The nanoparticles were efficiently accumulated to the bone tissues, especially the osteolytic lesions around tumors. CQ released from PPA/CQ inhibited osteoclastogenesisviapreventing the degradation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated receptor 3 to attenuate the osteolysis in bone tumors. On the other hand, CQ blocked the autophagy in cancer cells, resulting in improved photothermal killing of cancer cells. Finally, thein vivoexperiment revealed that PPA/CQ associated treatment efficiently inhibited both tumor growth and osteolysis. This work suggests that autophagy inhibition associated photothermal therapy could be a promising strategy for treating malignant bone tumors.

TI Induction of Osteogenesis in Mesenchymal Stem Cells by Activated
   Monocytes/Macrophages Depends on Oncostatin M Signaling

AB Bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts are tightly coupled processes implicating factors in TNF, bone morphogenetic protein, and Wnt families. In osteoimmunology, macrophages were described as another critical cell population regulating bone formation by osteoblasts but the coupling factors were not identified. Using a high throughput approach, we identified here Oncostatin M (OSM), a cytokine of the IL 6 family, as a major coupling factor produced by activated circulating CD14+ or bone marrow CD11b+ monocytes/macrophages that induce osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization from human mesenchymal stem cells while inhibiting adipogenesis. Upon activation of toll like receptors (TLRs) by lipopolysaccharide or endogenous ligands, OSM was produced in classically activated inflammatory M1 and not M2 macrophages, through a cyclooxygenase 2 and prostaglandin E2 regulatory loop. Stimulation of osteogenesis by activated monocytes/macrophages was prevented using neutralizing antibodies or siRNA to OSM, OSM receptor subunits gp130 and OSMR, or to the downstream transcription factor STAT3. The induced osteoblast differentiation program culminated with enhanced expression of CCAAT enhancer binding protein d, Cbfa1, and alkaline phosphatase. Overexpression of OSM in the tibia of mice has led to new bone apposition with no sign of bone resorption. Two other cytokines have also a potent role in bone formation induced by monocytes/macrophages and activation of TLRs: IL 6 and leukemia inhibitory factor. We propose that during bone inflammation, infection, or injury, the IL 6 family signaling network activated by macrophages and TLR ligands stimulates bone formation that is largely uncoupled from bone resorption and is thus an important target for anabolic bone therapies.

AB Background:Exosomes have emerged as pivotal mediators in modulating physiological and pathological processes implicated in osteoporosis (OP) through their distinctive mode of intracellular communication. The use of exosomes has evoked considerable interest, catalyzing a surge in research endeavors on a global scale. This study endeavors to scrutinize contemporary landscapes and burgeoning trends in this realm.Methods:The Web of Science Core Collection was used to retrieve publications on exosomes therapy for OP within the time frame of January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2023. The bibliometric methodology was applied to study and index the collected data. VOSviewer and citespace software were used to conduct visualization, co authorship, co occurrence, and publication trend analyses of exosome therapy in OP.Results:A total of 610 publications (443 articles and 167 reviews) from 51 countries and 911 institutions were included in this study. Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Central South University, Sichuan University, and Zhejiang University are leading research institutions in this field. Stem Cell Research Therapy published the highest number of articles and has emerged as the most cited journal. Of the 4077 scholars who participated in the study, Xie, Hui, Zhang, Yan, Tan, and Yi Juan had the largest number of articles. Furthermore, according to the cluster analysis of external keywords, future research hotspots can be categorized into 3 directions: research status of exosomes for the treatment of OP, treatment of OP through exosome regulated signaling pathways, and exosomes as targeted drug delivery systems.Conclusion:This study suggests that the number of future publications on exosome therapy for OP will increase, with a focus on fundamental investigations into drug loading capacities and molecular mechanisms. In summary, this study presents the first systematic bibliometric analysis of exosome therapy publications in OP, providing an objective and comprehensive overview of the field and a valuable reference for researchers in this domain.

AB Current therapies of steroid hormone dependent diseases predominantly alter steroid hormone concentrations (or their actions) in plasma, in target and nontarget tissues alike, rather than in target organs only. Targeted therapy through the inhibition of steroidogenic enzymes may pose an attractive alternative with much less side effects. Here, we describe the design of a nanomolar potent 17 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (17 beta HSD2) inhibitor (compound 15) and successful targeted intracrine therapy in a mouse bone fracture model. Blockade of 17 beta HSD2 in bone is thought to increase intracellular estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T), which thereby inhibits bone resorption by osteoclasts and stimulates bone formation by osteoblasts, respectively. Administration of compound 15 in the mouse fracture model strongly increases the mechanical stability of the healing fractured bone because of a larger periosteal callus with newly formed bone without changing the plasma E2 and T concentrations. Steroidogenic 17 beta HSD2 inhibition thus enables targeted intracrine therapy.

AB Restoring bone defects are the major challenge facing clinical trial therapy, particularly skull related problems. Morin, a naturally occurring compound, has pro osteogenesis. This research focuses on assessing the role of morin for its pro osteogenesis activities. We utilized in vivo and in vitro models to investigate the molecular level mechanisms of morin's osteoblastic biological activity. The effectiveness of morin on pro osteogenesis (100 mg/kg/day) was assessed by monitoring modifications in the bone histomorphometry score, the development of immature osteoblasts from mesenchymal stems cells and improvements in the expression of pro osteogenic cytokines in skull defected (SD) mice. Quantitative PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence were studied to investigate the signaling pathways. Morin has a substantial in vivo pro osteogenesis effect which can facilitate the development of osteoblasts, the production of osteoblast related marker genes, and in vitro protein markers for osteoblasts. From a molecular biology standpoint, morin contributes to the development of osteoblasts and stimulation of the Wnt pathway with the activation and translocation of beta catenin nuclei. Our findings from the study revealed that morin may be a beneficial substitute for helping regenerate bone defects.

AB Rosiglitazone (RSG) is a potent drug used in the treatment of insulin resistance; however, it is associated with marked skeletal toxicity. RSG induced osteoporosis may contribute to the promotion of adipogenic differentiation at the expense of osteogenic differentiation in bone marrow stromal cells. The aim of this study was to investigate whether RSG induced bone toxicity can be reversed by combined treatment with all trans retinoic acid (ATRA). We examined different osteogenic markers in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) following treatment with RSG, ATRA, or RSG and ATRA in combination. We examined the effects of RSG and/or ATRA on ectopic bone formation, and dissected the possible molecular mechanisms underlying this process. We found that ATRA or RSG both induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in the MEFs, and that the ATRA induced ALP activity was enhanced by RSG and vice versa. However, only the combination of RSG and ATRA increased the expression of osteopontin and osteocalcin, promoted matrix mineralization, and induced ectopic ossification in MEFs. Mechanistically, we found that the osteogenic differentiation induced by the combination of RSG and ATRA may be mediated partly by suppressing RSG induced adipogenic differentiation and activating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/Smad signaling. On the whole, our findings demonstrate that RSG in combination with ATRA promotes the commitment of MEFs to the osteoblast lineage. Thus, the combination of these two agents may prove to be a promising and novel therapeutic regimen for insulin resistance without skeletal toxicity. It may also be a better strategy with which to prevent RSG induced osteoporosis.

AB Osteoclasts are the sole bone resorbing cells that play an essential role in homeostatic bone remodeling and pathogenic bone destruction such as inflammatory arthritis. Pharmacologically targeting osteoclasts has been a promising approach to alleviating bone disease, but there remains room for improvement in mitigating drug side effects and enhancing cell specificity. Recently, we demonstrated the crucial role of MYC and its downstream effectors in driving osteoclast differentiation. Despite these advances, upstream regulators of MYC have not been well defined. In this study, we identify nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (NRF2), a transcription factor known to regulate the expression of phase II antioxidant enzymes, as a novel upstream regulator of MYC. NRF2 negatively regulates receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) induced osteoclastogenesis through the ERK and p38 signaling mediated suppression of MYC transcription. Furthermore, the ablation of MYC in osteoclasts reverses the enhanced osteoclast differentiation and activity in NRF2 deficiency in vivo and in vitro in addition to protecting NRF2 deficient mice from pathological bone loss in a murine model of inflammatory arthritis. Our findings indicate that this novel NRF2 MYC axis could be instrumental for the fine tuning of osteoclast formation and provides additional ways in which osteoclasts could be therapeutically targeted to prevent pathological bone erosion.

AB Nucleotide binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) is a pattern recognition receptor of the innate immune system. It interacts with serine threonine kinases to induce activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B), which is important for receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) signaling. We tested the idea that NOD2 modulates bone metabolism via an action on osteoclasts (OCs). The absence of NOD2 reduced ovariectomy induced bone loss in mice, and lowered the area and the activity of OCs, by impairing RANKL signaling. It also reduced the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as of NF kappa B DNA binding upon RANKL exposure. NOD2 was found to physically interact with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 1, and this led to increased production of ROS in OCs. Our data suggest that NOD2 contributes to bone loss in estrogen deficiency by elevating ROS levels in OCs.

AB The bone marrow provides a protective environment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells that often allows leukemic stem cells to survive standard chemotherapeutic regimens. Targeting these leukemic stem cells within the bone marrow is critical for preventing relapse. We recently demonstrated that SDF 1, a chemokine abundant in the bone marrow, induces apoptosis in AML cell lines and in patient samples expressing high levels of its receptor, CXCR4. Here we show that a subset of osteoblast lineage cells within the bone marrow can protect AML cells from undergoing apoptosis in response to the SDF 1 naturally present in that location. In co culture systems, osteoblasts at various stages of differentiation protected AML cell lines and patient isolates from SDF 1 induced apoptosis. The differentiation of the osteoblast cell lines, MC3T3 and W 20 17, mediated this protection via a cell contact independent mechanism. In contrast, bone marrow derived mesenchymal cells, the precursors of osteoblasts, induced apoptosis in AML cells via a CXCR4 dependent mechanism and failed to protect AML cells from exogenously added SDF 1. These results indicate that osteoblasts in the process of differentiation potently inhibit the SDF 1 driven apoptotic pathway of CXCR4 expressing AML cells residing in the bone marrow. Drugs targeting this protective mechanism could potentially provide a new approach to treating AML by enhancing the SDF 1 induced apoptosis of AML cells residing within the bone marrow microenvironment.

AB Osteoblasts express two key molecules for osteoclast differentiation, receptor activator of NF .B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), a soluble decoy receptor for RANKL. RANKL induces osteoclastogenesis, while OPG inhibits it by blocking the binding of RANKL to RANK, a cellular receptor of RANKL. OPG deficient (OPG ( / )) mice exhibit severe alveolar bone loss with enhanced bone resorption. WP9QY (W9) peptide binds to RANKL and blocks RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis. W9 is also reported to stimulate bone formation in vivo. Here, we show that treatment with W9 restores alveolar bone loss in OPG ( / ) mice by suppressing osteoclastogenesis and enhancing osteoblastogenesis. Administration of W9 or risedronate, a bisphosphonate, to OPG ( / ) mice significantly decreased the osteoclast number in the alveolar bone. Interestingly, treatment with W9, but not risedronate, enhanced Wnt/ catenin signaling and induced alveolar bone formation in OPG ( / ) mice. Expression of sclerostin, an inhibitor of Wnt/ catenin signaling, was significantly lower in tibiae of OPG ( / ) mice than in wild type mice. Treatment with risedronate recovered sclerostin expression in OPG ( / ) mice, while W9 treatment further suppressed sclerostin expression. Histomorphometric analysis confirmed that bone formation related parameters in OPG ( / ) mice, such as osteoblast number, osteoblast surface and osteoid surface, were increased by W9 administration but not by risedronate administration. These results suggest that treatment of OPG ( / ) mice with W9 suppressed osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting RANKL signaling and enhanced osteoblastogenesis by attenuating sclerostin expression in the alveolar bone. Taken together, W9 may be a useful drug to prevent alveolar bone loss in periodontitis.

AB Interaction of myeloma cells with osteoclasts (OC) can enhance tumor cell expansion through activation of complex signaling transduction networks. Both cells reside in the bone marrow, a hypoxic niche. How OC myeloma interaction in a hypoxic environment affects myeloma cell growth and their response to drug treatment is poorly understood. In this study, we i) cultured myeloma cells in the presence/absence of OCs under normoxia and hypoxia conditions and did protein profiling analysis using reverse phase protein array; ii) computationally developed an Integer Linear Programming approach to infer OC mediated myeloma cell specific signaling pathways under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Our modeling analysis indicated that in the presence OCs, (1) cell growth associated signaling pathways, PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK, were activated and apoptotic regulatory proteins, BAX and BIM, down regulated under normoxic condition; (2) beta 1 Integrin/FAK signaling pathway was activated in myeloma cells under hypoxic condition. Simulation of drug treatment effects by perturbing the inferred cell specific pathways showed that targeting myeloma cells with the combination of PI3K and integrin inhibitors potentially (1) inhibited cell proliferation by reducing the expression/activation of NF kappa B, S6, c Myc, and c Jun under normoxic condition; (2) blocked myeloma cell migration and invasion by reducing the expression of FAK and PKC under hypoxic condition.

AB A role for glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) in controlling bone resorption has been suspected. However uncertainty remains to identify whether GIP act directly on osteoclasts. The aim of the present study were (i) to identify in different osteoclast differentiation models (human peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC, murine bone marrow macrophage BMM and murine Raw 264.7 cells) whether GIP was capable of reducing osteoclast formation and resorption; (ii) ascertain whether the highly potent GIP analogue N AcGIP was capable of inducing a response at lower concentrations and (iii) to decipher the molecular mechanisms responsible for such effects. [D Ala(2)] GIP dose dependently reduced osteoclast formation at concentration as low as 1 nM in human PBMC and 10 nM in murine BMM cultures. Furthermore, [D Ala(2)] GIP also reduced the extent of osteoclast resorption at concentration as low as 1 nM in human PBMC and murine BMM cultures. The mechanism of action of [D Ala(2)] GIP appeared to be mediated by reduction in intracellular calcium concentration and oscillation that subsequently inhibited calcineurin activity and NFATc1 nuclear translocation. The potency of the highly potent N AcGIP was determined and highlighted an effect on osteoclast formation and resorption at concentration ten times lower than observed with [D Ala(2)] GIP in vitro. Furthermore, N AcGIP was also capable of reducing the number of osteoclast in ovariectomized mice as well as the circulating level of type I collagen C telopeptide. Pharmacological concentrations required for reducing osteoclast formation and resorption provide the impetus to design and exploit enzymatically stable GIP analogues for the treatment of bone resorption disorders in humans.

AB Luminal breast cancer has the highest bone metastasis frequency among all breast cancer subtypes; however, its metastatic mechanism has not been elucidated because of a lack of appropriate models. We have previously developed useful bone metastatic cell lines of luminal breast cancer using MCF7 cells. In this study, we characterized bone metastatic MCF7 BM cell lines and identified c Jun as a novel bone metastasis marker of luminal breast cancer. The protein level of c Jun was upregulated in MCF7 BM cells compared with that in parental cells, and its deficiency resulted in the suppression of tumor cell migration, transformation, and reduced osteolytic ability. In vivo, dominant negative c Jun exhibited smaller bone metastatic lesions and a lower metastatic frequency. Histologic analysis revealed that c Jun expression was heteroge neous in bone metastatic lesions, whereas c Jun overexpression mediated a vicious cycle between MCF7 BM cells and osteoclasts by enhancing calcium induced migration and releasing the osteoclast activator BMP5. Pharmacological inhibition of c Jun by the Jun amino terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor JNK IN 8 effectively sup pressed tumorigenesis and bone metastasis in MCF7 BM cells. Furthermore, c Jun downstream signals were specifically correlated with the clinical prognosis of patients with the luminal subtype of breast cancer. Our results illustrate the potential benefits of a therapy that targets c Jun to prevent bone metastasis in luminal breast cancer.Implications: c Jun expression mediates bone metastasis in luminal breast cancer by forming a vicious cycle in the bone microenvironment, which reveals potential strategies for subtype specific bone metastasis therapy.

AB An analogue of the bisphosphonate drug Ibandronate was prepared and coupled via a cleavable ester function to a bromoacetyl linker with specific reactivity for thiol groups. This compound should find useful applications in therapeutic strategies aiming to deliver bisphosphonate drugs specifically to cancer cells making use of proteins as vectors. The specific delivery of bisphosphonates to cancer cells instead of bone, the usual site of accumulation of these cytotoxic drugs, could greatly widen their therapeutic applications.

AB The increased bone remodeling in women after menopause induces an imbalance between bone resorption and formation, leading to decreased bone mass, altered bone microarchitecture, and increased fracture risk. Current antiosteoporotic drugs decrease bone remodeling or increase bone formation. Strontium ranelate (Protelos (R)) is a newly developed antiosteoporotic drug that acts by reducing bone resorption and promoting bone formation, thereby inducing a positive bone balance. In rat and mouse culture models, strontium ranelate enhances preosteoblastic cell replication and bone formation markers. In contrast, it decreases rodent osteoclastic cell resorbing activity and human osteoclast differentiation, and increases rabbit osteoclast apoptosis. In vivo, strontium ranelate increases bone formation and reduces bone resorption in mice, resulting in increased vertebral bone mass. In rats, strontium ranelate increases bone mass and improves microarchitecture and bone geometry, resulting in increased bone resistance. In ovariectomized rats, strontium ranelate decreases bone resorption but maintains high bone formation, resulting in improved bone microarchitecture and increased bone mass and strength. In clinical trials, serum alkaline phosphatase levels increased whereas serum CTX levels simultaneously decreased in patients treated with Protelos versus placebo at all time points. In these trials, histomorphometric analysis of bone biopsies showed that the osteoblast surface and mineral apposition rate increased whereas bone resorption parameters tended to decrease in treated patients compared to the placebo group. These preclinical and clinical data indicate that strontium ranelate acts by increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption, thus rebalancing bone turnover in favour of bone formation, an effect that results in increased bone mass and strength.

AB This study aimed to identify the chemical constituents of Oxalis corniculata L. decoction. Furthermore, the mechanism of action of O corniculata L. decoction in treating osteoarthritis (OA) was investigated utilizing network pharmacology. The chemical composition of the O corniculata L. decoction was analyzed by employing UHPLC Q Exactive MS/MS. Subsequently, a "compound target pathway" network was established through network pharmacology, offering a novel approach to identify the molecular mechanism underlying the treatment of OA with O corniculata L. decoction. Ultimately, the molecular docking technique was employed to validate the binding ability of the active ingredients with therapeutic targets. A total of 539 compounds were identified in O corniculata L. decoction. Topological analysis of the protein protein interaction network indicated that compounds, including guanosine, naringenin 7 O beta D glucuronide, noroxyhydrastinine, and chrysophanol 8 O glucoside, have therapeutic potential for OA. In addition, GAPDH, TNF, TP53, epidermal growth factor receptor, and ESR1 may be key targets for the treatment of OA, primarily involving lipid and atherosclerosis, cellular senescence, IL 17 signaling pathway, and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance signaling pathways. This method preliminarily identified the chemical composition of O corniculata L. decoction and predicted the active ingredients, potential targets, and signaling pathways of O corniculata L. decoction in treating OA. The findings of this research revealed the potential function of O corniculata L. decoction in anti inflammation, alongside its ability to promote osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, providing new ideas for the processing of O corniculata L. herbs and related drug development.

AB Osteoporosis is a class of metabolic bone disease caused by complexed ramifications. Overactivation of osteoclasts due to a sudden decreased estrogen level plays a pivotal role for postmenopausal women suffering from osteoporosis. Therefore, inhibiting osteoclast formation and function has become a major direction for the treatment of osteoporosis. Tiliroside (Tle) is a salutary dietary glycosidic flavonoid extracted from Oriental Paperbush flower, which has been reported to have an anti inflammation effect. However, whether Tle affects the osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption remains unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that Tle prevents bone loss in ovariectomy in mice and inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption stimulated by receptor activator of nuclear factor B ligand (RANKL) in vitro. Molecular mechanism studies reveal that Tle reduces RANKL induced activation of mitogen activated protein kinase and T cell nuclear factor 1 pathways, and osteoclastogenesis related marker gene expression, including cathepsin K (Ctsk), matrix metalloproteinase 9, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (Acp5), and Atp6v0d2. Our research indicates that Tle suppresses osteoclastogenesis and bone loss by downregulating the RANKL mediated signaling protein activation and expression. In addition, Tle inhibits intracellular reactive oxygen species generation which is related to the formation of osteoclasts. Therefore, Tle might serve as a potential drug for osteolytic disease such as osteoporosis.

AB The mevalonate pathway is an important drug target for the treatment of cancer and cardiovascular disease. We synthesized and studied a new type of nitrogen containing bisphosphonate analogs and developed a sensitive end point assay method for enzyme FPPS, which was used for inhibitor screening. One potent FPPS inhibitor was discovered, and the structure activity relationship of bisphosphonates for the enzyme inactivation was studied.

AB The spectrum of arthritis ranges from erosive (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) to ossifying disease with formation of new bone (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis and osteoarthritis). The molecular basis for these different patterns of arthritis had Jong been unclear. In the last few years, however, characterisation of catabolic and anabolic molecular pathways in different forms of arthritis led to a better understanding of joint remodelling and revealed novel therapeutic targets. Recent findings show that catabolic and anabolic molecular pathways govern bone and cartilage remodelling in healthy and arthritic joints. The predominance of catabolic molecular pathways (e.g., receptor activator of nuclear factor KB ligand (RANKL)/RANK and cathepsin K) causes erosive disease whereas anabolic signalling (e.g., Wnt and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)18) favours the formation of new bone including bony spurs and subchondral sclerosis. Other pathways may have a dual function in arthritis (e. g., hedgehog) leading to either catabolic or anabolic joint remodelling dependent on other factors. Key mediators within these signalling pathways may serve as novel targets for treating pathological remodelling of bone and cartilage in arthritis. Molecular pathways govern remodelling processes of bone and cartilage in arthritic joints. Future therapies will likely target the pathologic activity of these molecular pathways to specifically block either catabolic or anabolic joint remodelling in arthritis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI DKK1 activates noncanonical NF κB signaling via IL 6 induced CKAP4

AB Proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib (BTZ), represent the key elements in chemotherapy regimens for multiple myeloma (MM), whereas acquired chemoresistance and ultimately relapse remain a major obstacle. In the current study, we screened differently expressed cytokines in bortezomib resistant MM cells and found that Dickkopf 1 (DKK1) level was remarkably augmented, whereas CD138 level was significantly suppressed. DKK1 in vitro specifically enhanced the resistance of myeloma cells to bortezomib treatment, and excessive DKK1 drove CD138 downregulation via inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling. Notably, DKK1 mainly induced drug resistance in MM cells via the receptor of CKAP4. Mechanistically, CKAP4 transduced DKK1 signal and evoked NF kappa B pathway through recruiting and preventing cullin associated and neddylation dissociated 1 from hampering the assembly of E3 ligase mediated ubiquitination of I kappa B alpha. In addition, we found that interleukin 6 (IL 6) stimulated CKAP4 expression to generate drug resistance, and disturbance of DKK1 CKAP4 axis improved sensitivity to BTZ treatment of MM and attenuated bone destruction in a mouse model. Collectively, our study revealed the previously unidentified role of DKK1 in myeloma drug resistance via Wnt signaling dependent and independent manners, and clarified the importance of antagonism of DKK1 IL 6 loop in bone marrow microenvironment.

AB Bisphosphonates promote apoptosis of cancer cells as well as osteoclasts in bone metastatic sites, but several clinical trials and high concentration treatment have shown that bisphosphonates have side effects that include bone loss and damage to normal cells. The aim of this study was to elucidate the protective effect and the possible mechanism of activated protein C (APC) against bisphosphonate induced cell damage using primary cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). HUVECs were treated with APC mu g/ml) for 1 h, and then treated with bisphosphonates including alendronate, zoledronate and pamidronate. Bisphosphonates induced cell death in HUVECs but the cell death was blocked by treatment with APC. Bisphosphonates markedly induced caspase 3 activation, which was diminished in cells exposed to APC. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP 2) reduction and nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) activation induced by bisphosphonates in HUVECs were also blocked by APC treatment. Furthermore, APC highly induced the expression of the endothelial protein c receptor (EPCR) in HUVEC cells. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that APC inhibits bisphosphonate induced endothelial cell death via EPCR induced inactivation of caspase 3 and NF kappa B, and also suggests that APC has the potential to be a therapeutic drug in various vascular diseases induced by endothelial cell damage.

AB Purpose: Ultra small gold nanoclusters (AuNCs), as emerging fluorescent nanomaterials with excellent biocompatibility, have been widely investigated for in vivo biomedical applications. However, their effects in guiding osteogenic differentiation have not been investigated, which are important for osteoporosis therapy and bone regeneration. Herein, for the first time, lysozyme protected AuNCs (Lys AuNCs) are used to stimulate osteogenic differentiation, which have the potential for the treatment of bone disease.
   Methods: Proliferation of MC3T3E 1 is important for osteogenic differentiation. First, the proliferation rate of MC3T3E 1 was studied by Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8) assays. Signaling pathways of PI3K/Akt play central roles in controlling proliferation throughout the body. The expression of PI3K/Akt was investigated in the presence of lysozyme, and lysozyme protected AuNCs (Lys AuNCs) by Western blot (WB) and intracellular cell imaging to evacuate the osteogenic differentiation mechanisms. Moreover, the formation of osteoclasts (OC) plays a negative role in the differentiation of osteoblasts. Nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony stimulating factor (M CSF) signaling pathways are used to understand the negative influence of the osteogenic differentiation by the investigation of Raw 264.7 cell line. Raw 264.7 (murine macrophage like) cells and NIH/3T3 (mouse fibroblast) cells were treated with tyloxapol, and the cell viability was assessed. Raw 264.7 cells have also been used for in vitro studies, on understanding the osteoclast formation and function. The induced osteoclasts were identified by TRAP confocal fluorescence imaging. These key factors in osteoclast formation, such as (NFATc 1, c Fos, V ATPase 2 and CTSK), were investigated by Western blot.
   Results: Based on the above investigation, Lys AuNCs were found to promote osteogenic differentiation and decrease osteoclast activity. It is noteworthy that the lysozyme (protected template), AuNPs, or the mixture of Lysozyme and AuNPs have negligible effects on osteoblastic differentiation compared to Lys AuNCs.
   Conclusion: This study opens up a novel avenue to develop a new gold nanomaterial for promoting osteogenic differentiation. The possibility of using AuNCs as nanomedicines for the treatment of osteoporosis can be expected.

AB Introduction: The function of promoting bone regeneration of Moutan Cortex (MC), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been widely known but, the effective components of MC in promoting osteoblast mediated bone regeneration were still unclear.Objective: The method of osteoblast membrane bio specific extraction conjugated with HPLC analysis was established to screen bone regeneration active components from MC.Methods: The fingerprints, washing eluate and desorption eluate of MC extract were analyzed by the established HPLC DAD method. The established MC3T3 E1 cells membrane chromatography method was used for the bio specific extraction of MC. The isolated compounds were identified by MS spectrometry. The effects and possible mechanisms of the isolated compounds were evaluated by molecular docking, ALP activity, cell viability by MTT Assay and proteins expression by Western Blot Analysis.Results: The active compound responsible for bone regeneration from MC was isolated using the established method of osteoblast membrane bio specific extraction conjugated with HPLC analysis, and it was identified as 1,2,3,4,6 penta O beta galloyl D glucose (PGG) by MS spectrometry. It was further demonstrated through molecular docking that PGG could fit well into the functional ALP, BMP2, and Samd1 binding pocket. The proliferation of osteoblasts was promoted, the level of ALP was increased, and the protein expression of BMP2 and Smad1 was increased as shown by further pharmacological verification.Conclusion: It was concluded that PGG, the bone regeneration active compound from MC, could stimulate the proliferation of osteoblasts to promote osteoblast differentiation, and its mechanism might be related to the BMP/Smad1 pathway.

AB Purpose: The recombinant fusion protein ipafricept blocks Wnt signaling, and in combination with gemcitabine and nabpaclitaxel caused tumor regression in xenografts. This phase Ib study evaluated the combination of ipafricept with nab paclitaxel+ gemcitabine in patients with untreated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (mPDAC).
   Patients and Methods: Dose escalation started with standard dose nab paclitaxel + gemcitabine and ipafricept (3.5 mg/kg days 1, 15). Because of fragility fractures seen with different antiWnt agents, following cohorts had >= 6 patients treated with ipafricept 3 to 5 mg/ kg on day 1, and included bone marker monitoring and prophylactic bisphosphonates as indicated. On the basis of preclinical data, sequential dosing was evaluated in cohort 4 ( ipafricept day 1 followed nab paclitaxel + gemcitabine day 3). Objectives included safety, MTD, recommended phase II dose, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics,
   Results: A total of 26 patients were enrolled, five in cohort 1 and seven each in cohorts 2 4. ipafricept related adverse events (AEs) of any grade included fatigue, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and pyrexia. ipafricept related AEs grade >= 3 included two events of aspartate aminotransferase elevation, and one each of nausea, rash, vomiting, and leucopenia. No dose limiting toxicities or fragility fractures were observed. Nine patients (34.6%) had partial response, 12 (46.2%) stable disease as best response, with clinical benefit rate of 81%. Median progression free survival was 5.9 m [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.4 18.4], median overall survival was 9.7 m (95% CI, 7.0 14). The study was terminated by the sponsor due to bone related toxicity within this therapeutic program and concerns for commercial viability. One patient remains on therapy under compassionate use.
   Conclusions: Ipafricept can be administeredwith nab paclitaxel+ gemcitabine with reasonable tolerance. Wnt pathway remains a therapeutic target of interest in mPDAC.

AB Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are generally used in multiple biomedical applications. The tissue repair effect of IONPs had been demonstrated in the previous studies of our group, but the underlying mechanism is unclarified. It is well known that stem cell based therapies show promising prospect in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, however, whether IONPs could modulate stem cell fate to promote tissue repair is still unclear. Herein, we found that IONPs could promote osteogenic differentiation of human bone derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) in vitro. To insightfully understand the molecular mechanisms, we performed systematic analyses by use of gene microarray assay and bioinformatics analysis, which revealed that gene expression was widely regulated and classical mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway was activated by IONPs treatment. As a result, downstream genes of this pathway were regulated to promote osteogenic differentiation. In summary, the present study elucidates a molecular basis explaining how IONPs effect on hBMSCs, which could have many meaningful impacts for stem cells application in regenerative medicine.

AB An exciting new era in bone biology is a result of our greater understanding not only of the mechanisms of action of the medications we currently use for treatment of osteoporosis but also of the molecular pathways involved in normal and abnormal bone formation. In the coming years our increased understanding of these molecular pathways will result in many new medications for osteoporosis therapy. Together with the development of new drugs it will be necessary to develop better ways of assessing bone quality. Since bone has both protein (collagen type 1) and mineral (hydroxyapatite) components, both of which are essential to bone strength, measurements of bone mineral content by densitometry (DXA) will provide us with only a narrow perspective on the utility of the drug under development prior to full patient fracture studies. The information gathered from basic bone research must be used for the rational development of agents that increase bone strength within a narrow physiological window.

AB Osteoporosis (OP) has severely affected human health, which is characterized by abnormal differentiation of osteoclasts. Urolithin B (UB), as a potential natural drug, has been reported to exhibit numerous biological activities including antioxidant and anti inflammatory but its effects on OP, especially on RANKL stimulated osteoclast formation and activation, are still understood. In our study, we have demonstrated for the first time that UB inhibits RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation and explored its potential mechanisms of action. The RAW264.7 cells were cultured and induced with RANKL followed by UB treatment. Then, the effects of UB on mature osteoclast differentiation were evaluated by counting tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) positive multinucleated cells and F actin ring analysis. Moreover, the effects of UB on RANKL induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by 2 ', 7 ' dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH DA) staining. Further, we explored the potential mechanisms of these downregulation effects by performing Western blotting and quantitative RT PCR examination. We found that UB represses osteoclastogenesis, F actin belts formation, osteoclast specific gene expressions and ROS activity in a time  and concentration dependent manner. Mechanistically, UB attenuates intracellular ROS levels by upregulation of Nrf2 and other ROS scavenging enzymes activation. Furthermore, UB also inhibited RANKL induced NF kappa B, MAPK and Akt signalling pathway and suppressed expression of c Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1), which is the master transcription factor of osteoclast differentiation. Taken together, our findings confirm that UB is a polyphenolic compound that can be a potential therapeutic treatment for osteoclast related bone diseases such as osteoporosis.

AB Background and ObjectiveDenosumab is widely used for osteoporosis and cancer treatment. However, hypocalcemia induced by denosumab is a frequent adverse event. The objective of this study is to comprehensively investigate the safety signals and the occurrence of hypocalcemia in real world patient cases reported through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).MethodsReports from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2021 were extracted from the FAERS. Only cases of hypocalcemia suspected to denosumab were eligible in pharmacovigilance study. Denosumab related hypocalcemia safety signal were identified to characterize their clinical features. A safety signal for hypocalcemia was evaluated using reporting odds ratios (ROR).ResultsAmong the 102,413 cases related to denosumab, 1042 cases were reported with denosumab related hypocalcemia. The affected patients were mainly elderly (median age 70 years) and male (n = 568, 63.5%). In available data, the median onset time of 23 (range 0 1601) days. Most patients required drug interruption (n = 226, 72.9%) and can achieve a recovered resolved state (n = 318, 62.1%). For the whole database, denosumab exhibited a safety signal for hypocalcemia (ROR = 14.09, 95% Cl 13.18, 15.06). In the sensitivity analyses, denosumab also showed a safety signal for hypocalcemia in cancer (ROR = 21.28, 95% Cl 18.79, 24.11) and osteoporosis (ROR = 9.29, 95% Cl 6.80, 12.59). Compared with bisphosphonates, denosumab still has safety signal for hypocalcemia (ROR = 1.88, 95% Cl 1.67, 2.11).ConclusionsThis pharmacovigilance database analysis indicates a high safety signal for hypocalcemia associated with denosumab, particularly in cancer patients.

This is attributed to increased RANKL production and impaired osteoprotegerin synthesis. Fast bone loss leads to trabecular perforations, dramatic diminution of bone strength, and unexpected fractures. To avoid osteoporotic fractures, elimination of fast bone loss is recommended. Antiosteoclastic drugs, apart from estrogens, are the selective estrogen receptor modulators, calcitonins, and amino bisphosphonates. These drugs increase bone mass by 1 5%, but reduce the relative risk of a vertebral fracture by 30 70%. Long term exposure to bisphosphonates may be related to low bone turnover. In elderly and severe osteoporosis, antiosteoclastic regimens hardly correct the depressed osteoblastic function. Intermittent teriperatide stimulates osteoblastic function, improves bone geometry, and has an additional analgesic effect. While both anticatabolic and anabolic agents increase bone mass and decrease the risk of spinal fractures and occasionally of the fracture of the femoral neck, there are differences in the mode of their action. These pathophysiological differences are tentative therapeutic tools for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures. A fast bone loss, associated with increased biochemical markers, is the main indicator for anticatabolic agents, while impaired bone geometry, normal or low bone markers, and established bone architectural changes are in favor of the anabolic agents. Strontium ranelate combines the anticatabolic effect with an additional anabolic action.

AB Background As the incidence of secretory osteoporosis has increased, bone loss, osteoporosis and their relationships with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) have received increased attention. In this study, the role of TSH in bone metabolism and its possible underlying mechanisms were investigated. Methods We analyzed the serum levels of free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), and TSH and the bone mineral density (BMD) levels of 114 men with normal thyroid function. In addition, osteoblasts from rat calvarial samples were treated with different doses of TSH for different lengths of time. The related gene and protein expression levels were investigated. Results A comparison of the BMD between the high level and low level serum TSH groups showed that the TSH serum concentration was positively correlated with BMD. TSH at concentrations of 10 mU/mL and 100 mU/mL significantly increased the mRNA levels of ALP, COI1 and Runx2 compared with those of the control (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)2 activity was enhanced with both increased TSH concentration and increased time. The protein levels of Runx2 and osterix were increased in a dose dependent manner. Conclusions The circulating concentrations of TSH and BMD were positively correlated with normal thyroid function in males. TSH promoted osteoblast proliferation and differentiation in rat primary osteoblasts.

AB Glucocorticoids (GCs) are potent anti inflammatory drugs, but their use is limited by their adverse effects on the skeleton. Compound A (CpdA) is a novel GC receptor modulator with the potential for an improved risk/benefit profile. We tested the effects of CpdA on bone in a mouse model of GC induced bone loss. Bone loss was induced in FVB/N mice by implanting slow release pellets containing either vehicle, prednisolone (PRED) (3.5 mg), or CpdA (3.5 mg). After 4 weeks, mice were killed to examine the effects on the skeleton using quantitative computed tomography, bone histomorphometry, serum markers of bone turnover, and gene expression analysis. To assess the underlying mechanisms, in vitro studies were performed with human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and murine osteocyte like cells (MLO Y4 cells). PRED reduced the total and trabecular bone density in the femur by 9% and 24% and in the spine by 11% and 20%, respectively, whereas CpdA did not influence these parameters. Histomorphometry confirmed these results and further showed that the mineral apposition rate was decreased by PRED whereas the number of osteoclasts was increased. Decreased bone formation was paralleled by a decline in serum procollagen type 1 N terminal peptide (P1NP), reduced skeletal expression of osteoblast markers, and increased serum levels of the osteoblast inhibitor dickkopf 1 (DKK 1). In addition, serum CTX 1 and the skeletal receptor activator of NFkB ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) ratio were increased by PRED. None of these effects were observed with CpdA. Consistent with the in vivo data, CpdA did not increase the RANKL/OPG ratio in MLO Y4 cells or the expression of DKK 1 in bone tissue, BMSCs, and osteocytes. Finally, CpdA also failed to transactivate DKK 1 expression in bone tissue, BMSCs, and osteocytes. This study underlines the bone sparing potential of CpdA and suggests that by preventing increases in the RANKL/OPG ratio or DKK 1 in osteoblast lineage cells, GC induced bone loss may be ameliorated.

TI Enhancement of experimental fracture healing by systemic administration
   of recombinant human parathyroid hormone (PTH 1 34)

AB Background: Recombinant human parathyroid hormone (PTH [1 34]; teriparatide) is a new treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis that can be systemically administered for the primary purpose of increasing bone formation. Because several studies have described the enhancement of fracture healing and osteointegration in animals after use of PTH, we sought to critically analyze this skeletal effect.
   Methods: Two hundred and seventy male Sprague Dawley rats underwent standard, closed femoral fractures and were divided into three groups that were administered daily subcutaneous injections of 5 or 30 mu g/kg of PTH (1 34) or vehicle (control). The dosing was administered for up to thirty five days. Groups were further divided into three subgroups and were killed on day 21, 35, or 84 after the fracture. The bones were subjected to mechanical torsion testing, histomorphometric analysis, or microquantitative computed tomography.
   Results: By day 21, calluses from the group treated with 30 mu g of PTH showed significant increases over the controls with respect to torsional strength, stiffness, bone mineral content, bone mineral density, and cartilage volume. By day 35, both groups treated with PTH showed significant increases in bone mineral content and density and total osseous tissue volume, and they demonstrated significant decreases in void space and cartilage volume (p < 0.05). Torsional strength was significantly increased at this time point in the group treated with 30 mu g of PTH (p < 0.05). While dosing was discontinued on day 35, analyses performed after eighty four days in the group treated with 30 mu g of PTH showed sustained increases over the controls with respect to torsional strength and bone mineral density. No change was noted in osteoclast density at the time points measured, suggesting that treatment with PTH enhanced bone formation but did not induce bone resorption.
   Conclusions: These data show that daily systemic administration of PTH (1 34) enhances fracture healing by increasing bone mineral content and density and strength, and it produces a sustained anabolic effect throughout the remodeling phase of fracture healing.
   Clinical Relevance: A systemically administered drug that enhances bone repair could have widespread applications to promote the healing of fractures and arthrodesis sites and to promote osteointegration in porous implants. PTH (1 34) is the first bone formation agent shown to be effective for the systemic treatment of a bone disease and may represent an attractive new modality for the management of these musculoskeletal conditions.

AB Natural compounds are alternative agents that have therapeutic potential for preventing and treating osteoporosis. Traditionally, sanguinarine has been used clinically due to its diverse biological properties, including antimicrobial, anti inflammatory and anticancer effects. Recently, for the first time, it was reported that sanguinarine inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption by suppressing the tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 11 induced nuclear factor kappa B and extracellular signal regulated kinase signaling pathways in vitro. Therefore, the present study further investigated the pharmacological effect of sanguinarine on osteoporosis in vivo. Micro computed tomography and histomorphometry analysis demonstrated that sanguinarine, at low and high concentrations, prevents ovariectomy (OVX)  induced bone loss. In addition, further investigation of the cellular response in vivo revealed that sanguinarine inhibited osteoclastic bone resorption and promoted osteoblastic bone formation in a dose dependent manner. Therefore, the present study demonstrated that sanguinarine protected mice from OVX induced osteoporosis by modulating bone remodeling, indicating that sanguinarine may have potential in the treatment of osteoporosis.

AB One of the effective therapeutic strategies to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) related bone resorption is to target excessive activation of osteoclasts. We discovered that 6 O angeloylplenolin (6 OAP), a pseudoguaianolide from Euphorbia thymifolia Linn widely used for the treatment of RA in traditional Chinese medicine, could inhibit RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in both RAW264.7 cells and BMMs from 1 mu M and protect a collagen induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model from bone destruction in vivo. The severity of arthritis and bone erosion observed in paw joints and the femurs of the CIA model were attenuated by 6 OAP administered at both dosages (1 or 5 mg/kg, i.g.). BMD, Tb.N and BV/TV were also improved by 6 OAP treatment. Histological analysis and TRAP staining of femurs further confirmed the protective effects of 6 OAP on bone erosion, which is mainly due to reduced osteoclasts. Molecular docking indicated that c Src might be a target of 6 OAP and phosphorylation of c Src was suppressed by 6 OAP treatment. CETSA and SPR assay further confirmed the potential interaction between 6 OAP and c Src. Three signaling molecules downstream of c Src that are vital to the differentiation and function of osteoclasts, NF xB, c Fos and NFATc1, were also suppressed by 6 OAP in vitro. In summary, the results demonstrated that the function of c Src was disrupted by 6 OAP, which led to the suppression of downstream signaling vital to osteoclast differentiation and function. In conclusion, 6OAP has the potential to be further developed for the treatment of RA related bone erosion.

AB Background
   Icariin, a major active flavonoid glucoside, is widely used for the treatment of bone injury and rebuilding in the clinic because of its roles in suppressing osteoblastogenesis and promoting osteogenesis. The senescence accelerated mouse SAMP6 was accepted as a useful murine model to reveal the mechanism of senile osteoporosis and the therapeutic mechanism of drug activity. However, little is known about the characteristics of SAMP6 osteoblasts and the associated regulatory roles of icariin.
   Methods
   We isolated and cultured osteoblasts from SAMP6 or SAMR1 mice and compared their proliferation, migration, and differentiation by performing the CCK 8 assay, cell counting assay, EdU staining, cell cycle analysis, ALP staining and activity measurement, Alizarin red staining, and RT qPCR analysis to measure the levels of osteoblast markers, including RUNX2, Colla1 and Oc. To assess the effects of icariin on BMP 2 induced osteoblast differentiation, after BMP 2 treatment, osteoblast markers were analyzed by RT qPCR and semi quantitative Western blotting. The effects of icariin on connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were measured by RT qPCR. shRNA targeting CTGF mRNA was employed to knockdown its expression level in osteoblasts.
   Results
   The SAMP6 osteoblasts presented decreased the development and differentiation activity compared with SAMR1 osteoblasts, indicating that they are the potential mechanisms under lying age associated disease. Moreover, SAMP6 osteoblasts presented upregulated CTGF compared with SAMR1 osteoblasts. lcariin enhanced BMP 2 induced osteoblast differentiation by downregulating CTGF expression, which tightly regulates osteoblast differentiation.
   Conclusion
   These results suggest that decreased osteoblast development and function potentially contributes to age associated disease. Icariin exerts enhancing effects on BMP 2 mediated osteoblast development via downregulating CTGF.

AB The antigen I/II (AgI/II) protein is a major surface protein that mediates the attachment of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) to the saliva coated pellicle. Numerous studies have investigated not only the mechanisms by which AgI/II signaling is transduced within cells, but have also attempted to use AgI/II specific antibodies to treat dental caries and host immune responses. However, little information is available about the effects of AgI/II on basic cellular events in bone cells. In this study, we examined the effects of the His tagged recombinant N terminal half of the AgI/II protein (rAgI/II N) generated from S. mutans GS 5 on the viability, proliferation, and cell cycle progression of primary calvarial osteoblasts. We also investigated the mechanisms involved in the rAgI/II N mediated survival of serum starved osteoblasts. We found that rAgI/II treatment attenuated the serum deprivation induced decrease in cell viability and proliferation of osteoblasts. rAgI/II N also prevented the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), alterations in levels of two key mitochondrial Bcl 2 family proteins, and the accumulation of numerous cells into the sub G1 phase that were observed in serum starved osteoblasts. Pharmacological inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K), but not of extracellular signal regulated kinase or Ras, blocked the rAgI/II N mediated protection against serum deprivation induced cell death. Additional experiments revealed that the integrin a5 beta 1 mediated PI3K pathway is required for rAgI/II N mediated Akt phosphorylation in osteoblasts. Collectively, these results suggest that rAgI/II N induces survival signals in serum starved osteoblasts through integrin induced PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. J. Cell. Biochem. 113: 17241732, 2012.

TI Aberrant Fluid Shear Stress Contributes to Articular Cartilage
   Pathogenesis via Epigenetic Regulation of ZBTB20 by H3K4me3

AB Purpose: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disease for human beings, characterized by severe inflammation, cartilage degradation, and subchondral bone destruction. However, current therapies are limited to relieving pain or joint replacement and no effective treatment methods have been discovered to improve degenerative changes. Currently, a variety of evidences have indicated that aberrant mechanical stimuli is closely associated with articular joint pathogenesis, while the detailed underlying mechanism remains unelucidated. In the present study, we determined to investigate the impact of excessive high fluid shear stress (FSS) on primary chondrocytes and the underlying epigenetic mechanisms. Materials and Methods: Phalloidin staining and EdU staining were used to evaluate cell morphology and viability. The mRNA level and protein level of genes were determined by qPCR, Western blot assay, and immunofluorescence staining. Mechanistic investigation was performed through RNA sequencing and CUT&Tag sequencing. In vivo, we adopted uni lateral anterior crossbites (UAC) mice model to investigate the expression of H3K4me3 and ZBTB20 in aberrant force related cartilage pathogenesis. Results: The results demonstrated that FSS greatly disrupts cell morphology and signifi cantly decreased chondrocyte viability. Aberrant FSS induces remarkable inflammatory mediators production, leading to cartilage degeneration and degradation. In depth mechan istic study showed that FSS results in more than 10 fold upregulation of H3K4me3, and the modulatory effect of H3K4me3 on cartilage was obtained by directly targeting ZBTB20. Furthermore, Wnt signaling was strongly activated in high FSS induced OA pathogenesis, and the negative impact of ZBTB20 on chondrocytes was also achieved through activating Wnt signaling pathway. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of H3K4me3 activation by MM 102 or treatment with Wnt pathway inhibitor LF3 could effectively alleviate the destructive effect of FSS on chondrocytes. In vivo UAC mice model validated the dysregu lation of H3K4me3 and ZBTB20 in aberrant force induced cartilage pathogenesis. Conclusion: Through the combination of in vitro FSS model and in vivo UAC model, KMT2B H3K4me3 ZBTB20 axis was first identified in aberrant FSS induced cartilage pathogenesis, which may provide evidences for epigenetic based therapy in the future.

AB The imbalance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts is the cause of osteoporosis. Milk derived extracellular vesicles (mEVs), excellent drug delivery nanocarriers, can promote bone formation and inhibit bone resorption. In this study, we conjugated bone targeting peptide (AspSerSer, DSS)6 to mEVs by click chemistry and then loaded with SRT2104, a SIRT1 (silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1) agonist that was proofed to help reduce bone loss. The engineered (DSS)6 mEV SRT2104 had the intrinsic anti osteoporosis function of mEVs and SRT2104 to reverse the imbalance in bone homeostasis by simultaneously regulating osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, we labelled mEVs with MnB nanoparticles that can be used for the in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visualization. The obtained nanocomposites significantly prevented bone loss in osteoporosis mice and increased bone mineral density, exhibiting superior bone accumulation under MRI. We believe the proposed (DSS)6 mEV SRT2104/MnB provides a novel paradigm for osteoporosis treatment and monitoring.

AB Simple Summary
   Adult T cell leukemia (ATL) Leukemia is an aggressive, peripheral blood (T cell) neoplasm associated with human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV 1) infection. Recent studies have implicated dysregulated histone deacetylases in ATL pathogenesis. ATL modulates the bone microenvironment of patients and activates osteoclasts (bone resorbing cells) that cause severe bone loss. The objective of this study was to assess the individual and dual effects of AR 42 (HDACi) and zoledronic acid (Zol) on the growth of ATL cells in vitro and in vivo. AR 42 and Zol reduced the viability of ATL cells in vitro. Additionally, Zol and Zol/AR 42 decreased ATL tumor growth and halted osteolysis in bone tumor xenografts in immunodeficient mice in vivo. Our study suggests that dual targeting of ATL cells (using HDACi) and bone osteoclasts (using bisphosphonates) may be exploited as a valuable approach to reduce bone tumor burden and improve the life quality of ATL patients.
   Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an intractable disease affecting nearly 4% of Human T cell Leukemia Virus Type 1 (HTLV 1) carriers. Acute ATL has a unique interaction with bone characterized by aggressive bone invasion, osteolytic metastasis, and hypercalcemia. We hypothesized that dual tumor and bone targeted therapies would decrease tumor burden in bone, the incidence of metastasis, and ATL associated osteolysis. Our goal was to evaluate dual targeting of both ATL bone tumors and the bone microenvironment using an anti tumor HDACi (AR 42) and an osteoclast inhibitor (zoledronic acid, Zol), alone and in combination. Our results showed that AR 42, Zol, and AR 42/Zol significantly decreased the viability of multiple ATL cancer cell lines in vitro. Zol and AR 42/Zol decreased tumor growth in vivo. Zol +/  AR 42 significantly decreased ATL associated bone resorption and promoted new bone formation. AR 42 treated ATL cells had increased mRNA levels of PTHrP, ENPP2 (autotaxin) and MIP 1 alpha, and TAX viral gene expression. AR 42 alone had no significant effect on tumor growth or osteolysis in mice. These findings indicate that Zol adjuvant therapy has the potential to reduce growth of ATL in bone and its associated osteolysis.

AB Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) is a critical regulator of skeletal homeostasis and has diverse effects on osteoblastogenesis. To date, the mechanisms behind the intriguing inhibitory effect of TGF beta 1 on osteoblast maturation are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which TGF beta 1 modulates osteoblast maturation through the lysosomal protease legumain. We observed that addition of TGF beta 1 to osteogenic cultures of human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells enhanced legumain activity and secretion, in spite of decreased legumain mRNA expression, suggesting post transcriptional regulation. We further showed that osteogenic cells internalize and activate prolegumain, associated with inhibited osteoblast maturation, revealing legumain as a paracrine regulator of osteoblast maturation. Interestingly, TGF beta 1 treatment exacerbated legumain internalization and activity, and showed an additive effect on legumain induced inhibition of osteoblast maturation. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of legumain abolished the inhibitory effect of TGF beta 1 on osteoblast maturation. Our findings reveal that TGF beta 1 inhibits osteoblast maturation by stimulating secretion and activity of endogenous legumain, as well as enhancing internalization and activation of extracellular prolegumain. Therefore, our study provides a deeper understanding of the complex regulation of osteoblastogenesis and unveils a novel TGF beta 1 legumain axis in regulation of osteoblast maturation, offering novel insights for possible therapeutic interventions related to bone diseases associated with aberrant TGF beta 1 signaling.

AB Identifying the subcellular localization of a protein within a cell is often an essential step in understanding its function. The main objective of this report was to determine the presence of the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) in healthy human cells of skeletal system, specifically osteoblasts (OBs), chondrocytes (Chs) and intervertebral disc (IVD) cells. This receptor is a member of the ATP gated ion channel family, known to be a main sensor of extracellular ATP, the prototype of the danger signal released at sites of tissue damage, and a ubiquitous player in inflammation and cancer, including bone and cartilaginous tissues. Despite overwhelming data supporting a role in immune cell responses and tumor growth and progression, a complete picture of the pathophysiological functions of P2X7R, especially when expressed by non immune cells, is lacking. Here we show that human wild type P2X7R (P2X7A) was expressed in different samples of human osteoblasts, chondrocytes and intervertebral disc cells. By fluorescence microscopy (LM) and immunogold transmission electron microscopy we localized P2X7R not only in the canonical sites (plasma membrane and cytoplasm), but also in the nucleus of all the 3 cell types, especially IVD cells and OBs. P2X7R mitochondrial immunoreactivity was predominantly detected in OBs and IVD cells, but not in Chs. Evidence of subcellular localization of P2X7R may help to i. understand the participation of P2X7R in as yet unidentified signaling pathways in the joint and bone microenvironment, ii. identify pathologies associated with P2X7R mislocalization and iii. design specific targeted therapies.

AB The continuing investigation of SAR of 3 aminothieno[2,3 b]pyridine 2 carboxamide derivatives has been described. In this study, C4 piperidine derivatives with polar functional groups were synthesized to develop orally available bone anabolic agents. The optimized compound 9o (DS96432529), which exhibited the best PK profile and high in vitro activity, showed the highest in vivo efficacy in this series. Moreover, significant synergistic effects were observed following co administration of DS96432529 and alendronate or parathyroid hormone. The mechanism of action is most likely mediated through CDK8 inhibition.

AB Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent progenitor cells that can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. The importance of epigenetic regulation for osteogenic differentiation of MSCs is widely accepted. However, the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that histone H3K9 acetyltransferase PCAF plays a critical role in osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Knockdown of PCAF significantly reduced the bone formation both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, PCAF controls BMP signaling genes expression by increasing H3K9 acetylation. Most importantly, PCAF expression is significantly decreased in bone sections of ovariectomized or aged mice. Histone modification enzyme is chemically modifiable; therefore, PCAF may represent a novel therapeutic target for stem cell mediated regenerative medicine and the treatment of osteoporosis.

AB Aurantiamide acetate (AA) is a naturally occurring dipeptide with known anti inflammatory, analgesic, and antioxidant properties. To identify its new target proteins and medicinal pathways, the potential AA targets with high pharmacophore matching scores were selected from a library of 2,241 human disease related proteins through reverse target screening. The results showed that AA acts on cathepsin K (CTSK) and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9). Then the network pharmacological properties of the top 10 potential AA targets were analyzed, CTSK and MMP9 were identified as the major proteins in the protein interaction network, and gene enrichment analysis showed that both proteins were closely related to biological processes and signaling pathways associated with the regulation of osteoporosis. In addition, the binding energy and molecular interaction pattern between AA and CTSK or MMP9 were predicted by molecular docking analysis. Finally, through in vitro experiments, it was demonstrated that AA significantly inhibited osteoclast differentiation, and expression of CTSK and MMP9 proteins in osteoclasts. In conclusion, this study identified AA as an inhibitor of CTSK and MMP9, and has the potential for the treatment of osteoporosis.

AB Nacre is a widely used mineral medicine that has been reported to have beneficial effects in bone remodeling without an increase in inflammation. Water soluble nacre matrix has been demonstrated to be responsible for the effect, yet core active ingredients are unknown. Pinctada fucata mantle gene 1 (PFMG1) was first discovered in the mantle tissue of Pinctada fucata. The protein has 2 EF hands, a calcium binding domain. PFMG1 protein can affect the growth of calcium carbonate crystals in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that PFMG1 affects cell cycle distribution and promotes preosteoblast proliferation. PFMG1 accelerates preosteoblast differentiation and extracellular matrix mineralization. During the differentiation process, PFMG1 increases the expression level of osteoblastic marker genes and activates the Erk signaling pathway. PFMG1 also accelerates calcium crystal aggregation in culture medium and suppresses osteoclast formation. Moreover, PFMG1 prevents bone loss caused by ovariectomy. RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that PFMG1 stimulates genes that are associated with tissue development and ossification, which indicated new genes that function in bone remodeling. Our findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of PFMG1 from nacre as a novel medicine for osteoporosis.

AB BackgroundBone is continuously produced by osteoblasts and resorbed by osteoclasts to maintain homeostasis. Impaired bone resorption by osteoclasts causes bone diseases such as osteoporosis and arthritis. Most pharmacological treatment of osteoporosis focuses on inhibiting osteoclast differentiation, often to restore osteoclast/osteoclast balance. However, recent osteoporosis treatments have various side effects. According to a recent study, resveratrol, known as a stilbenoid family, is known to increase bone density, and the osteoclast inhibitory effect was confirmed using oxyresveratrol, a stilbenoid family. Here, we investigated the effect of oxyresveratrol on osteoclast differentiation and an ovariectomized mouse model.MethodsMouse leukemia monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was treated with oxyresveratrol, and cell cytotoxicity was confirmed by measuring MTT assay. Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), an enzyme marker for osteoclasts, was confirmed by staining. In addition, osteoclast differentiation markers and MAPK related markers were confirmed at the mRNA level and protein expression. The effect of oxyresveratrol was confirmed using ovariectomized mice. Deoxypyridinoline (DPD) was measured using mouse urine and TRAP activity was observed using serum. Bone mineral density was also measured using Micro CT.ResultsThe polyphenol oxyresveratrol inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa Beta ligand (RANKL) induced osteoclast differentiation of RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, oxyresveratrol inhibited TRAP activity and actin ring formation. Moreover, oxyresveratrol suppressed the phosphorylation of the RANKL induced mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) p38, JNK, and ERK and significantly reduced the expression of bone differentiation markers (NFATc1, cathepsin K, and TRAP).ConclusionOxyresveratrol inhibits osteoclast differentiation via MAPK and increases bone density in ovariectomized rats, suggesting it has therapeutic potential for bone diseases such as osteoporosis. We confirmed the osteoporosis prevention effect of OR in Raw 264.7 cells, and future studies should confirm the effect of OR using rat bone marrow derived cells.

AB A high proportion of patients with breast cancer develop bone metastases, yet data on routine treatment with bone targeted agents (BTA) are rare. We report real life outcome data of patients with breast cancer metastasised to the bone treated by office based oncologists in Germany.
   The ongoing, prospective, multicentre, population based cohort study Tumour Registry Breast Cancer (TMK) was started in 2007 in 140 centres across Germany.
   This interim analysis of 1094 patients with bone metastases revealed differences among the tumour subtypes: at start of first line therapy, 36% of the patients with hormone receptor (HR) positive and only 20% of the patients with HR negative tumours presented with bone only metastasis. The majority of patients with bone metastases (89%, n = 976) received BTA therapy. In 2014 2015, 37% of the patients received the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid and 36% the antibody denosumab. Median duration of BTA therapy was 20 months (interquartile range 31.5 months), starting a median of 3 weeks after diagnosis of bone metastases, and ending a median of 7 weeks before death. The median overall survival (OS) also varied among the types of metastasis at start of first line therapy ranging from 54 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 37.6 70.8), 38 months (95% CI 29.4 44.2) to 28 months (95% CI 24.2 31.0) for patients with bone only metastases, non visceral with or without bone metastases and visceral with or without bone metastases respectively.
   We show that choice and duration of BTA therapies are in conformity with guidelines applicable in Germany. To our knowledge, this is the first presentation of data on incidence, metastatic pattern, treatment and survival of patients with bone metastases in routine practice. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

AB Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are efficacious analgesics that contribute to preventive and multimodal analgesic techniques. They are widely used for routine surgeries in cats and dogs and there is some evidence that it is advantageous to give NSAIDs before the start of surgery, rather than in the postoperative period. Despite their efficacy, the side effects of NSAIDs should always be taken into consideration when deciding whether to administer them to a particular patient. The kidney is a particularly vulnerable organ during anaesthesia, due to the high prevalence of hypotension in anaesthetised patients; the administration of a NSAID preoperatively means that it is imperative to monitor and support blood pressure during anaesthesia to prevent renal compromise on recovery. This article summarises the mechanism of action of NSAIDs and provides guidance for practitioners on their use in the perioperative period.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Postmenopausal osteoporosis is one of the most common disorders in women after menopause, which is linked to an estrogen deficiency and characterized by an excessive loss of trabecular bone. Rubus coreanus and Astragalus membranaceus have been used for their various pharmacological properties in Asia as a traditional medicine. The present study evaluated the anti osteoporotic effects of the optimal combination of Rubus coreanus and Astragalus membranaceus in 7:3 mixture (RAM) in ovariectomized (OVX) mice by investigating bone biomechanical properties and the serum levels of TNF alpha, osteocalcin, RANKL, OPG, and RANK RANKL signal related osteoclast differentiation markers.
   Materials and methods: A total of 36 mature female outbred ICR (Institute of cancer research) strain mice (7 weeks) were divided into 6 groups with 7 mice in each group as follows: (1) Sham operated control mice (Sham) received daily oral phosphate buffered saline (PBS) of equal volumes through gavage. (2) OVX mice received a daily oral gavage of PBS (OVX). (3) OVX mice were treated daily with 50 mg/kg b.w./day of RAM (4) with 100 mg/kg b.w./day of RAM or (5) with 200 mg/kg b.w./day of RAM via oral gavage. (6) OVX mice received i.p. injections of 17 beta estradiol (E2) (0.1 mg/kg b.w./day) three times per week for 12 weeks.
   Results: Micro CT images showed that oral administration of RAM to OVX mice prevented tibial bone loss, preserved trabecular bone microarchitecture, and improved bone biomechanical properties. RAM administration also showed recovery effects on the levels of TNF alpha, OPG and RANKL concentration in OVX states. Additionally, we found that the mechanism by which RAM elicited anti osteoporotic effects was by down regulating the expression of TRAF6 and NFATc1 in RANKL RANK pathway, a route of osteoclast differentiation, followed by reducing the production of osteoclast differentiation factors, calcitonin receptors and cathepsin K.
   Conclusions: Our research strongly suggests that RAM can be clinically used in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Ligation of TLR5 Promotes Myeloid Cell Infiltration and Differentiation

AB Our aim was to examine the impact of TLR5 ligation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and experimental arthritis pathology. Studies were conducted to investigate the role of TLR5 ligation on RA and mouse myeloid cell chemotaxis or osteoclast formation, and in addition, to uncover the significance of TNF alpha function in TLR5 mediated pathogenesis. Next, the in vivo mechanism of action was determined in collagen induced arthritis (CIA) and local joint TLR5 ligation models. Last, to evaluate the importance of TLR5 function in RA, we used anti TLR5 Ab therapy in CIA mice. We show that TLR5 agonist, flagellin, can promote monocyte infiltration and osteoclast maturation directly through myeloid TLR5 ligation and indirectly via TNF alpha production from RA and mouse cells. These two identified TLR5 functions are potentiated by TNF alpha, because inhibition of both pathways can more strongly impair RA synovial fluid driven monocyte migration and osteoclast differentiation compared with each factor alone. In preclinical studies, flagellin postonset treatment in CIA and local TLR5 ligation in vivo provoke homing and osteoclastic development of myeloid cells, which are associated with the TNF alpha cascade. Conversely, CIA joint inflammation and bone erosion are alleviated when TLR5 function is blocked. We found that TLR5 and TNF alpha pathways are interconnected, because TNF alpha is produced by TLR5 ligation in RA myeloid cells, and anti TNF alpha therapy can markedly suppress TLR5 expression in RA monocytes. Our novel findings demonstrate that a direct and an indirect mechanism are involved in TLR5 driven RA inflammation and bone destruction.

AB Currently, implant associated bacterial infections account for most hospital acquired infections in patients suffering from bone fractures or defects. Poor osseointegration and aggravated osteolysis remain great challenges for the success of implants in infectious scenarios. Consequently, developing an effective surface modification strategy for implants is urgently needed. Here, a novel nanoplatform (GO/Ga) consisting of graphene oxide (GO) and gallium nanoparticles (GaNPs) was reported, followed by investigations of its in vitro antibacterial activity and potential bacterium inactivation mechanisms, cytocompatibility and regulatory actions on osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. In addition, the possible molecular mechanisms underlying the regulatory effects of GO/Ga nanocomposites on osteoblast differentiation and osteoclast formation were clarified. Moreover, an in vivo infectious microenvironment was established in a rat model of implant related femoral osteomyelitis to determine the therapeutic efficacy and biosafety of GO/Ga nanocomposites. Our results indicate that GO/Ga nanocomposites with excellent antibacterial potency have evident osteogenic potential and inhibitory effects on osteoclast differentiation by modulating the BMP/Smad, MAPK and NF KB signaling pathways. The in vivo experiments revealed that the administration of GO/Ga nanocomposites significantly inhibited bone infections, reduced osteolysis, promoted osseointegration located in implant bone interfaces, and resulted in satisfactory biocompatibility. In summary, this synergistic therapeutic system could accelerate the bone healing process in implant associated infections and can significantly guide the future surface modification of implants used in bacteria infected environments.

AB Bone erosion is the most evident pathological condition of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is the main cause of joint deformities and disability in RA patients. At present, the conventional RA drugs have not achieved satisfactory effect in improving bone erosion. ZhiJingSan (ZJS), which is a traditional Chinese prescription composed of scolopendra (dried body of Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans L. Koch, scolopendridae) and scorpion (dried body of Buthus martensii Karsch, Buthus), exhibits anti rheumatism, analgesic and joint deformities improvement effects. This study aimed to assess the therapeutic effect of ZJS on RA bone erosion and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. The effect of ZJS on RA bone erosion was investigated in a murine model of bovine collagen induced arthritis (CIA), and the underlying mechanism was investigated in vitro in an osteoclast differentiation cell model. Administration of ZJS delayed the onset of arthritis, alleviated joint inflammation, and attenuated bone erosion in the CIA mice. Meanwhile, ZJS decreased the serum levels of TNF alpha, IL 6, and anti bovine collagen II specific antibodies. Furthermore, ZJS treatment reduced the number of osteoclasts and the expression of cathepsin K in the ankle joints of CIA mice. ZJS also inhibited receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand (RANKL) induced osteoclast differentiation and the expression of MMP9 and cathepsin K in vitro. Mechanistically, ZJS blocked RANKL induced p65 phosphorylation, nucleation, and inhibited the expression of downstream NFATc1 and c Fos in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs). Taken together, ZJS exerts a therapeutic effect on bone erosion in CIA mice by inhibiting RANKL/NF kappa B mediated osteoclast differentiation, which suggested that ZJS is a promising prescription for treating RA bone erosion.

AB Understanding the mechanisms regulating recruitment of human skeletal (stromal or mesenchymal) stem cells (hMSC) to sites of tissue injury is a prerequisite for their successful use in cell replacement therapy. Chemokine like protein TAFA2 is a recently discovered neurokine involved in neuronal cell migration and neurite outgrowth. Here, we demonstrate a possible role for TAFA2 in regulating recruitment of hMSC to bone fracture sites. TAFA2 increased the in vitro trans well migration and motility of hMSC in a dose dependent fashion and induced significant morphological changes including formation of lamellipodia as revealed by high content image analysis at single cell level. Mechanistic studies revealed that TAFA2 enhanced hMSC migration through activation of the Rac1 p38 pathway. In addition, TAFA2 enhanced hMSC proliferation, whereas differentiation of hMSC toward osteoblast and adipocyte lineages was not altered. in vivo studies demonstrated transient upregulation of TAFA2 gene expression during the inflammatory phase of fracture healing in a closed femoral fracture model in mice, and a similar pattern was observed in serum levels of TAFA2 in patients after hip fracture. Finally, interleukin 1 was found as an upstream regulator of TAFA2 expression. Our findings demonstrate that TAFA2 enhances hMSC migration and recruitment and thus is relevant for regenerative medicine applications. Stem Cells2019;37:407 416

AB The triazole family of compounds has been implicated in modulating various biological processes such as inflammation, tumorigenesis, and infection. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the effects of 1,2,3 triazole substituted biarylacrylonitrile compounds, including KP A021, on the differentiation and function of osteoclasts. KP A021 and its triazole derivatives, at a concentration that does not cause a cytotoxic response in bone marrow macrophages (BMMs), significantly inhibited osteoclast differentiation induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor B ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony stimulating factor (M CSF) as assessed by tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. KP A021 also dramatically inhibited the expression of marker genes associated with osteoclast differentiation, such as TRAP, cathepsin K (Cat K), dendritic cell specific transmembrane protein (DC STAMP), and nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). Furthermore, KP A021 inhibited actin ring formation in osteoclasts as well as resorption pit formation induced by osteoclasts. Analysis of the signaling pathway for KP A021 indicated that this triazole compound inhibited the RANKL induced activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) and its upstream signaling molecule, mitogen activated protein kinase kinase1/2 (MEK1/2). Taken together, these results demonstrate that KP A021 has an inhibitory effect on the differentiation and function of osteoclasts via modulation of the RANKL induced activation of the MEK ERK pathway.

AB Adhesive interactions between multiple myeloma ( MM) cells and marrow stromal cells activate multiple signaling pathways including nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B), p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) in stromal cells, which promote tumor growth and bone destruction. Sequesto some 1 (p62), an adapter protein that has no intrinsic enzymatic activity, serves as a platform to facilitate formation of signaling complexes for these pathways. Therefore, we determined if targeting only p62 would inhibit multiple signaling pathways activated in the MM microenvironment and thereby decrease MM cell growth and osteoclast formation. Signaling through NF kappa B and p38 MAPK was increased in primary stromal cells from MM patients. Increased interleukin 6 (IL 6) production by MM stromal cells was p38 MAPK dependent while increased vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM 1) expression was NF kappa B dependent. Knocking down p62 in patient derived stromal cells significantly decreased protein kinase C zeta(PKC zeta), VCAM 1, and IL 6 levels as well as decreased stromal cell support of MM cell growth. Similarly, marrow stromal cells from p62( / ) mice produced much lower levels of IL 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand (RANKL) and supported MM cell growth and osteoclast formation to a much lower extent than normal cells. Thus, p62 is an attractive therapeutic target for MM. (Blood. 2009;113:4894 4902)

AB Background and Objectives: Stem cell based regeneration strategies have shown therapeutic efficacy in various fields of regenerative medicine. These include bone healing after bone augmentation, often complicated by pain, which is managed by using nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, information is limited about how NSAIDs affect the therapeutic potential of stem cells. Materials and Methods: We investigated the effects of ibuprofen and diclofenac on the characteristics, morphology, and immunophenotype of human mesenchymal stromal cells isolated from the dental pulp (DPSCs) and cultured in vitro, as well as their effects on the expression of angiogenic growth factors (VEGFA and HGF) and selected genes in apoptosis signalling pathways (BAX, BAK, CASP3, CASP9, and BCL2). Results: Ibuprofen and diclofenac significantly reduced the viability of DPSCs, while the expression of mesenchymal stem cell surface markers was unaffected. Both ibuprofen and diclofenac treatment significantly upregulated the expression of HGF, while the expression of VEGFA remained unchanged. Ibuprofen significantly altered the expression of several apoptosis related genes, including the upregulation of CASP9 and BCL2, with decreased CASP3 expression. BAK, CASP3, CASP9, and BCL2 expressions were significantly increased in the diclofenac treated DPSCs, while no difference was demonstrated in BAX expression. Conclusions: Our results suggest that concomitant use of the NSAIDs ibuprofen or diclofenac with stem cell therapy may negatively impact cell viability and alter the expression of apoptosis related genes, affecting the efficacy of stem cell therapy.

AB Embryonic skeletogenesis and postnatal bone development require the transfer of calcium from the mother to the offspring during pregnancy and lactation. Therefore, bone resorption in the mother becomes elevated during these periods, resulting in significant maternal skeletal loss. There follows an anabolic phase around weaning during which there is a remarkable recovery of the maternal skeleton. However, the mechanism(s) of this anabolic response remain(s) largely unknown. We identified eight differentially expressed miRNAs by array profiling, of which miR 874 3p was highly expressed at weaning, a time when bone loss was noted to recover. We report that this weaning associated miRNA is an anabolic target. Therefore, an agomir of miR 874 3p induced osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. These actions were mediated through the inhibition of Hdac1 expression and enhanced Runx2 transcriptional activation. When injected in vivo, the agomir significantly increased osteoblastogenesis and mineralization, reversed bone loss caused by ovariectomy, and increased bone strength. We speculate that elevated miR 874 3p expression during weaning enhances bone formation and that this miRNA may become a therapeutic target for conditions of bone loss.

AB Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone mass and bone microarchitectural failure, leading to an enhanced risk of bone fractures. Chrysanthemum coronarium L. (CC) is a natural plant with powerful antioxidant activity. This study investigated the antiosteoporotic effects of CC extracts in in vitro cell cultures and in vivo bone loss animal models. CC stimulated osteoblast differentiation and mineralized bone formation by osteoblasts by increasing the expression of bone formation markers (alkaline phosphatase, osteoprotegerin, and osteoprotegerin/receptor activator nuclear factor kappa B ligand ratio) in the murine preosteoblastic cell line MC3T3 E1. Additionally, CC was found to inhibit osteoclast differentiation by downregulating bone resorption markers (tartrate resistant acid phosphatase, cathepsin K, dendritic cell specific transmembrane protein, and calcitonin receptor) in the murine macrophage like cell line RAW264.7. CC prevented ovariectomy induced bone loss, preserved trabecular microarchitecture, and improved serum bone turnover markers in an osteoporotic mouse model. These findings suggest that CC extract may be considered as a natural therapeutic or preventive agent for osteoporotic bone loss.

TI Itm2a expression marks periosteal skeletal stem cells that contribute to
   bone fracture healing
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION

ID IDENTIFICATION; MARROW; RECOMBINASE; OSTEOBLASTS
AB The periosteum contains skeletal stem/progenitor cells that contribute to bone fracture healing. However, the in vivo identity of periosteal skeletal stem cells (P SSCs) remains unclear, and membrane protein markers of P SSCs that facilitate tissue engineering are needed. Here, we identified integral membrane protein 2A ( Itm2a ) enriched in SSCs using single cell transcriptomics. Itm2a+ + P SSCs displayed clonal multipotency and self renewal and sat at the apex of their differentiation hierarchy. Lineage tracing experiments showed that Itm2a selectively labeled the periosteum and that Itm2a+ + cells were preferentially located in the outer fibrous layer of the periosteum. The Itm2a+ + cells rarely expressed CD34 or Osx, , but expressed periosteal markers such as Ctsk, , CD51, , PDGFRA, , Sca1, , and Gli1. . Itm2a+ + P SSCs contributed to osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and marrow stromal cells upon injury. Genetic lineage tracing using dual recombinases showed that Itm2a and Prrx1 lineage cells generated spatially separated subsets of chondrocytes and osteoblasts during fracture healing. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 ( Bmp2 ) deficiency or ablation of Itm2a+ + P SSCs resulted in defects in fracture healing. ITM2A+ + P SSCs were also present in the human periosteum. Thus, our study identified a membrane protein marker that labels P SSCs, providing an attractive target for drug and cellular therapy for skeletal disorders.

AB Bone lesions are a major cause of morbidity in Gaucher disease (GD) type I. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been successful in treating many symptoms of type I GD but skeletal response lags behind. Local exogenous glueocerebrosidase supplementation in bone lesions via a drug delivery system may overcome this limitation. Although local enzyme supplementation aims to target lipid engorged macrophages (Gaucher Cells) in bone compartment, enzyme uptake by osteoblasts is not excluded. To investigate the ability of human osteoblasts to internalize recombinant glucocerebrosidase (rGCR), we have used an artificial GD human osteoblasts cell culture system. MG63 human osteoblasts were treated with conduritol B epoxide (CBE) to induce complete and prolonged inhibition of endogenous glucocerebrosidase activity of cells. rGCR uptake by glucocerebrosidase inactivated osteoblasts was examined using I 125 radiolabelling, Western blot analysis and measurement of glucocerebrosidase activity. Analysis of radiolabeled enzyme uptake by CBE treated osteoblasts showed 67.9% of internalized protein in cell extract. Enzyme internalization was also observed by Western blot analysis where the amount of mature form of glucocerebrosidase protein recognized by the glucocerebrosidase antibody was increased following the administrations of rGCR. Moreover, enzymatic activity measurement showed 23.9% of glucocerebrosidase activity of control cells. The rGCR internalization by MG63 osteoblast seems to be partially mediated by mannose receptors. These data provide evidence that MG63 human ostcoblasts are able to internalize rGCR. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Bone remodeling imbalance induced by increased osteoclast formation and bone resorption is known to cause skeletal diseases such as osteoporosis. The reduction of estrogen levels at menopause is one of the strongest risk factors developing postmenopausal osteoporosis. This study investigated osteoprotective effects of the dihydrochalcone phloretin found in apple tree leaves on bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) C57BL/6 female mice as a model for postmenopausal osteoporosis. OVX demoted bone mineral density (BMD) of mouse femurs, reduced serum 17 beta estradiol level and enhanced serum receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin ratio with uterine atrophy. Oral administration of 10 mg/kg phloretin to OVX mice for 8 weeks improved such effects, compared to sham operated mice. Phloretin attenuated TRAP activity and cellular expression of beta 3 integrin and carbonic anhydrase II augmented in femoral bone tissues of OVX mice. This study further examined that osteogenic activity of phloretin in RANKL differentiated Raw 264.7 macrophages into mature osteoclasts. Phloretin at 1 20 mu M stimulated Smac expression and capase 3 activation concurrently with nuclear fragmentation of multi nucleated osteoclasts, indicating that this compound promoted osteoclast apoptosis. Consistently, phloretin enhanced bcl 2 induction but diminished bax expression. Furthermore, phloretin activated ASK 1 diverged JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways in mature osteoclasts, whereas it dose dependently inhibited the RANKL stimulated activation of ERK. Therefore, phloretin manipulated ASK 1 MAPK signal transduction leading to transcription of apoptotic genes. Phloretin was effective in preventing estrogen deficiency induced osteoclastogenic resorption. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI Irisin Enhances Osteoblast Differentiation In Vitro

DT Article
ID BROWN ADIPOSE TISSUE; PHYSICAL ACTIVITY; EXERCISE; FAT; MECHANISMS;
   MURINE; FNDC5
AB It has been recently demonstrated that exercise activity increases the expression of the myokine Irisin in skeletal muscle, which is able to drive the transition of white to brown adipocytes, likely following a phenomenon of transdifferentiation. This new evidence supports the idea that muscle can be considered an endocrine organ, given its ability to target adipose tissue by promoting energy expenditure. In accordance with these new findings, we hypothesized that Irisin is directly involved in bone metabolism, demonstrating its ability to increase the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells into mature osteoblasts. Firstly, we confirmed that myoblasts from mice subjected to 3 weeks of free wheel running increased Irisin expression compared to nonexercised state. The conditioned media (CM) collected from myoblasts of exercised mice induced osteoblast differentiation in vitro to a greater extent than those of mice housed in resting conditions. Furthermore, the differentiated osteoblasts increased alkaline phosphatase and collagen I expression by an Irisin dependent mechanism. Our results show, for the first time, that Irisin directly targets osteoblasts, enhancing their differentiation. This finding advances notable perspectives in future studies which could satisfy the ongoing research of exercise mimetic therapies with anabolic action on the skeleton.

AB Proteasome inhibitors exert an anabolic effect on bone formation with elevated levels of osteoblast markers. These findings suggest the important role of the proteasomal degradation of osteogenic regulators, while the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we report that the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and ixazomib markedly increased protein levels of the osteoblastic key transcription factor osterix/Sp7 (Osx). Furthermore, we revealed that Osx was targeted by p38 and Fbw7 for proteasomal degradation. Mechanistically, p38 mediated Osx phosphorylation at S73/77 facilitated Fbw7 interaction to trigger subsequent Osx ubiquitination. Consistent with these findings,p38knockdown or pharmacological p38 inhibition resulted in Osx protein stabilization. Treatment with p38 inhibitors following osteogenic stimulation efficiently induced osteoblast differentiation through Osx stabilization. Conversely, pretreatment of p38 inhibitor followed by osteogenic challenge impaired osteoblastogenesis via suppressing Osx expression, suggesting that p38 exerts dual but opposite effects in the regulation of Osx level to fine tune its activity during osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore,Fbw7 depleted human mesenchymal stem cells and primary mouse calvarial cells resulted in increased osteogenic capacity. Together, our findings unveil the molecular mechanisms underlying the Osx protein stability control and suggest that targeting the Osx degradation pathway could help enhance efficient osteogenesis and bone matrix regeneration.

AB Excessive bone resorption is the cause of several metabolic bone diseases including osteoporosis. Thus, identifying factors that can inhibit osteoclast formation and/or activity may define new drug targets that can be used to develop novel therapies for these conditions. Emerging evidence demonstrates that the master regulator of hematopoiesis, Runx1, is expressed in preosteoclasts and may influence skeletal health. To examine the potential role of Runx1 in osteoclast formation and function, we deleted its expression in myeloid osteoclast precursors by crossing Runx1 floxed mice (Runx1(F/F)) with CD11b Cre transgenic mice. Mice lacking Runx1 in preosteoclasts (CD11b Cre; Runx1F/F) exhibited significant loss of femoral trabecular and cortical bone mass compared with that in Cre negative mice. In addition, serum levels of collagen type 1 cross linked C telopeptide, a biomarker of osteoclast mediated bone resorption, were significantly elevated in CD11b Cre; Runx1(F/F) mice compared with those in Runx1(F/F) mice. Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase positive osteoclasts that differentiated from bone marrow cells of CD11b Cre; Runx1(F/F) mice in vitro were larger, were found in greater numbers, and had increased bone resorbing activity than similarly cultured cells from Runx1(F/F) mice. CD11b Cre; Runx1(F/F) bone marrow cells that were differentiated into osteoclasts in vitro also had elevated mRNA levels of osteoclast related genes including vacuolar ATPase D2, cathepsin K, matrix metalloproteinase 9, calcitonin receptor, osteoclast associated receptor, nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1, and cFos. These data indicate that Runx1 expression in preosteoclasts negatively regulates osteoclast formation and activity and contributes to overall bone mass.

AB Exposure to nicotine and other compounds contained in cigarette smoking affects human health. This study examined the effects of exposure to a single or multiple sub toxic nicotine concentrations on human osteoblasts. Cell growth and expression of genes involved in bone differentiation, extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism, and growth factor signaling pathways were investigated in nicotine treated cells compared to untreated cells. Depending on osteoblast concentration and maturation stages, nicotine differently regulated cell growth. Real time PCR showed regulated expressions of genes expressed by nicotine treated osteoblasts compared to untreated cells. Among ECM genes, type I collagen was down regulated and osteonectin was up regulated in nicotine treated osteoblasts; similarly, fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), two members of FGF signaling system, were discordantly modulated; genes involved in osteoblast maturation and differentiation such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), runt related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), and bone sialoprotein (BSP) were over expressed after drug treatment. Our results show a positive association between nicotine exposure and osteoblast phenotype and illustrate for the first time a mechanism whereby acute or chronic exposure to sub toxic nicotine concentrations may affect bone formation through the impairment of growth factor signaling system and ECM metabolism.

TI Distribution of lovastatin to bone and its effect on bone turnover in

AB Statins, the widely used lipid lowering drugs, are inhibitors of 3 hydroxy 3 methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, which catalyses a rate limiting step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Many previous reports show that statins can act both as bone anabolic and as antiresorptive agents but their beneficial effects on bone turnover are still controversial. Considering their high liver specificity and low oral bioavailability, the distribution of statins to the bone microenvironment is questionable. In this study, the distribution of lovastatin and its active metabolites to bone, with respect to plasma and liver compartments, was examined after oral and intravenous administration in female rats. As compared with oral administration, the distribution of lovastatin to the bone compartment was significantly enhanced after intravenous administration. Further, the effect of lovastatin on bone turnover was studied in vitro and in vivo to assess its anti osteoporotic potential. Lovastatin acid but not lovastatin was found to inhibit parathyroid hormone induced bone resorption in an in vitro chick embryo bone assay. Oral, as well as intravenous, short term lovastatin treatment significantly reduced the serum total cholesterol, serum total alkaline phosphatase and urinary crosslinks in ovariectomized rats. In accordance with its increased distribution to the bone compartment, intravenously administered lovastatin was more effective in reducing the ovariectomy induced increase in markers of bone metabolism, especially urinary crosslinks. The findings of this study suggest that statins inhibit bone resorption and that their anti resorptive efficacy can be increased by administering them by routes other than oral so as to achieve their enhanced concentration in bone.

AB A negative side effect of therapeutic irradiation is the radiation induced bone loss which can lead, in long term, to pathological fractures. Until today, the detailed mechanism is unknown. If osteoclasts would mainly contribute to the pathological bone loss, bisphosphonates could potentially counteract the osteolytic process and possibly help to prevent long term complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of zoledronic acid on the early radiation induced degradation of bone collagen fibrils by monitoring the urinary excretion of hydroxylysylpyridinoline and lysylpyridinoline under radiotherapy.
   A total of 40 patients with skeletal metastases were assigned for a local radiotherapy and bisphosphonate treatment. The patients were prospectively randomized into two treatment groups: group A (n = 20) received the first zoledronate administration after and group B (n = 20) prior to the radiotherapy. Urine samples were collected from each patient on the first day, in the middle, and on the last day of the radiation therapy. Measurement of the bone metabolites hydroxylysylpyridinoline and lysylpyridinoline was performed by high performance liquid chromatography. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann Whitney U test.
   The hydroxylysylpyridinoline and lysylpyridinoline excretion decreased significantly in the combined bisphosphonate and radiotherapy group (p = 0.02, p = 0.08). No significant change of the hydroxylysylpyridinoline and lysylpyridinoline excretion was determined in the patients that received solely irradiation.
   The results indicate the ability of zoledronate to prevent the early radiation induced bone collagen degradation suggesting that the radiation induced bone loss is mainly caused by osteoclastic bone resorption rather than by a direct radiation induced damage.

AB Aging is accompanied by imbalanced bone remodeling, elevated osteocyte apoptosis, and decreased bone mass and mechanical properties; and improved pharmacologic approaches to counteract bone deterioration with aging are needed. We examined herein the effect of mefloquine, a drug used to treat malaria and systemic lupus erythematosus and shown to ameliorate bone loss in glucocorticoid treated patients, on bone mass and mechanical properties in young and old mice. Young 3.5 month old and old 21 month old female C57BL/6 mice received daily injections of 5 mg/kg/day mefloquine for 14 days. Aging resulted in the expected changes in bone volume and mechanical properties. In old mice mefloquine administration reversed the lower vertebral cancellous bone volume and bone formation; and had modest effects on cortical bone volume, thickness, and moment of inertia. Mefloquine administration did not change the levels of the circulating bone formation markers P1NP or alkaline phosphatase, whereas levels of the resorption marker CTX showed trends towards increase with mefloquine treatment. In addition, and as expected, aging bones exhibited an accumulation of active caspase3 expressing osteocytes and higher expression of apoptosis related genes compared to young mice, which were not altered by mefloquine administration at either age. In young animals, mefloquine induced higher periosteal bone formation, but lower endocortical bone formation. Further, osteoclast numbers were higher on the endocortical bone surface and circulating CTX levels were increased, in mefloquine compared to vehicletreated young mice. Consistent with this, addition of mefloquine to bone marrow cells isolated from young mice led to increased osteoclastic gene expression and a tendency towards increased osteoclast numbers in vitro. Taken together our findings identify the age and bone site specific skeletal effects of mefloquine. Further, our results highlight a beneficial effect of mefloquine administration on vertebral cancellous bone mass in old animals, raising the possibility of using this pharmacologic inhibitor to preserve skeletal health with aging.

AB The use of BMP 2 in orthopedic surgery is limited by uncertainty surrounding its effects on the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and how this is affected by cellular aging. This study compared the effects of recombinant human BMP 2 (rhBMP 2) on osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation between senescent and non senescent MSCs. Senescent and non  senescent MSCs were cultured in osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation medium containing various concentrations of rhBMP 2. The phenotypes of these cells were compared by performing a calcium assay, adipogenesis assay, staining, real time PCR, western blotting, and microarray analysis. rhBMP  2 induced osteogenic differentiation to a lesser extent (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005 for alkaline phosphatase activity and  Ca2+ release) in senescent MSCs regardless of dose dependent increase in both cells. However, the induction of adipogenic differentiation by rhBMP 2 was comparable between them. There was no difference between these two groups of cells in the adipogenesis assay (P = 0.279) and their expression levels of PPAR. were similar. Several genes such as CHRDL1, NOG, SMAD1, SMAD7, and FST encoding transcription factors were proposed to underlie the different responses of senescent and non senescent MSCs to rhBMP 2 in microarray analyses. Furthermore, inflammatory, adipogenic, or cell death related signaling pathways such as NF kB or p38 MAPK pathways were upregulated by BMP 2 in senescent MSCs, whereas bone forming signaling pathways involving BMP, SMAD, and TGF beta were upregulated in non senescent MSCs as expected. This phenomenon explains bone forming dominance by non senescent MSCs and possible frequent complications such as seroma, osteolysis, or neuritis in senescent MSCs during BMP 2 use in orthopedic surgery.

AB Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is central to calcium homeostasis and bone maintenance in vertebrates, and as such it has been used for treating osteoporosis. It acts primarily by binding to its receptor, PTH1R, a member of the class B G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family that also includes receptors for glucagon, calcitonin, and other therapeutically important peptide hormones. Despite considerable interest and much research, determining the structure of the receptor hormone complex has been hindered by difficulties in purifying the receptor and obtaining diffraction quality crystals. Here, we present a method for expression and purification of the extracellular domain (ECD) of human PTH1R engineered as a maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion that readily crystallizes. The 1.95 angstrom structure of PTH bound to the MBP PTH1R ECD fusion reveals that PTH docks as an amphipathic helix into a central hydrophobic groove formed by a three layer alpha beta beta alpha fold of the PTH1R ECD, resembling a hot dog in a bun. Conservation in the ECD scaffold and the helical structure of peptide hormones emphasizes this hot dog model as a general mechanism of hormone recognition common to class B GPCRs. Our findings reveal critical insights into PTH actions and provide a rational template for drug design that targets this hormone signaling pathway.

AB Trisomy 21 (Ts21) causes alterations in skeletal development resulting in decreased bone mass, shortened stature and weaker bones in individuals with Down syndrome (DS). There is a sexual dimorphism in bone mineral density (BMD) deficits associated with DS with males displaying earlier deficits than females. The relationships between causative trisomic genes, cellular mechanisms, and influence of sex in DS skeletal abnormalities remain unknown. One hypothesis is that the low bone turnover phenotype observed in DS results from attenuated osteoblast function, contributing to impaired trabecular architecture, altered cortical geometry, and decreased mineralization. DYRK1A, found in three copies in humans with DS, Ts65Dn, and Dp1Tyb DS model mice, has been implicated in the development of postnatal skeletal phenotypes associated with DS. Reduced copy number of Dyrk1a to euploid levels from conception in an otherwise trisomic Ts65Dn mice resulted in a rescue of appendicular bone deficits, suggesting DYRK1A contributes to skeletal development and homeostasis. We hypothesized that reduction of Dyrk1a copy number in trisomic osteoblasts would improve cellular function and resultant skeletal structural anomalies in trisomic mice. Female mice with a floxed Dyrk1a gene (Ts65Dn,Dyrk1a(fl/wt)) were mated with male Osx Cre(+) (expressed in osteoblasts beginning around E13.5) mice, resulting in reduced Dyrk1a copy number in mature osteoblasts in Ts65Dn,Dyrk1a(+/+/Osx Cre) P42 male and female trisomic and euploid mice, compared with littermate controls. Male and female Ts65Dn,Dyrk1a(+/+/+) (3 copies of DYRK1A in osteoblasts) and Ts65Dn,Dyrk1a(+/+/Osx Cre) (2 copies of Dyrk1a in osteoblasts) displayed similar defects in both trabecular architecture and cortical geometry, with no improvements with reduced Dyrk1a in osteoblasts. This suggests that trisomic DYRK1A does not affect osteoblast function in a cell autonomous manner at or before P42. Although male Dp1Tyb and Ts65Dn mice exhibit similar skeletal deficits at P42 in both trabecular and cortical bone compartments between euploid and trisomic mice, female Ts65Dn mice exhibit significant cortical and trabecular deficits at P42, in contrast to an absence of genotype effect in female Dp1Tyb mice in trabecular bone. Taken together, these data suggest skeletal deficits in DS mouse models and are sex and age dependent, and influenced by strain effects, but are not solely caused by the overexpression of Dyrk1a in osteoblasts. Identifying molecular and cellular mechanisms, disrupted by gene dosage imbalance, that are involved in the development of skeletal phenotypes associated with DS could help to design therapies to rescue skeletal deficiencies seen in DS.

AB The discovery of the bone gut axis linking bone metabolism to gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis has revolutionized our understanding of managing degenerative skeletal diseases. Targeting GM regulation has emerged as a promising approach to osteoporosis treatment. Herein, we develop propolis nanoemulsions (PNEs) with enhanced gastrointestinal stability and oral bioavailability for GM based osteoporosis therapy. Orally administered PNEs exhibit superior antiosteoporosis efficacy in an ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model by modulating the GM structure and metabolites and restoring the intestinal barrier function. Multiomics analysis reveals that a reduction in Streptococcus abundance and an increase in the GM metabolite l arginine are key factors in osteoporosis management. These changes suppress osteoclast activity and enhance osteoblast function, leading to balanced bone remodeling and, thus, significant antiosteoporotic effects via the gut bone axis. Our results deepen insights into the intricate relationship between GM and bone remodeling, suggesting a promising strategy that maintains the homeostasis of the GM structure and metabolite for osteoporosis treatment.

AB Bone is the most common target of metastasis in breast cancer and prostate cancer, leading to significant mortality due to lack of effective treatments. The discovery of novel therapies has been hampered by a lack of physiologically relevant in vitro models that can mimic key clinical features of bone metastases. To fill this critical gap, here we report spatially patterned, tissue engineered 3D models of breast cancer and prostate cancer bone metastasis which mimic bone specific invasion, cancer aggressiveness, cancer induced dysregulation of bone remodeling, and in vivo drug response. We demonstrate the potential of integrating such 3D models with single cell RNA sequencing to identify key signaling drivers of cancer metastasis to bone. Together, these results validate that spatially patterned 3D bone metastasis models mimic key clinical features of bone metastasis and can serve as a novel research tool to elucidate bone metastasis biology and expedite drug discovery.

AB There is a greater incidence of anterior cruciate ligament tears due to noncontact sports injuries in women compared with men. Anterior cruciate ligament tears are associated with accelerated development of knee osteoarthritis (OA), which is also more prevalent in women than in men. This article considers therapeutic modalities that are best suited for athletic women with knee OA. Clinical data on the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapies for knee OA, including acetaminophen, oral nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and topical NSAIDs, are discussed, with attention paid to special considerations for women who participate in athletic activity. Adverse events associated with the use of acetaminophen and oral NSAIDs place potential limits on the dose and duration of therapy and may be of greater concern in female athletes than in other patient groups. Topical NSAIDs, which effect relief through the same mechanism of action as oral NSAIDs, produce dramatically lower systemic NSAID exposure compared with oral NSAIDs and are associated with a lower incidence of systemic adverse events. These findings, along with additional future studies, may have particular relevance to the choice of the most effective treatment options for athletic women with OA of the knee.

AB Atypical femoral fractures (AFFs) are a rare but potentially devastating event, often but not always linked to bisphosphonate (BP) therapy. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying AFFs remain obscure, and there are no tests available that might assist in identifying those at high risk of AFF. We previously used exome sequencing to explore the genetic background of three sisters with AFFs and three additional unrelated AFF cases, all previously treated with BPs. We detected 37 rare mutations (in 34 genes) shared by the three sisters. Notably, we found a p.Asp188Tyr mutation in the enzyme geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase, a component of the mevalonate pathway, which is critical to osteoclast function and is inhibited by N BPs. In addition, the CYP1A1 gene, responsible for the hydroxylation of 17 beta estradiol, estrone, and vitamin D, was also mutated in all three sisters and one unrelated patient. Here we present a detailed list of the variants found and report functional analyses of the GGPS1 p.Asp188Tyr mutation, which showed a severe reduction in enzyme activity together with oligomerization defects. Unlike BP treatment, this genetic mutation will affect all cells in the carriers. RNAi knockdown of GGPS1 in osteoblasts produced a strong mineralization reduction and a reduced expression of osteocalcin, osterix, and RANKL, whereas in osteoclasts, it led to a lower resorption activity. Taken together, the impact of the mutated GGPPS and the relevance of the downstream effects in bone cells make it a strong candidate for AFF susceptibility. We speculate that other genes such as CYP1A1 might be involved in AFF pathogenesis, which remains to be functionally proved. The identification of the genetic background for AFFs provides new insights for future development of novel risk assessment tools. (c) 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the ability of differentiating into osteoblasts. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of MSC differentiation into osteoblasts may provide novel therapeutic strategies for bone related diseases. Increasing evidence has confirmed that Wnt signaling plays the key role in osteoblast differentiation; however, the role of individual Wnt proteins in osteogenesis needs to be investigated. The present study thus aimed to explore the role of Wnt7a in bone formation. For this purpose, human bone derived MSCs were identified by flow cytometry and the cell differentiation potential, including osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation was examined. In order to explore the role of Wnt7a in MSC osteogenic differentiation, Wnt7a expression was measured at the mRNA and protein level following treatment with the osteogenic inducer, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)4/7, and following the induction of osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation. The ectopic expression of Wnt7a in MSCs was confirmed and its influence on MSC osteogenic differentiation was detected using osteocyte markers and by Alizarin Red S staining. Mechanistically, the influence of Wnt7a on Runt related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression was examined at the mRNA and protein level. The regulatory effects of Wnt7a on RUNX2 promoter activities were examined by promoter reporter assay, and by examining the binding of TCF1, a downstream target of Wnt, to the RUNX2 promoter by ChIP assay. The results revealed that the knockdown of Wnt7a in MSCs decreased the expression of osteocyte markers and inhibited osteogenic differentiation. In accordance, the overexpression of Wnt7a in MSCs increased the expression of osteocyte markers and promoted osteogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, the knockdown of Wnt7a in MSCs reduced RUNX2 expression and the overexpression of Wnt7a in MSCs promoted RUNX2 expression. Furthermore, it was confirmed that Wnt7a regulated RUNX2 promoter activities by promoter report assay, and by examining the binding of TCF1 to the RUNX2 promoter by ChIP assay. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that Wnt7a plays a key role in MSC differentiation into osteoblasts and the findings presented herein may provide a promising therapy target for bone related diseases.

AB We used an osteopenic adult ovariectomized (OVX) rat model to evaluate various sequential treatments for osteoporosis, using FDA approved agents with complementary tissue level mechanisms of action. Sequential treatment for 3 months each with alendronate (Aln), followed by PTH, followed by resumption of Aln, created the highest trabecular bone mass, best microarchitecture, and highest bone strength.
   Individual agents used to treat human osteoporosis reduce fracture risk by similar to 50 60 %. As agents that act with complementary mechanisms are available, sequential therapies that mix antiresorptive and anabolic agents could improve fracture risk reduction, when compared with monotherapies.
   We evaluated bone mass, bone microarchitecture, and bone strength in adult OVX, osteopenic rats, during different sequences of vehicle (Veh), parathyroid hormone (PTH), Aln, or raloxifene (Ral) in three 90  day treatment periods, over 9 months. Differences among groups were evaluated. The interrelationships of bone mass and microarchitecture endpoints and their relationship to bone strength were studied.
   Estrogen deficiency caused bone loss. OVX rats treated with Aln monotherapy had significantly better bone mass, microarchitecture, and bone strength than untreated OVX rats. Rats treated with an Aln drug holiday had bone mass and microarchitecture similar to the Aln monotherapy group but with significantly lower bone strength. PTH treated rats had markedly higher bone endpoints, but all were lost after PTH withdrawal without follow up treatment. Rats treated with PTH followed by Aln had better bone endpoints than those treated with Aln monotherapy, PTH monotherapy, or an Aln holiday. Rats treated initially with Aln or Ral, then switched to PTH, also had better bone endpoints, than monotherapy treatment. Rats treated with Aln, then PTH, and returned to Aln had the highest values for all endpoints.
   Our data indicate that antiresorptive therapy can be coupled with an anabolic agent, to produce and maintain better bone mass, microarchitecture, and strength than can be achieved with any monotherapy.

AB Osteoclasts play a critical role in bone resorbing disorders such as osteoporosis, periodontitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, discovery of agents capable of suppressing osteoclast differentiation may aid the development of a therapeutic access for the treatment of pathological bone loss. Ampelopsis brevipedunculata has been used as herbal folk medicine to treat liver diseases and inflammation in Asia. However, its effects on osteoclast differentiation are unknown. We were aimed to investigate the anti osteoclastogenic activity in vitro and in vivo and to elucidate the underlying mechanism of Ampelopsis brevipedunculata extract (ABE). In this study, ABE inhibited receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand (RANKL) induced osteoclast differentiation, the formation of filamentous actin rings and the bone resorbing activity of mature osteoclasts. ABE inhibited RANKL induced p38 and I kappa B phosphorylation and I kappa B degradation. Also, ABE suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) and c Fos, and the mRNA expression of genes required for cell fusion and bone resorption, such as osteoclast associated receptor (OSCAR), tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin K, dendritic cell specific transmembrane protein (DC STAMP), beta 3 integrin and osteoclast stimulatory transmembrane protein (OC STAMP). Furthermore, results of micro CT and histologic analysis indicated that ABE remarkably prevented lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced bone erosion. These results demonstrate that ABE prevents LPS induced bone erosion through inhibition of osteoclast differentiation and function, suggesting the promise of ABE as a potential cure for various osteoclast associated bone diseases.

AB Icariin, the main constituent of Herba Epimedii, appears to be a promising alternative to classic drugs used to treat osteoporosis. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of its action and the role of icariin in the cross talk between osteoblasts and adipocytes remain unclear. The present study was designed to investigate the gene expression profile of primary osteoblasts in the presence of icariin, and the effects of icariin on the differentiation and adipogenic transdifferentiation of osteoblasts. Cellular and molecular markers expressed during osteoblastic differentiation were assessed by cytochemical analysis, real time quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and cDNA microarray analysis. Results indicated that icariin up regulated the expression of runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2), and collagen type 1 (Col1) genes, and down regulated the expression of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (Pparg) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (Cebpb) genes. These effects were blocked by ICI 182,780, suggesting that icariin may be acting via the estrogen receptor (ER). Results also demonstrated that the ratio of osteoprotegerin (Opg)/receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (Rankl) expression was up regulated following treatment with icariin. In total, osteoblastic gene expression profile analysis suggested that 33 genes were affected by icariin; these could be sub divided into nine functional categories. It appears that icariin could stimulate the differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts, regulate the differentiation of osteoclasts, and inhibit the adipogenic transdifferentiation of osteoblasts, therefore increasing the number of osteoblasts undergoing differentiation to mature osteoblasts, via an ER mediated pathway. In summary, icariin may exhibit beneficial effects on bone health, especially for patients with osteoporosis and obesity.

AB Photobiomodulation (PBM) has been used for bone regenerative purposes in different fields of medicine and dentistry, but contradictory results demand a skeptical look for its potential benefits. This in vitro study compared PBM potentiality by red (635 +/  5 nm) or near infrared (NIR, 808 +/  10 nm) diode lasers and violet blue (405 +/  5 nm) light emitting diode operating in a continuous wave with a 0.4 J/cm(2) energy density, on human osteoblast and mesenchymal stromal cell (hMSC) viability, proliferation, adhesion and osteogenic differentiation. PBM treatments did not alter viability (PI/Syto16 and MTS assays). Confocal immunofluorescence and RT PCR analyses indicated that red PBM (i) on both cell types increased vinculin rich clusters, osteogenic markers expression (Runx 2, alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin) and mineralized bone like nodule structure deposition and (ii) on hMSCs induced stress fiber formation and upregulated the expression of proliferation marker Ki67. Interestingly, osteoblast responses to red light were mediated by Akt signaling activation, which seems to positively modulate reactive oxygen species levels. Violet blue light irradiated cells behaved essentially as untreated ones and NIR irradiated ones displayed modifications of cytoskeleton assembly, Runx 2 expression and mineralization pattern. Although within the limitations of an in vitro experimentation, this study may suggest PBM with 635 nm laser as potential effective option for promoting/improving bone regeneration.

AB Introduction: Liraglutide (Lrg), a novel anti diabetic drug that mimics the endogenous glucagon like peptide 1 to potentiate insulin secretion, is observed to be capable of partially reversing osteopenia. The aim of the present study is to further investigate the efficacy and potential anti osteoporosis mechanisms of Lrg for improving bone pathology, bone  related parameters under imageology, and serum bone metabolism indexes in an animal model of osteoporosis with or without diabetes. Methods: Eight databases were searched from their inception dates to April 27, 2024. The risk of bias and data on outcome measures were analyzed by the CAMARADES 10 item checklist and Rev Man 5.3 software separately. Results: Seventeen eligible studies were ultimately included in this review. The number of criteria met in each study varied from 4/10 to 8/10 with an average of 5.47. The aspects of blinded induction of the model, blinding assessment of outcome and sample size calculation need to be strengthened with emphasis. The pre clinical evidence reveals that Lrg is capable of partially improving bone related parameters under imageology, bone pathology, and bone maximum load, increasing serum osteocalcin, N terminal propeptide of type I procollagen, and reducing serum c terminal cross linked telopeptide of type I collagen (P<0.05). Lrg reverses osteopenia likely by activating osteoblast proliferation through promoting the Wnt signal pathway, p AMPK/PGC1 alpha signal pathway, and inhibiting the activation of osteoclasts by inhibiting the OPG/RANKL/RANK signal pathway through anti inflammatory, antioxidant and anti autophagic pathways. Furthermore, the present study recommends that more reasonable usage methods of streptozotocin, including dosage and injection methods, as well as other types of osteoporosis models, be attempted in future studies. Discussion: Based on the results, this finding may help to improve the priority of Lrg in the treatment of diabetes patients with osteoporosis.

AB Desoxyrhapontigenin (DRG), a stilbene compound from Rheum undulatum, has been found to exhibit various pharmacological activities, however, its impact on osteoclast formation has not been investigated. The present study investigated the effect of DRG on receptor activator of nuclear factor B ligand (RANKL) induced osteoclast differentiation in mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) and inflammation induced bone loss in vivo. BMMs or RAW264.7 cells were treated with DRG, followed by an evaluation of cell viability, RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation, actin ring formation and resorption pits activity. The effects of DRG on the RANKL induced phosphorylation of MAPK and the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) and c Fos were evaluated using western blot analysis once the BMMs were exposed to RANKL and DRG. The expression levels of osteoclast marker genes were also evaluated using western blot analysis and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction A lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced murine bone loss model was used to evaluate the protective effect of DRG on inflammation induced bone loss. The results demonstrated that DRG suppressed the RANKL induced differentiation of BMMs into osteoclasts, osteoclast actin ring formation and bone resorption activity in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, DRG significantly inhibited LPS induced bone loss in a mouse model. At the molecular level, DRG inhibited the RANKL induced activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase, the expression of c Fos, and the induction of NFATc1, a crucial transcription factor for osteoclast formation. DRG decreased the expression levels of osteoclast marker genes, including matrix metalloproteinase 9, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase and cathepsin K. In conclusion, these findings suggested that DRG inhibited the differentiation of BMMs into mature osteoclasts by suppressing the RANKL induced activator protein 1 and NFATc1 signaling pathways, and may be a potential candidate for treating and/or preventing osteoclast associated diseases, including osteoporosis.

AB Inflammatory bone destruction is a prominent feature and a cause of substantial morbidity in several inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), periodontitis, and peri prosthetic loosening. Osteoclasts are unique, multinucleated giant cells that effectively resorb bone and thus are directly responsible for bone destruction in several inflammatory diseases. PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway has been well known to play important roles in regulating adaptive and innate immune cell function. In addition to play roles in immune responses, several lines of evidence demonstrate that PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is critical for osteoclast differentiation and survival. These results suggest that inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway could protect against bone destruction in inflammatory diseases, including RA. However, the clinical use of mTOR inhibitors may be hampered due to limited clinical efficacy and frequent toxic side effects. In the treatment of RA, combination therapy with various disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) has been suggested to improve the therapeutic efficacy and limit the side effects. In this report, we show several experimental evidences that vitamin D 3 modulates mTOR pathway, and present a hypothesis that the combination of mTOR inhibitor and vitamin D 3 can effectively inhibit osteoclast differentiation and function in chronic inflammatory condition such as RA, therefore this combination will be a powerful therapeutic regimen in preventing the inflammation induced bone destruction in RA.

AB The probiotic Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum35624 (R) (B. longum35624 (R)), with its surface exopolysaccharide (EPS624), has previously been demonstrated to induce immunoregulatory responses in the host and may, therefore, be a novel approach to prevent bone loss in inflammatory conditions such as post menopausal osteoporosis (PMO). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of EPS624 on osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation and to assess the potential of B. longum35624 (R) to prevent bone loss in vivo. In vitro cell assays were used to assess the impact of EPS624 on osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation. The potential of two probiotic B. longum35624 (R) strains, including an EPS deficient strain, for preventing ovariectomy (Ovx) induced bone loss was assessed in a murine model. EPS624 prevented osteoclast formation from murine bone marrow precursors under both normal and TNF alpha induced inflammatory conditions and modestly increased mineralized matrix deposition in osteogenic cell cultures. However, in the presence of an anti TLR2 blocking antibody, or in MyD88( / ) osteoclast precursors, the inhibitory effect of EPS624 on osteoclast formation was diminished or completely prevented, respectively. Moreover, EPS624 induced IL 10 production in osteoclast precursors in a TLR2 dependent manner, although IL 10 was dispensable in the EPS624 mediated inhibition of osteoclast formation. In addition, EPS624 producing B. longum35624 (R) partially prevented bone loss in Ovx mice when administered by oral gavage. This study introduced EPS624 as a potential anti resorptive therapy, although optimal in vivo delivery of the probiotic strain for treating low grade inflammatory diseases such as PMO remains to be determined.

AB Calcium phosphate biomaterials such as calcium deficient apatite (CDA) have been contemplated as carrier for delivery of bisphosphonate in bone tissues. In the present work, we have investigated the in vitro biological properties of Zoledronate loaded CDA. CDA was loaded with zoledronate according to a previously described coating process. (31)p MAS NMR spectra demonstrated the effective loading of zoledronate onto CDA. Using C 14 labeled zoledronate, we then demonstrated the in vitro release of zoledronate from CDA. In a first set of experiments, we confirmed that Zoledronate reduced the number of TRAP , vitronectin receptor , and F actin ring positive cells as well as the resorption activity of osteoclasts obtained from a total rabbit bone cell culture. Interestingly, Zoledronate loaded CDA and its extractive solutions decreased the osteoclastic resorption. Finally, zoledronate loaded CDA did not affect the viability and alkaline phosphatase activity of primary osteoblastic cells. These data demonstrate that CDA is effective for loading and release of zoledronate. The released zoledronate inhibited osteoclastic resorption without affecting osteoblasts. Our findings therefore suggest that such a drug delivery system would allow an increase in the efficiency of bisphosphonates by being locally available. Further experiments are now required to evaluate the in vivo antiresorptive activity of this concept. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res 89A: 46 56, 2009

AB Aim This Clinical Guidance is aimed to help practitioners assess, diagnose and manage their patients with osteoporosis (OP), using the best available evidence. Methods A literature search using PubMed (MEDLINE) and The Cochrane Library identified all relevant articles on OP and its assessment, diagnosis and treatment, from 2005, to update from the previous edition published in 2006. The studies were assessed and the level of evidence assigned; for each statement, studies with the highest level of evidence were used to frame the recommendation. Results This article summarizes the diagnostic and treatment pathways for OP, highlighting the new data that have changed the way we assess and treat OP. Instead of starting treatment based on bone mineral density alone, there has been a move to assessing 10 year fracture risk before treatment, using tools such as the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX). There has been a re evaluation on calcium supplementation and more emphasis on the importance of vitamin D. There has been concern about the potential adverse effects of the long term usage of bisphosphonates, which we have discussed fully. New drugs that have been licensed since 2006 in Malaysia have been included. Conclusions Adequate intake of calcium (1000mg from both diet and supplements) and vitamin D (800 IU) daily remain important in the treatment of OP. However, in confirmed OP, pharmacological therapy with anti resorptives is the mainstay of treatment. Patients need to be regularly assessed while on medication and treatment adjusted as required.

AB Simple Summary Osteosarcoma is highly variable and heterogeneous, which is one of the reasons for its resistance to treatment. Because osteosarcoma is defined by abnormal bone formation, we hypothesize its suppression could lead to effective treatment for all types of osteosarcomas. Sclerostin is secreted by osteocytes and inhibits the canonical pathway by binding to LRP5/6, thereby suppressing bone formation. The resulting suppression of bone formation leads to bone loss and osteoporosis. Here, we investigated the antitumor effect of sclerostin against osteosarcoma and found that sclerostin suppressed the proliferative capacity and migratory ability of osteosarcoma cells. Various risk factors and causative genes of osteosarcoma have been reported in the literature; however, its etiology remains largely unknown. Bone formation is a shared phenomenon in all types of osteosarcomas, and sclerostin is an extracellular soluble factor secreted by osteocytes that prevents bone formation by inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway. We aimed to investigate the antitumor effect of sclerostin against osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma model mice were prepared by transplantation into the dorsal region of C3H/He and BALB/c nu/nu mice using osteosarcoma cell lines LM8 (murine) and 143B (human), respectively. Cell proliferations were evaluated by using alamarBlue and scratch assays. The migratory ability of the cells was evaluated using a migration assay. Sclerostin was injected intraperitoneally for 7 days to examine the suppression of tumor size and extension of survival. The administration of sclerostin to osteosarcoma cells significantly inhibited the growth and migratory ability of osteosarcoma cells. Kaplan Meier curves and survival data demonstrated that sclerostin significantly inhibited tumor growth and improved survival. Sclerostin suppressed the proliferative capacity and migratory ability of osteosarcoma cells. Osteosarcoma model mice inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival periods by the administration of sclerostin. The effect of existing anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin should be investigated for future clinical applications.

AB Various conditions, including bacterial infection, can promote osteonecrosis. For example, following invasive dental therapy with anti bone resorptive agents, some patients develop osteonecrosis in the jaw; however, pathological mechanisms underlying these outcomes remain unknown. Here, we show that administration of anti resorptive agents such as the bisphosphonate alendronate accelerates osteonecrosis promoted by infectious osteomyelitis. Potent suppression of bone turnover by these types of agents is considered critical for osteonecrosis development; however, using mouse models we found that acceleration of bone turnover by teriparatide injection did not prevent osteonecrosis but rather converted osteoclast progenitors to macrophages expressing inflammatory cytokines, which were required for osteonecrosis development. In fact, we demonstrate that TNF alpha , IL 1 alpha/beta or IL 6 deficient mice as well as wild type mice administered a TNFa inhibitor were significantly resistant to development of osteonecrosis accompanying infectious myelitis, even under bisphosphonate treatment. Our data provide new insight into mechanisms underlying osteonecrosis and suggest new ways to prevent it.

TI Pristimerin Inhibits Osteoclast Differentiation and Bone Resorption in
   vitro and Prevents Ovariectomy Induced Bone Loss in vivo
SO DRUG DESIGN DEVELOPMENT AND THERAPY
LA English
DT Article

AB Introduction: Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease characterized by reduced bone quantity and microstructure, typically owing to increased osteoclastogenesis and/or enhanced osteoclastic bone resorption, resulting in uncontrolled bone loss, which primarily affects postmenopausal women. In consideration of the severe side effects of current drugs for osteoporosis, new safe and effective medications are necessary. Pristimerin (Pri), a quinone methide triterpene extracted from Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae members, exhibits potent antineoplastic and anti inflammatory effects. However, its effect on osteoclasts remains unknown.
   Materials and Methods: We evaluated the anti osteoclastogenic and anti resorptive effect of Pri on bone marrow derived osteoclasts and its underlying mechanism in vitro. In addition, the protective effect of Pri on ovariectomy model was also explored in vivo.
   Results: In vitro, Pri inhibited osteoclast differentiation and mature osteoclastic bone resorption in a time  and dose dependent manner. Further, Pri suppressed the expression of osteoclast related genes and the activation of key proteins. Pri also inhibited the early activation of ERK, JNK MAPK, and AKT signaling pathways in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs), ultimately inhibiting the induction and activation of the crucial osteoclast transcriptional factor nuclear factor of activated T cell cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). In vivo, consistent with our in vitro data, Pri clearly prevented ovariectomy induced bone loss.
   Conclusion: Our data showed that Pri inhibits the differentiation and activation of osteoclasts in vitro and in vivo, and could be a promising candidate for treating osteoporosis.

AB Osteoporosis has been a major health problem for many elderly people and post menopausal women with poor prognosis. Bone turnover markers (BTMs) reflecting bone metabolisms are applied to evaluating clinical results and monitoring of compliance in anti resorptive and anabolic therapy for osteoporosis. The numerical changes and clinical significance of BTMs in two therapies are summarized and the practical application and potential value of PINP and CTX as therapeutic target, threshold of follow up therapy, and evaluation of fracture risk in different regimes such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, raloxifene, teriparatide, abaloparatide, and romosozumab are reviewed in this paper. The application of BTMs is expected to improve the efficacy of the treatments and reduce the rate of osteoporotic fracture in clinical practice.

AB The cell cell/cell matrix interactions between myoblasts and their extracellular microenvironment have been shown to play a crucial role in the regulation of in vitro myogenic differentiation and in vivo skeletal muscle regeneration. In this study, by harnessing the heparin mimicking polymer, poly(sodium 4 styrenesulfonate) (PSS), which has a negatively charged surface, we engineered an in vitro cell culture platform for the purpose of recapitulating in vivo muscle atrophy like phenotypes. Our initial findings showed that heparin mimicking moieties inhibited the fusion of mononucleated myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes, as indicated by the decreased gene and protein expression levels of myogenic factors, myotube fusion related markers, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We further elucidated the underlying molecular mechanism via transcriptome analyses, observing that the insulin/PI3K/mTOR and Wnt signaling pathways were significantly downregulated by heparin mimicking moieties through the inhibition of FAK/Cav3. Taken together, the easy to adapt heparin mimicking polymer based in vitro cell culture platform could be an attractive platform for potential applications in drug screening, providing clear readouts of changes in insulin/PI3K/mTOR and Wnt signaling pathways.

AB Wearing titanium particle induced osteoclastogenesis, accompanied by peri implant osteolysis, is the main cause of long term failure of hip prosthesis. Currently, medications used for the prevention and treatment of peri implant osteolysis show serious side effects. Therefore, development for more effective new drugs with less side effects is extremely urgent. Vaccarin is a natural flavonoid extracted from Vaccaria segetalis, with various biological functions, including antioxidantory, anti inflammatory, and promotion of angiogenesis. However, the putative role of vaccarin in the inhibition of titanium particle induced osteolysis has not been reported. In this study, it was indicated that vaccarin could effectively inhibit RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis, fusion of F actin rings, bone resorption, and expression of osteoclast marker genes in a dose dependent manner in vitro. Moreover, vaccarin could also inhibit RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis via the inhibition of NF B and MAPK (p38, ERK, and JNK) signaling pathways, and inhibit the transcription of downstream transcription factors, such as c Fos and NFATc1. Consistent with in vitro results, this in vivo study showed that vaccarin exhibited an inhibitory effect on titanium particle induced osteolysis by antiosteoclastogenesis. In conclusion, vaccarin could be a promising agent for preventing and treating peri implant osteolysis.

AB BACKGROUND. Zoledronic acid has been shown to be effective in the treatment of osteoporosis, hypercalcemnia, and metastatic bone tumors. The efficacy of zoledronic acid on primary bone tumors has not been investigated.
   METHODS. A primary bone tumor mouse model was established. Intratibia injection of TC71 cells resulted in an osteolytic bone tumor. Four days after injection the mice were treated with zoledronic acid alone, paclitaxel alone, or zoledronic acid plus paclitaxel. Control mice were treated with phosphate buffered saline. Bone tumor growth was assessed using a Faxitron Specimen Radiography System. The gene expression was detected by reverse   transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR), ELISA, and immunohistochemistry. Osteoclast formation was determined by tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining.
   RESULTS. Zoledronic acid induced apoptosis in TC71 human Ewing sarcoma cells and inhibited cell proliferation. Five weeks after injection, 89% of mice in the control group developed osteolytic bone tumors. Paclitaxel had little effect on bone tumor growth, with 78% of mice developing tumors. By contrast, 44% of mice treated with zoledronic acid developed bone tumors. The most effective treatment was zoledronic acid Plus paclitaxel. Tumor incidence in the combination therapy group was only 22%. Osteoclasts were quantified using TRAP staining. There was a decrease in TRAP positive osteoclasts in tumor tissues from zoledronic acid treated animals compared to control animals. RT PCR, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA assay demonstrated that zoledronic acid up regulated osteoprotegerin expression.
   CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that zoledronic acid induces apoptosis and inhibits primary bone tumor growth in Ewing sarcoma through a mechanism involving the up regulation of osteoprotegerin. Zoledronic acid may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients with Ewing sarcoma.

AB Bone marrow fat infiltration is one of the hallmarks of aging and osteoporotic bones. Marrow adipocytes produce substantial amounts of palmitic acid (PA). PA is toxic to bone forming osteoblasts in vitro, affecting their differentiation, function, and survival. Since rapamycin (RAP) induced inhibition of target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activates autophagy and prevents apoptosis, we hypothesized that RAP may preserve osteoblast viability and reduce PA induced lipotoxicity. Normal human osteoblasts were incubated with RAP in the presence of a lipotoxic concentration of PA or vehicle for 24 and 48 hours. Expression of LC3 protein levels and the phosphorylation of the direct mTORC1 target p70S6K1 T389 were quantified by Western blot. Lysosomes and autophagosomes were studied using confocal fluorescence imaging, lysotracker, and live cell imaging. RAP reduced PA induced apoptosis. In addition, PA induced autophagosome formation increased substantially over the time course, an effect that was significantly regulated by the presence of RAP in the media. In addition, LC3I/II ratios were higher in PA induced cells with RAP whereas p70S6K1 T389 were lower in PA and RAP together. In summary, this study highlights the role of the RAP sensitive mTORC1 pathway in normal human osteoblasts under lipotoxic conditions. RAP associated therapies could, potentially, be targeted for specific roles in osteoporosis and aging bone.

AB Background: Denosumab (DEN) and zoledronic acid (ZOL) currently represent the most potent antiresorptive agents for the treatment of osteoporosis. Despite similar effects on bone resorption, these agents have distinct mechanisms of action. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of DEN and ZOL after two year administration on bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular bone score (TBS), bone turnover markers, and persistence. Methods: A total of 585 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who did not use osteoporosis medications were retrospectively reviewed. 290 patients were administered 60 mg DEN subcutaneously every 6 months from 2017 to 2018, and 295 patients were treated with 5 mg ZOL intravenously yearly from 2015 to 2017. BMD, TBS, and C terminal crosslinking telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX) measurements were obtained at baseline and two year after DEN injection or ZOL infusion. Results: After two year follow up, 188 patients in the DEN group and 183 patients in the ZOL group were compared. BMD change from baseline at two years was significantly greater in the DEN group compared with the ZOL group (P < 0.001). The changes of TBS in the DEN group were statistically significant compared with baseline (P < 0.001) and the ZOL group (P < 0.001). The DEN group led to significantly greater reduction of CTX compared with ZOL group (P = 0.041). Conclusion: In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, DEN was associated with greater BMD increase at all measured skeletal sites, greater increase of TBS, and greater inhibition of bone remodeling compared with ZOL.

AB To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms associated with development of tongue, gene expression profiles of the tongue at embryonic day 13.25 (E13.25) and 15.5 was investigated using Affymetrix Mouse GeneChip. Using the twice significance of difference as the standard, the molecular mechanisms of tongue development were studied and several pathways and networks of essential secreted signaling molecules and downstream transcription factors were identified. The significant pathways of differentially expressed genes were involved in Wnt signaling pathway, Hedgehog signaling pathway, Cadherin signaling pathway, etc. Gene functional categories, particularly involved in muscle contraction, muscle organ development, cytoskeleton as well as calcium ion binding were identified. Furthermore, some of transcription factors such as Myf6, Tead4, Cebpd were activated. These data proved that E15.5 was the early differentiation and maturation stage of tongue, meanwhile, cytoskeleton, structural constituent of cytoskeleton, transcription factor activity, calcium ion related activity were involved in cell motion, muscle organ development and muscle contraction, through transcription factors and the interaction of Wnt pathway with Hedgehog pathway. It had highlighted potential cascades and important candidates for further investigation on the genetic mechanism and clinical therapy of tongue related diseases.

AB Aim. Recent findings highlight the critical role of the Wnt signaling pathway in cardiac repair and stem cell regulation. Our previous study shows that lithium chloride (LiCl) optimizes skeletal myoblast (SkM) for transplantation by mimicking the Wnt/beta catenin signaling activities. In this study, we evaluate the therapeutic potential of SkMs genetically modified with Wnt1gene (Wnt1 SkMs) in a rat model with myocardial infarction (MI).
   Methods. We harvested neonatal SkMs using Wistar rats (13 day old) transfected with p EGFP C3 Wnt1 plasmid. RTPCR and immunofluorescence showed a higher expression of Wnt1 in the Wnt1 SkMs. We observed that Wnt1 SkMs increased connexin 43 (Cx43) expression, reduced apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide (11202) and decreased caspase 3 expression via the canonical Wnt signaling pathways compared to the empty vector transfected SkMs (control SkMs). For in vivo studies, the myocardial infarction model was developed in the Wistar rats. The rats were grouped to receive 100 mu L basal DMEM without cells or containing 1.5x10(6)SkMs and Wnt1 SkMs. Histological studies revealed improved survival of SkMs, reduced cardiomyocytes apoptosis, and upregulated expression of Cx43 in Wnt1 SkMs therapy group. Echocardiography monitored four weeks after therapy showed improvement of the left ventricular function in rats treated with Wnt1SkMs compared to other groups.
   Conclusion. Transplantation of Wnt1 SkMs improves rat myocardial function and enhances anti apoptotic properties of both SkMs and cardiomyocytes and upregulation of tissue Cx43 after infarction via the canonical Wnt/beta catenin signaling activities.

AB It is presently thought that osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a cytokine involved in the regulation of osteoblast/osteoclast crosstalk and maintenance of bone mass. Recent studies showed that GH replacement therapy in GH deficient patients was able to induce a significant increase of OPG in the plasma, as well as in the cortical and the trabecular bone. In order to determine whether GH could directly modulate OPG secretion, the effect of GH on human osteoblast like cells (hOB) in primary culture was studied. After detecting the presence of the mRNA for the GH receptor (GHR) by RT PCR, hOB were exposed to increasing concentrations of GH, from 0 1 to 25 ng/ml, for 24 h. The results showed that GH exposure was able to stimulate OPG secretion in a concentration dependent manner. In addition, the OPG mRNA levels were increased, indicating that the hormone has a stimulatory effect on gene expression. The stimulatory effect on OPG expression and production was prevented by exposing the cells to tyrphostin AG490 (10 mu M), an inhibitor of Janus kinase 2, which is one of the kinases involved in the intracellular pathway activated by the binding of GH to its receptor. Similar results were obtained when the cells were exposed to a receptor antagonist of GH, pegvisomant at 50 nM. GH exposure neither induced an increase in IGF I expression nor secretion in hOB. These results suggest that the stimulation of OPG production induced by GH in hOB is specific and receptor mediated and further support the view that GH is able to modulate bone remodeling by directly influencing osteoblast osteoclast crosstalk.

AB Metastatic bone disease (MBD) is a common complication of advanced cancer and recent research suggests that Endo180 expression is dysregulated through the TGF beta TGF beta R SMAD2/3 signalling pathway during the invasion of tumour cells in the development of MBD. We here provide a model for the dysregulation of the Endo180 network to demonstrate its vital contribution to bone destruction as well as tumour cell growth. The model consisted of a set of ordinary differential equations and reconstructed variations in the bone cells, resultant bone volume, and biochemical factors involved in the TGF beta TGF beta R SMAD2/3 signalling pathway over time. The model also investigated the underlying mechanism in which the change of TGF beta affects the TGF beta TGF beta R SMAD2/3 signalling pathway and the resultant Endo180 expression in osteoblastic and tumour cells. The model links the appearance of tumour cells with the inhibition of TGF beta binding to its receptors on osteoblastic cells, to affect TGF beta TGF beta R SMAD2/3 signalling and Endo180 expression. Temporal variation in bone cells, bone volume, and the biochemical factors involved in the TGF beta TGF beta R SMAD2/3 pathway as demonstrated in the model simulations agree with published experimental data. The model can be refined based on further discoveries but allows the influence of Endo180 network dysregulation on bone remodelling in MBD to be established. This model could aid in the development of Endo180 targeted therapies for MBD in the future.

AB Periodontitis is a widely prevalent oral disease around the world characterized by the disruption of the periodontal ligament and the subsequent development of periodontal pockets, as well as the loss of alveolar bone, and may eventually lead to tooth loss. This research aims to assess the suppressive impact of Eupatilin, a flavone obtained from Artemisia argyi, on osteoclastogenesis in vitro and periodontitis in vivo. . We found that Eupatilin can efficiently obstruct the differentiation of Raw264.7 and bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) induced by RANKL, leading to the formation of mature osteoclasts. Consistently, bone slice resorption assay showed that Eupatilin significantly inhibited osteoclast mediated bone resorption in a dose dependent manner. Eupatilin also downregulated the expression of osteoclast specific genes and proteins in Raw264.7 and BMDMs. RNA sequencing showed that Eupatilin notably downregulated the expression of Siglec 15. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses identified significantly enriched pathways in DEGs, including MAPK signaling pathway. And further mechanistic investigations confirmed that Eupatilin repressed MAPKs/NF kappa B kappa B signaling pathways. It was found that Siglec 15 overexpression reversed the inhibitory impact of Eupatilin on the differentiation of osteoclasts. Furthermore, activating MAPK signaling pathway reversed the downregulation of Siglec 15 and the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis by Eupatilin. To sum up, Eupatilin reduced the expression of Siglec 15 by suppressing MAPK signaling pathway, ultimately leading to the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. Meanwhile, Eupatilin suppressed the alveolar bone resorption caused by experimental periodontitis in vivo. . Eupatilin exhibits potential therapeutic effects in the treatment of periodontitis, rendering it a promising pharmaceutical agent.

AB Background/Aim: Multiple myeloma is still an incurable hematological malignancy of monoclonal B lymphocytes. While standard chemotherapy regimens have been used for years, novel agents like lenalidomide and bortezomib have become an essential part of today's therapies and significantly improve therapeutic efficacy. Nevertheless, new therapeutic strategies are still indispensable. Aberrant activation of Wnt/beta catenin signaling promotes development of several cancers. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the Wnt pathway is activated in both lymphoma and myeloma. Thus, Wnt signaling molecules are attractive candidates for the development of new targeted therapies. Naftifine was used in the present study since it has chemical features similar to those of other known WNT inhibitors. Materials and Methods: The anti tumor apoptotic effect of naftifine at doses ranging from 0.1 200 mu M was investigated on two human and one murine lymphoma, as well as in one murine and three human myeloma cell lines, and determinded by the 3 (4,5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl) 2,5 diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. Results: Naftifine significantly reduced cell viability in all tested myeloma and lymphoma cell lines in a dose dependent manner, while healthy cells were only slightly affected. Conclusion: Naftifine exhibits toxicity to hematological neoplasms in vitro.

AB Background: Bisphosphonates (BPs) and denosumab are widely used to treat osteoporosis and complications associated with bone metastases. However, medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a serious problem.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency, outcome, and characteristics of patients with drug induced MRONJ.
   Methods: Retrospective pharmacovigilance disproportionality analysis was conducted using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database from the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency. Adverse event reports submitted to JADER between 2004 and 2017 were analyzed, and the reporting odds ratio (ROR) was calculated.
   Results: Among the BPs that cause MRONJ, zoledronate was the most common; therefore, we compared the characteristics of cases of MRONJ induced by zoledronate with those induced by denosumab. Among the 3,875 (68.1% women) cases of MRONJ, zoledronate related MRONJ accounted for 1,283 (56.0% women) and denosumab related MRONJ accounted for 322 (55.3% women). MRONJ was more frequent after 70 years of age regardless of the use of either zoledronate or denosumab; onset occurred after 1 year from the denosumab treatment, but it is unknown when onset occurred after zoledronate treatment. The outcomes for MRONJ were poor, with 406 reports on zoledronate (31.6%) and 152 reports on denosumab (47.2%) demonstrating nonrecovery. Zoledronate (ROR: 319.3, 95% CI: 296.0 344.4) had the highest ROR among BP agents. Denosumab had a high ROR (ROR: 155.2, 95% CI: 136.5 176.3). Zoledronate and denosumab were used in similar patient backgrounds, and their use resulted in a similar frequency of MRONJ.
   Conclusion: The findings of this comprehensive evaluation of MRONJ using the JADER database will be helpful for prescribing medications to elderly patients.

AB Cancer is a complicated and diverse family of diseases characterized by the body's aberrant cells growing and spreading out of control. It is one of the major causes of mortality in the world and may affect almost every organ or tissue in the body. One of the most prevalent forms of malignant tumors that affect both men and women is bone cancer. The study introduces the soluble frizzled related protein SFRP3 as a significant participant. It functions as a tumor suppressor and regulator as well as an antagonist of the Wnt signaling pathway. It interacts directly with Wnts, regulating Wnt signaling and directing cell proliferation and differentiation in certain cell types. The study focuses on SFRP3 as a possible target for bone cancer therapy. The purpose is to find prospective medication candidates. Several databases are listed as possible drug compound sources, including NCI_Natural Products, Enamine, and specifications. Potent drugs from the selected databases are scrutinized and identified using ligand based pharmacophore modeling. The binding affinity and interactions between the selected compounds and the SFRP3 modeled protein are evaluated using virtual screening and molecular docking approaches. The selection of lead compounds is based on their scores, binding affinity, and interactions, which indicate their potential as therapeutic candidates. To ensure that the contacts stay stable throughout time, molecular dynamics modeling is used to analyze the stability of the Protein Ligand complex. The investigation leads to the identification of the top three compounds from each of the three databases that show potential against the target protein, SFRP3.

AB Osteoporosis is a devastating disease that features reduced bone quantity and microstructure, which causes fragility fracture and increases mortality, especially in the aged population. Due to the long term side effects of current drugs for osteoporosis, it is of importance to find other safe and effective medications. Ellagic acid (EA) is a phenolic compound found in nut galls, plant extracts, and fruits, and exhibits antioxidant and antineoplastic effects. Here, we showed that EA attenuated the formation and function of osteoclast dose dependently. The underlying mechanism was further discovered by western blot, immunofluorescence assay, and luciferase assay, which elucidated that EA suppressed osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption mainly through attenuating receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) ligand induced NF kappa B activation and extracellular signal regulated kinase signaling pathways, accompanied by decreased protein expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells calcineurin dependent 1 and c Fos. Moreover, EA inhibits osteoclast marker genes expression including Dc stamp, Ctsk, Atp6v0d2, and Acp5. Intriguingly, we also found that EA treatment could significantly protect ovariectomy induced bone loss in vivo. Conclusively, this study suggested that EA might have the therapeutic potentiality for preventing or treating osteoporosis.

AB Berberine (BBR) has recently been reported to be extensively used for musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoporosis through enhancing osteogenic differentiation, inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption and repressing adipogenesis. Although canonical Wnt signaling plays a crucial role in suppressing bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) commitment to the chondrogenic and adipogenic lineage and enhancing osteogenic differentiation, no previous reports have shown an association between BBR induced osteogenesis and Wnt/beta catenin signaling pathway. In this study, we aimed to investigate the stimulatory effect and the mechanism of BBR on osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow derived MSCs. MSCs were isolated from bone marrow specimens and treated with different concentration of BBR. Cell viability was measured by the WST 8 assay. Effects of BBR on osteogenic differentiation of MSCs were assessed by von Kossa staining, ALP staining and ALP activity. Osteogenic specific genes, chondrogenic and adipogenic related marker genes were determined by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction analysis. Western blot and Immunofluorescence staining were performed to analyze OCN and OPN, and beta catenin expression in the presence or absence of BBR combined with DKK 1 or beta catenin siRNA transfection. Increasing concentration of BBR (3, 10 and 30 mu M) promoted osteogenic differentiation and osteogenic genes expression after incubation for various days compared with DMSO group, whereas expression levels of chondrogenic and adipogenic related marker genes were dramatically suppressed. After treated with 10 mu M BBR for 7 days, beta catenin, OPN and OCN expression were significantly induced, which could be effectively suppressed by the addition of DKK 1 or beta catenin siRNA beta catenin. Interestingly, the expression level of Runx2 gene was also decreased by inhibiting the transduction of Wnt/beta catenin signaling. These findings suggest that BBR can stimulate osteogenic differentiation of MSCs not only by enhancing Runx2 expression but also by activating canonical Wnt/beta catenin signaling pathway, and canonical Wnt/beta catenin signaling pathway is in part responsible for BBR induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in vitro. BBR is a potential pharmaceutical medicine by enhancing osteogenic differentiation for bone disorders, such as osteoporosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Reduced bone mineral density (osteopenia) is a poorly characterized manifestation of pediatric and adult patients afflicted with Marfan syndrome (MFS), a multisystem disorder caused by structural or quantitative defects in fibrillin 1 that perturb tissue integrity and TGF beta bioavailability. Here we report that mice with progressively severe MFS (Fbn1(mgR/mgR) mice) develop osteopenia associated with normal osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. In vivo and ex vivo experiments, respectively, revealed that adult Fbn1(mgR/mgR) mice respond more strongly to locally induced osteolysis and that Fbn1(mgR/mgR) osteoblasts stimulate pre osteoclast differentiation more than wild type cells. Greater osteoclastogenic potential of mutant osteoblasts was largely attributed to Rankl up regulation secondary to improper TGF beta activation and signaling. Losartan treatment, which lowers TGF beta signaling and restores aortic wall integrity in mice with mild MFS, did not mitigate bone loss in Fbn1(mgR/mgR) mice even though it ameliorated vascular disease. Conversely, alendronate treatment, which restricts osteoclast activity, improved bone quality but not aneurysm progression in Fbn1(mgR/mgR) mice. Taken together, our findings shed new light on the pathogenesis of osteopenia in MFS, in addition to arguing for a multifaceted treatment strategy in this congenital disorder of the connective tissue.

AB IKK beta is indispensable for inflammatory osteolysis, the functional residues of IKK beta are therapeutic drug targets for developing inhibitors to treat multiple diseases now. Thus it remains appealing to find the new residues of IKK beta to influence osteoclasts for alleviating bone loss diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). By employing IKK beta cysteine 46 A transgenic (IKK beta(C46A)) mice, we found that mutation of cysteine 46 to alanine in IKK beta exacerbated inflammatory bone destruction in vivo, and increased osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption ex vivo and in vitro. Consistent with these, IKK beta kinase activity as well as c Fos, NFATc1 were up regulated in bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) from IKK beta(C46A) mice during RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis. Of interesting, we further identified and demonstrated that the expressions of mPGES 1 and caveolin 1 were heightened in BMMs of IKK beta(C46A) mice compared to those in WT mice in RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis. Together, it revealed that mutating cysteine 46 in IKK beta could increase caveolin 1 and mPGES 1 expression to facilitate osteoclast differentiation and osteolysis. Cysteine 46 can serve as a novel target in IKK beta for designing inhibitors to treat osteolysis.

AB Orthopedic prostheses are the ultimate therapeutic solution for various end stage orthopedic conditions. However, aseptic loosening and pyogenic infections remain as primary complications associated with these devices. In this study, a hierarchical titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanotube drug delivery system loaded with cinnamaldehyde for the surface modification of titanium implants, is constructed. These specially designed dual layer TiO2 nanotubes enhance material reactivity and provide an extensive drug loading platform within a short time. The introduction of cinnamaldehyde enhances the bone integration performance of the scaffold (simultaneously promoting bone formation and inhibiting bone resorption), anti inflammatory capacity, and antibacterial properties. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that this system promoted osteogenesis by upregulating both Wnt/beta catenin and MAPK signaling pathways. Furthermore, it inhibits osteoclast formation, suppresses macrophage mediated inflammatory responses, and impedes the proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. In vivo experiments shows that this material enhances bone integration in a rat model of femoral defects. In addition, it effectively enhances the antibacterial and anti inflammatory properties in a subcutaneous implant in a rat model. This study provides a straightforward and highly effective surface modification strategy for orthopedic Ti implants.

AB We have previously observed that Wnt signaling activates a fibrogenic program in adult muscle stem cells, called satellite cells, during aging. We genetically labeled satellite cells in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy to follow their fate during the progression of the disease. We observed that a fraction of satellite cells had a reduced myogenic potential and showed enhanced expression of profibrotic genes compared to age matched controls. By combining in vitro and in vivo results, we found that expression of transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF beta 2) was induced in response to elevated canonical Wnt signaling in dystrophic muscles and that the resulting increase in TGF beta activity affected the behavior of satellite cells in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of the TGF beta pathway in vivo reduced the fibrogenic characteristics of satellite cells. These studies shed new light on the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for stem cell dysfunction in dystrophic muscle and may contribute to the development of more effective and specific therapeutic approaches for the prevention of muscle fibrosis.

AB Bone metastases are severely debilitating and have a significant impact on the quality of life of women with metastatic breast cancer. Treatment options are limited and in order to develop more targeted therapies, improved understanding of the complex mechanisms that lead to bone lesion development are warranted. Interestingly, whilst prostate derived bone metastases are characterised by mixed or osteoblastic lesions, breast derived bone metastases are characterised by osteolytic lesions, suggesting unique regulatory patterns. This study aimed to measure the changes in bone formation and bone resorption activity at two time points (18 and 36 days) during development of the bone lesion following intratibial injection of MDA MB 231 human breast cancer cells into the left tibiae of Severely Combined Immuno Deficient (SCID) mice. The contralateral tibia was used as a control. Tibiae were extracted and processed for undecalcified histomorphometric analysis. We provide evidence that the early bone loss observed following exposure to MDA MB 231 cells was due to a significant reduction in mineral apposition rate, rather than increased levels of bone resorption. This suggests that osteoblast activity was impaired in the presence of breast cancer cells, contrary to previous reports of osteoclast dependent bone loss. Furthermore mRNA expression of Dickkopf Homolog 1 (DKK 1) and Noggin were confirmed in the MDA MB 231 cell line, both of which antagonise osteoblast regulatory pathways. The observed bone loss following injection of cancer cells was due to an overall thinning of the trabecular bone struts rather than perforation of the bone tissue matrix (as measured by trabecular width and trabecular separation, respectively), suggesting an opportunity to reverse the cancer induced bone changes. These novel insights into the mechanisms through which osteolytic bone lesions develop may be important in the development of new treatment strategies for metastatic breast cancer patients.

AB Regeneration of bone defects in diabetic patients has always been a significant challenge in clinical treatment. The pathologic diabetic micromilieu, characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, cellular senescence, and chronic inflammation, compromises innate bone healing capacity. 3D cryo printing technology is utilized in bone tissue engineering to fabricate hierarchical porous scaffolds that promote a conducive microenvironment for cellular adhesion, migration, proliferation, and nutrient exchange. Nanozymes are used as synthetic mimics of natural enzymes to scavenge ROS, addressing the limitations of natural antioxidative enzymes. To remodel the diabetic bone regeneration micromilieu, a 3D cryo printed polyaryletherketone with carboxyl groups (PAEK COOH) and 45S5 bioactive glass (BG) hierarchical porous scaffold (PBG scaffold), harmonized with hybrid nanozymes comprising SS31 enhanced manganese dioxide (MnO2) ferritin biomimetic nanozyme (MF@S nanozyme), is developed for combinatorial mitochondrial therapy. The MF@S nanozyme specifically targets mitochondria to enhance mitochondrial function, scavenge ROS accumulated in mitochondria, and suppress mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) production, and thus rejuvenate aging cells, regulate macrophage polarization, and modulate differentiation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. This 3D cryo printed PBG MF@S hierarchical porous scaffold combines with a combinatorial mitochondrial therapy system to remodel the diabetic micromilieu and presents a promising therapeutic approach for the regeneration of bone defects in diabetes.
   A 3D cryo printed PAEK COOH and BG hierarchical porous scaffold (PBG scaffold), combined with MF@S nanozymes, is developed for combinatorial mitochondrial therapy. The MF@S nanozyme effectively scavenges ROS, improves mitochondrial function, rejuvenates senescent cells, regulates macrophage polarization, promotes osteoblast differentiation, and inhibits osteoclast differentiation. This approach shows potential for bone defect regeneration in diabetes. image

AB Glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis is the most frequent form of secondary osteoporosis caused by chronic exposure to glucocorticoid excess. Pathogenesis of glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis is multifactorial including direct effects of glucocorticoids on bone cells and indirect effects of glucocorticoids on several neuroendocrine and metabolic pathways. Fragility fractures occur early in glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis and anti osteoporotic drugs along with calcium and vitamin D should be started soon after exposure to glucocorticoid excess. This paper summarizes some of the main topics discussed during the 9th Glucocorticoid Induced Osteoporosis Meeting (Rome, April 2016) with a specific focus on the role of growth hormone/insulin like growth factor 1 and parathyroid hormone/vitamin D axes in the pathogenesis of glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis and the controversial aspects concerning therapeutic approach to skeletal fragility in this clinical setting.

AB Bone resorption is seminal for the physiological remodeling of bone during life. However, this process needs to be strictly controlled; excessive bone resorption results in pathologic bone loss, osteoporosis, and fracture. We describe a control mechanism of bone resorption by the adaptive immune system. CD80/86, a pair of molecules expressed by antigen presenting cells and involved in T cell costimulation, act as negative regulator for the generation of bone resorbing osteoclasts. CD80/86 deficient mice were osteopenic because of increased osteoclast differentiation. CD80/86 deficient osteoclasts escaped physiological inhibition by CTLA 4 or regulatory T cells. Mechanistically, engagement of CD80/86 by CTLA 4 induced activation of the enzyme indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) in osteoclast precursors, which degraded tryptophan and promoted apoptosis. Concordantly, IDO deficient mice also showed an osteopenic bone phenotype with higher numbers of osteoclast precursors and osteoclasts. Also, IDO deficient mononuclear cells escaped the anti osteoclastogenic effect of CTLA 4. This molecular mechanism was also present in humans because targeting CD80/86 by abatacept, a CTLA 4 immunoglobulin fusion protein, reduced, whereas blockade of CTLA 4 by ipilimumab antibody enhanced, the frequency of peripheral osteoclast precursors and osteoclastogenesis. In summary, these data show an important role of the adaptive immune system, in particular T cell CD80/86 costimulation molecules, in the physiological regulation of bone resorption and preservation of bone mass, as well as affect the understanding of the function of current and future drugs fostering or blocking the effects of CTLA 4 in humans.

AB Human amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells (hAFMSCs) are promising for therapeutic applications in bone damage. Calcium sensing receptor (CaSR), a G protein coupled receptor, plays a physiological role in the regulation of bone metabolism. Thus, the bone CaSR could be targeted by calcimimetic agonists, which may be potentially helpful in treating bone diseases. The aim of our study was to characterize CaSR expression in hAFMSCs and to assess the activity of calcimimetic R 568 during in vitro osteogenesis. Using western blotting, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry, we consistently observed constitutive CaSR in osteo differentiating hAFMSCs. Notably, both R 568 and calcium significantly enhanced hAFMSC osteogenic differentiation after exposure to osteogenic medium. To provide further evidence of the involvement of CaSR in osteogenesis, we correlated its expression with that of established osteogenic markers, that is, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and osteopontin (OPN), and novel, not yet completely defined regulators of osteogenesis. Among these are beta catenin and Slug, which are mediators of Wnt signaling, and nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), which plays a critical role in calcium/calcineurin signaling. Taken together, our results demonstrate that CaSR is expressed in hAFMSCs, positively correlates with osteogenic markers, and is activated by R 568. Notably, downregulation of CaSR by RNA interference supports the conclusion that CaSR activation plays a central role in hAFMSC osteogenesis. Thus, this study provides significant information on the mechanisms of hAFMSC osteogenesis, which could provide additional molecular basis for the use of calcimimetics in bone regenerative medicine.

AB Epirubicin (EPI) is a broad spectrum antineoplastic drug, commonly used as a chemotherapy method to treat osteosarcoma. However, its application has been limited by many side effects. Therefore, targeted drug delivery to bone has been the aim of current anti bone tumor drug studies. Due to the exceptional affinity of Bisphosphonates (BP) to bone, 1 amino ethylene 1, 1 dephosphate acid (AEDP) was chosen as the bone targeting moiety for water soluble macromolecular drug delivery systems of oxidized dextran (OXD) to transport EPI to bone in this article. The bone targeting drug of AEDP OXD EPI was designed for the treatment of malignant bone tumors. The successful conjugation of AEDP OXD EPI was confirmed by analysis of FTIR and 1 H NMR spectra. To study the bone seeking potential of AEDP OXD EPI, an in vitro hydroxyapatite (HAp) binding assay and an in vivo experiment of bone targeting capacity were established. The effectiveness of AEDP OXD EPI was demonstrated by inducing apoptosis and necrosis of MG 63 tumor cell line. The obtained experimental data indicated that AEDP OXD EPI is an ideal bone targeting anti tumor drug.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Wenshen Zhuanggu Formula (WSZG), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) empirical prescription, has been used to treat the patients with breast cancer bone metastasis as an adjuvant in clinical practice. To explore the anti metastatic activity and potential mechanisms of WSZG containing serum (WSZG CS) on highly bone metastatic human breast cancer MDA MB 231BO cells.
   Materials and methods: MDA MB 231BO cells were cultured alone or co cultured with bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Invasion assays were carried out in Matrigel coated Transwell chambers. CC chemokine 5 (CCL5) and interleukin (IL) 17B secretion levels were detected by ELISA. CCR5 and IL 17BR protein expression levels were determined by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis.
   Results: Compared with control serum, WSZG CS significantly inhibited BMSC induced MDA MB 231B0 breast cancer cell invasion, reduced CCL5 and IL 17B levels in co culture supernatants, and down regulated CCR5 and IL 17BR protein expression in breast cancer cells co cultured with BMSCs.
   Conclusions: WSZG CS exerts an anti metastatic activity against MDA MB 231B0 breast cancer cells, due to its ability to mitigate the interaction between BMSCs and breast cancer cells mediated via the CCL5/CCR5 and IL 17B/IL 17BR signaling pathways.

AB Although rhein and NSAIDs are potent anti inflammatory drugs, their use has been limited by the high incidence of gastrointestinal erosions and the necessity to deliver the drug to specific sites of target organ. Using the prodrug approach, a series of rhein NSAIDs prodrugs containing anthraquinone bone targeting moiety were synthesized by linking rhein with NSAIDs through glycol ester. The target compounds demonstrated significant capability of binding to HAP and were hydrolytically activated in physiological conditions. Hybrid rhein NSAIDs prodrugs exhibited significant anti inflammatory activity, moreover, the tested compounds were also found to possess less degree of ulcerogenic potential. Our pharmacokinetic studies of 7e demonstrated this prodrug is a potential candidate for a slower and sustained release form of rhein. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Background Globally, bone fractures are the most common musculoskeletal trauma, and approximately 8 10% of cases that fall into the categories of delayed or non union healing. To date, there are no efficient pharmacological agents to accelerate the healing of bone fractures. Thus, it is necessary to find new strategies that accelerate bone healing and reduce the incidence of non union or delayed fracture healing. Previous studies have revealed that the plasminogen activation system has been demonstrated to play an important role in bone metabolism. However, the function of SERPINB2 in the osteogenesis of hBMSCs remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects and mechanism of SERPINB2 on osteogenic differentiation. Methods We investigated the osteogenesis effects of hBMSCs by both exogenous SerpinB2 protein and SERPINB2 gene silencing in vitro. Cell proliferation assay was used to assess the effect of exogenous SerpinB2 or SERPINB2 silencing on proliferation of hBMSCs. qPCR and Western blotting analysis detected the expression of target genes and proteins respectively. ALP staining was used to evaluated ALP activity and Alizarin Red staining (ARS) was used to evaluate mineral deposition. In vivo, a murie tibial fracture model was established, histological evaluation and radiographic analysis was used to confirm the therapeutic effects of SERPINB2 silencing in fracture healing. Statistical significance between two groups was determined by Student's t test, one way ANOVA or Bonferroni's post hoc test according to the distribution of the tested population. Results The addition of exogenous SerpinB2 protein inhibted osteoblast differentiation of hBMSCs in vitro, while SERPINB2 gene silencing significant promote osteoblast differentiation of hBMSCs in vitro. And silenced SERPINB2 gene also increased mineral deposits. Moreover, beta catenin levels were up regulated by SERPINB2 gene depletion. And the enhancement of osteogenic differentiation induced by SERPINB2 silencing was almost inhibited by specific Wnt/beta catenin signaling pathway inhibitor. In a murine tibial fracture model, local injection of SERPINB2 siRNA improved bone fracture healing. Conclusions Taken together, these findings indicate that SERPINB2 silencing promoted osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs via the Wnt/beta catenin signaling pathway, and silenced SERPINB2 in vivo effectively promotes fracture healing, suggesting that SERPINB2 may be a novel target for bone fracture healing.

AB The specification of pluripotent stem cells into the bone forming osteoblasts has been explored in a number of studies. However, the current body of literature has yet to adequately address the role of Wnt glycoproteins in the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells along the osteogenic lineage. During mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) in vitro osteogenesis, the noncanonical WNT5a is expressed early on. Cells either sorted by their positive WNT5a expression or when supplemented with recombinant WNT5a (rWNT5a) during a 2 day window showed significantly enhanced osteogenic yield. Mechanistically, rWNT5a supplementation upregulated protein kinase C (PKC), calcium/calmodulin dependent kinase II (CamKII) and c Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) activity while antagonizing the key effector of canonical Wnt signaling: beta catenin. Conversely, when recombinant WNT3a (rWNT3a) or other positive regulators of beta catenin were employed during this same time window there was a decrease in osteogenic marker expression. However, if rWNT3a was supplemented during a time window following rWNT5a treatment, osteogenic differentiation was enhanced both in murine and human ESCs. Elucidating the role of these WNT ligands in directing the early stages of osteogenesis has the potential to considerably improve tissue engineering protocols and applications for regenerative medicine.

AB Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells are an active area of research due to their therapeutic potential in treating osteoporosis. To further harness their therapeutic performance in modulating bone resorption, equipped exosomes with osteoclast targeting moieties on their surface as well as chemokine receptor antagonists blocking osteoclast recruitment. Phosphatidylserine (PS), a membrane lipid exerting immunosuppressive and phagocytic signals, is incorporated in the membrane of exosome mimetics (EMs) to achieve a marked affinity for osteoclast precursors and potential anti resorptive effects. This is also aimed to tackle a CXCL9 CXCR3 ligand receptor axis, a critical signaling axis in regulating osteoclast precursor recruitment and differentiation at bone resorption sites, by encapsulating a chemical antagonist of CXCR3, AMG487, in the PS incorporated EMs (PS EMs). The osteoclast targeting PS EMs loaded with AMG487 effectively protected against bone loss in an ovariectomized mouse model. These findings demonstrate the great promise of PS EMs as anti resorptive nanotherapies for alleviating osteoporosis.

AB Osteoclasts uniquely resorb calcified bone matrices. To exert their function, mature osteoclasts maintain the cellular polarity and directional vesicle trafficking to and from the resorbing bone surface. However, the regulatory mechanisms and pathophysiological relevance of these processes remain largely unexplored. Bone histomorphometric analyses in Ccr5 deficient mice showed abnormalities in the morphology and functional phenotype of their osteoclasts, compared to wild type mice. We observed disorganized clustering of nuclei, as well as centrosomes that organize the microtubule network, which was concomitant with impaired cathepsin K secretion in cultured Ccr5 deficient osteoclasts. Intriguingly, forced expression of constitutively active Rho or Rac restored these cytoskeletal phenotypes with recovery of cathepsin K secretion. Furthermore, a gene disease enrichment analysis identified that PLEKHM1, a responsible gene for osteopetrosis, which regulates lysosomal trafficking in osteoclasts, was regulated by CCR5. These experimental results highlighted that CCR5 mediated signaling served as an intracellular organizer for centrosome clustering in osteoclasts, which was involved in the pathophysiology of bone metabolism.

AB Objective: The network pharmacology method was adopted in this study to establish the relationship between "Efficacy of ingredients disease targets biological pathway" and screening the targets of the wenshenxuanbi decoction of the treatments for osteoarthritis and clarifying its mechanism of treatment. Methods: Chemical components and selected targets related to eleven herbs were searched in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform. In the GeneCards database, the OMIM database, and the DisGeNET database, osteoarthritis disease targets were searched. Then we screened the core targets between the drugs and the disease by identifying the intersections. Then an interaction network diagram of the targets was constructed using String. The GO Enrichment and KEGG enrichment analyses of the targets were analyzed based on the DAVID database. Results: Selecting oral bioavailability >= 30% and drug likeness >= 0.18 as search filters, 181 active ingredients and 134 corresponding protein targets were screened for the wenshenxuanbi decoction. There were 72 core genes that intersected with 2171 disease related genes in OA. The GO analysis contained a total of 304 enrichment results, including 211 biological processes, 42 cell compositions, and 51 molecular functions. A total of 73 pathways were enriched by KEGG. This study predicted the main possible mechanisms of wenshenxuanbi decoction in treating OA, including anti inflammation, regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, promoting the balance between osteogenesis and osteoclasts, and antioxidation.

AB BACKGROUND Conventional Crohn's disease (CD) treatments are supportive rather than curative and have serious side effects. Adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) have been gradually applied to treat various diseases. The therapeutic effect and underlying mechanism of ADSCs on CD are still not clear. AIM To investigate the effect of ADSC administration on CD and explore the potential mechanisms. METHODS Wistar rats were administered with 2,4,6 trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) to establish a rat model of CD, followed by tail injections of green fluorescent protein (GFP) modified ADSCs. Flow cytometry, qRT PCR, and Western blot were used to detect changes in the Wnt signaling pathway, T cell subtypes, and their related cytokines. RESULTS The isolated cells showed the characteristics of ADSCs, including spindle shaped morphology, high expression of CD29, CD44, and CD90, low expression of CD34 and CD45, and osteogenic/adipogenic ability. ADSC therapy markedly reduced disease activity index and ameliorated colitis severity in the TNBS induced rat model of CD. Furthermore, serum anti sacchromyces cerevisiae antibody and p anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody levels were significantly reduced in ADSC treated rats. Mechanistically, the GFP ADSCs were colocalized with intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in the CD rat model. GFP ADSC delivery significantly antagonized TNBS induced increased canonical Wnt pathway expression, decreased noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway expression, and increased apoptosis rates and protein level of cleaved caspase 3 in rats. In addition, ADSCs attenuated TNBS induced abnormal inflammatory cytokine production, disturbed T cell subtypes, and their related markers in rats. CONCLUSION Successfully isolated ADSCs show therapeutic effects in CD by regulating IEC proliferation, the Wnt signaling pathway, and T cell immunity.

TI Crystal structure of the PDZ domain of mouse Dishevelled 1 and its

AB Dishevelled (Dvl) plays a crucial role in Wnt signaling by interacting with membrane bound receptors and downstream molecules through its PDZ domain. CXXC5 is one of the key molecules that interacts with Dvl and negatively regulates the Wnt/13 catenin pathway in osteoblast differentiation. Recently, the Dvl CXXC5 interaction has been identified as an excellent target for osteoporosis treatment. Therefore, it is desirable to have detailed structural information for the Dvl CXXC5 interaction. Although solution structures of the Dvll PDZ domain have been reported, a high resolution crystal structure would provide detailed sidechain information that is essential for drug development. Here, we determined the first crystal structure of the Dvl 1 PDZ domain at a resolution of 1.76 A, and compared it with its previously reported solution structure. The Dvll PDZ domain crystal belonged to the space group H32 with unit cell parameters a = b = 72.837, c = 120.616, alpha = beta = 90.00, gamma = 120.00. The crystal structure of Dvll PDZ shared its topology with the previously reported structure determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR); however, the crystal structure was quite different from the solution structure in both the secondary structural region and the ligand binding pocket. Molecular modeling based on NMR and X ray crystallographic data yielded detailed information about the Dvll /CXXC5 interaction, which will be useful for designing inhibitors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Extracorporeal shock wave treatment (ESWT) is successfully used in various musculoskeletal disorders and pathologies. Despite the increasing use of this kind of therapy, some aspects of its mechanism of action are still unclear. In vitro bone cell behavior under ESWT were previously investigated by the present author and MG63 osteoblast like cells showed an enhancement in proliferation and in the osteoblast differentiation after therapy with a low energy flux density. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of ESWT on the permeabilization of cell membrane. We characterized physiological changes in the MG63 associated with ESWT generated by an ESW device and patch clamp recording was performed to study ion channels. Experiments were carried out using the whole cell recording configuration of the patch clamp technique and the ionic current measurements were performed on cell samples of ESW treated and control groups. The patch clamp technique showed the effect of ESWT on the amplitude of transmembrane currents. The treatment with ESW enhanced the transmembrane current as well the voltage dependence of Ca activated and K channels that mediate these currents: the differences between treated cells and control at 80mV were over 1000 pA (p < 0.05). These modifications of ion channels activity positively influence cell proliferation (MTT test, p < 0.0001) without interfering with the normal synthesis activity of stimulated osteoblasts.

AB Background: Until fairly recently, cathepsin K was recognized solely as a bone resorbing enzyme expressed selectively in the osteoclast. Evidence of its requirement for normal bone remodeling has resulted in this protease receiving considerable attention from the pharmaceutical industry. In the last decade, intense research efforts were aimed at development of cathepsin K inhibitors for treatment of osteoporosis and other skeletal disorders associated with pathological bone loss. Emerging new evidence suggests that in addition to bone resorption, cathepsin K is involved in the turnover of extracellular matrix proteins in organs, such as the lung, thyroid and skin, and plays important roles in cardiovascular disease, inflammation and obesity. Discussion: This review highlights the physiological and pathophysiological implications of this potent protease, with a focus on recent developments in the design and use of cathepsin K inhibitors to target skeletal pathologies. Therapeutic implications of anticathepsin K drugs in the context of common links between bone disease and atherosclerosis are also discussed. Conclusion: The association of cathepsin K with skeletal and cardiovascular disorders offers intriguing future applications for inhibitors of this potent protease.

AB Osteoporosis is a common chronic metabolic bone disease characterized by reduced trabecular bone and increased bone fragility. Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is a lipolytic enzyme to catalyze the hydrolysis of monoglycerides and specifically degrades the 2 arachidonoyl glycerol (2 AG). Previous studies have identified that 2 AG is the mainly source for arachidonic acid and the most abundant endogenous agonist of cannabinoid receptors. Considering the close relationship between inflammatory mediators/cannabinoid receptors and bone metabolism, we speculated that MAGL may play a role in the osteoclast differentiation. In the present study, we found that MAGL protein expression increased during osteoclast differentiation. MAGL knockdown by adenovirus mediated shRNA in bone marrow derived macrophages demonstrated the suppressive effects of MAGL on osteoclast formation and bone resorption. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of MAGL by JZL184 suppressed osteoclast differentiation, bone resorption, and osteoclast specific gene expression. Activation of the Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) pathways was inhibited by JZL184 and deletion of MAGL. Our in vivo study indicated that JZL184 ameliorated bone loss in an ovariectomized mouse model. Furthermore, overexpressing H1 calponin partially alleviated the inhibition caused by JZL184 or MAGL deletion on osteoclastogenesis. Therefore, we conclude that targeting MAGL may be a novel therapeutic strategy for osteoporosis.

AB Bone is a rigid yet dynamic organ, and this dynamism is mediated by the delicate balance between osteoclastic bone resorption and osteoblastic bone formation. However, excessive activation of osteoclasts is responsible for many bone diseases such as osteoporosis, Paget disease, and tumor bone metastasis. Agents that could inhibit osteoclast formation or function are regarded as promising alternatives to treat osteoclast related diseases. Recently, traditional Chinese medicine has attracted attention because of its multiple activities in bone metabolism. Among them, gastrodin has been reported as an anti osteoporosis agent that reduces reactive oxygen species. However, the direct action of gastrodin on osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption, and its underlying molecular mechanism, remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of gastrodin on receptor activator NF kappa B ligand (RANKL) activated osteoclasts formation and bone resorption. Our results showed that gastrodin retarded RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation efficiently by downregulating transcriptional and translational expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells cl (NFATc1), a major factor in RANKL mediated osteoclastogenesis. Meanwhile, gastrodin prevented osteoclast maturation and migration by inhibiting the gene expression of dendrocyte expressed seven transmembrane protein (DC STAMP), an osteoclastic specific gene that controls cells fusion and movement. And gastrodin prevented RANKL induced osteoclastic bone erosion in vitro. In addition, gastrodin also stimulated bone mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) spreading and osseointegration in titanium plate. In summary, gastrodin could prevent osteoclasts formation and bone resorption via blockage of NFATcl activity, and stimulate osseointegration in vitro. Gastrodin could be developed as a potent phytochemical candidate to treat osteolytic diseases. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objectives Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant bone tumour, and mainly affects adolescents and young adults. Although there has been substantial improvement in management of OS with surgery and chemotherapy, further survival increase has not been achieved over the past two decades.
   Methods We focused on the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) osteoclast (OCL) system as a biological target for OS. RANKL is a critical factor for OCL formation and bone resorption activity. The primary lesion in bone and ensuing metastasis in OS both require the induction of OCLs. RANK Fc is a potent RANKL antagonist and inhibitor of OCL formation and activity.
   Key findings In an orthotopic model in Balb/c nu/nu mice, a twice weekly dosing regimen of 350 mu g of RANK Fc per mouse subcutaneously (n = 5) reduced lung metastasis (P>0.05), preserved bone structure and reduced tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)(+) OCLs (P<0.005) in OS bearing bone. In vitro, RANK Fc suppressed OCL formation (P<0.005), bone resorption activity (P<0.005) and RANKL induced antiapoptosis (P<0.5) of OCLs.

AB The current design scheme on anti cancer materials is mainly through tuning the mechanical properties of the materials to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, with the involvement of Rho/ROCK signaling pathway. We hy pothesize that tuning the motility is another potential important approach to modifying the tumor microenvi ronment and inducing tumor apoptosis. To this aim, we have prepared RGD modified substrates to regulate cell motility through modification of RGD with different concentrations, and systematically examined the effect of motility on the apoptosis of tumor cells, and the potential involvement of Wnt signaling pathway. Our studies indicated that RGD modification could be readily used to tune the motility of cancer cells. High RGD concen tration significantly suppressed the migration of cancer cells, leading to significantly increased apoptosis rate, about three times of that of the unmodified samples. Western blot analysis also showed that cell with low motility expressed more caspase 3 and PARP proteins. Further RNA sequence study strongly suggested that low motility inhibited the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which in turn led to the activation of the mitochondria  associated caspase signaling pathway, and ultimately to the apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells. Activation of the Wnt beta catenin pathway through HLY78 significantly suppressed the apoptosis of MG 63 cells, further suggesting the critical role of Wnt pathway in motility regulated apoptosis of tumor cells. Our findings shed insights to understand the underlying mechanisms that induced the tumor cell apoptosis, and might provide new strategy for designing the novel anti tumor materials.

AB Lytic bone disease in myeloma is characterized by an increase in multinucleate osteoclasts in close proximity to tumor cells. However, the nature of osteoclast precursors and the mechanisms underlying multinuclearity are less understood. Here we show that culture of myeloma cell lines as well as primary myeloma cells with human dendritic cells (DCs) but not monocytes or macrophages leads to spontaneous cell cell fusion, which then leads to the facile formation of multinucleate bone resorbing giant cells. Osteoclastogenesis is cell contact dependent, leading to up regulation of thrombospondin 1 (TSP 1) in DCs. Disruption of CD47 TSP 1 interaction by TSP 1 blocking antibodies or down regulation of CD47 on tumor cells by RNA interference abrogates tumor induced osteoclast formation. Blockade of CD47 TSP 1 interactions also inhibits receptor activator for nuclear factor kappa B ligand and macrophage colony stimulating factor induced formation of osteoclasts from human monocytes. Further, TSP 1 blockade attenuates hypercalcemia induced by parathyroid hormone in vivo. These data point to a role for CD47 TSP 1 interactions in regulating cell fusion events involved in human osteoclast formation. They also suggest that DCs, known to be enriched in myeloma tumors, may be direct precursors for tumor associated osteoclasts. Disruption of CD47 TSP 1 interactions or preventing the recruitment of DCs to tumors may provide novel approaches to therapy of myeloma bone disease and osteoporosis. (Blood. 2009;114:3413 3421)

TI Efficacy, Mechanism, and Structure Activity Relationship of 6 Methoxy
   Benzofuran Derivatives as a Useful Tool for Senile Osteoporosis
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID SUBSTITUTED BENZOTHIOPHENE; UP REGULATORS; THERAPY; DENSITY
AB Most patients with senile osteoporosis (SOP) are severely deficient in bone mass, and treatments using bone resorption inhibitors, such as bisphosphonates, have shown limited efficacy. Small molecule osteogenesis promoting drugs are required to improve the treatment for this disease. Previously, we demonstrated that a compound with a benzofuran like structure promoted bone formation by upregulating BMP 2, and it exhibited a therapeutic effect in SAMP 6 mice, glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis rats, and ovariectomized rats. In this study, aged C57 and SAMP 6 mice models were used to investigate the therapeutic and preventive effects of compound 125 on SOP. scRNA seq analysis showed that BMP 2 upregulation is the mechanism through which 125 accelerates bone turnover and increases the proportion of osteoblasts. We evaluated the structure activity relationship of the candidate drugs and found that the derivative I 9 showed significantly higher efficacy than 125 and teriparatide in the zebrafish osteoporosis model. This study provides a foundation for the development of SOP drugs.

TI Low Level Laser Irradiation Stimulates RANKL Induced Osteoclastogenesis
   via the MAPK Pathway in RAW 264.7 Cells

AB Low level laser therapy (LLLT) is recognized as an effective medical tool for the treatment of various conditions requiring tissue repair, pain relief, inflammation treatment, and restoration of tissue dysfunction, and its development and research are growing rapidly. However, studies that analyze molecular biology by applying LLLT to osteoclasts are still insufficient to understand the mechanism. In order for LLLT to be suggested as an appropriate treatment method for the treatment of various bone diseases, it is necessary to elucidate the effect and mechanism of LLLT on osteoclast differentiation. In this study, we investigated the effect of LLLT on osteoclast differentiation using murine macrophage (RAW 264.7) cells by means of a Ga As Al laser (lambda = 810, 80 mW). Our results indicate that LLLT did not induce cytotoxicity in RAW 264.7 cells. When LLLT was applied for 15 s to osteoclasts exposed to RANKL, the expression of NF kappa B, ERK, p38, and c Fos, which are associated with expression of NFATc1, was increased. The RT PCR results also demonstrated significantly increased expression of osteoclast specific genes, including NFATc1, TRAP, the calcitonin receptor, and cathepsin K, compared with the control. Taken together, we concluded that low level laser irradiation induces osteoclastogenesis by enhancing the expression of NF kappa B, MAPKs (ERK, p38), c Fos, and NFATc1 in RAW 264.7 cells. These findings indicate that low level laser irradiation could be considered a potential treatment option in various metabolic bone diseases that require osteoclastic activity and bone formation.

AB Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the Major mediator of calcium homeostasis and bone remodeling and is now known to be an effective drug for osteoporosis treatment. Yet the mechanisms responsible for its functions in bone are largely unknown. Here we report that the expression of amphiregulin (AR), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, is rapidly and highly up regulated by PTH in several osteohlastic cell lines and bone tissues. Other osteotropic hormones (1alpha,25dihydroxyvitamin D 3 and prostaglandin E 2) also strongly stimulate AR expression. We found all EGF like ligands and their receptors are expressed in osteoblasts, but AR is the only member that is highly regulated by PTH. Functional studies demonstrated that although AR is a potent growth factor for preosteoblasts, it completely inhibits further differentiation. AR also strongly and quickly stimulated Akt and ERK phosphorylation and c fos and c jun expression in an EGF receptor dependent manner. Moreover, AR null mice displayed significantly less tibial trabecular bone than wild type mice. Taken together, we have identified a novel growth factor that is PTH regulated and appears to have an important role in bone metabolism.

AB Simple Summary Targeting receptor activator of nuclear factor & kappa;B ligand (RANKL) with the monoclonal antibody Denosumab decreases osteoclast mediated bone resorption and is approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Since RANKL is also implicated in mammary gland homeostasis and breast tumorigenesis, Denosumab is being currently pursued as a candidate for drug repurposing in oncology, including breast cancer, while its efficacy remains controversial. In this study, by developing a humanized transgenic mouse model of human RANKL overexpression, we demonstrated that RANKL mediated hormone induced mammary carcinogenesis, while its prophylactic inhibition by Denosumab prevented tumorigenesis. Our humanized transgenic mice provide a unique genetic tool for investigating the involvement of human RANKL in breast cancer pathogenesis and can serve as a preclinical platform for anticancer therapies. Receptor activator of nuclear factor & kappa;B ligand (RANKL) is critically involved in mammary gland pathophysiology, while its pharmaceutical inhibition is being currently investigated in breast cancer. Herein, we investigated whether the overexpression of human RANKL in transgenic mice affects hormone induced mammary carcinogenesis, and evaluated the efficacy of anti RANKL treatments, such as OPG Fc targeting both human and mouse RANKL or Denosumab against human RANKL. We established novel MPA/DMBA driven mammary carcinogenesis models in TgRANKL mice that express both human and mouse RANKL, as well as in humanized humTgRANKL mice expressing only human RANKL, and compared them to MPA/DMBA treated wild type (WT) mice. Our results show that TgRANKL and WT mice have similar levels of susceptibility to mammary carcinogenesis, while OPG Fc treatment restored mammary ductal density, and prevented ductal branching and the formation of neoplastic foci in both genotypes. humTgRANKL mice also developed MPA/DMBA induced tumors with similar incidence and burden to those of WT and TgRANKL mice. The prophylactic treatment of humTgRANKL mice with Denosumab significantly prevented the rate of appearance of mammary tumors from 86.7% to 15.4% and the early stages of carcinogenesis, whereas therapeutic treatment did not lead to any significant attenuation of tumor incidence or tumor burden compared to control mice, suggesting the importance of RANKL primarily in the initial stages of tumorigenesis. Overall, we provide unique genetic tools for investigating the involvement of RANKL in breast carcinogenesis, and allow the preclinical evaluation of novel therapeutics that target hormone related breast cancers.

TI Deficiency of optineurin enhances osteoclast differentiation by

AB Bone degeneration: Identifying a damage limiting protein The protein optineurin is implicated in regulating the breakdown of bone during natural maintenance by a mechanism that may be relevant to understanding and treating degenerative bone diseases. Cells called osteoclasts mediate bone breakdown during natural bone turnover, but excessive breakdown occurs in some bone diseases. Working with cultured mouse cells, researchers in the USA, led by Ching Chang Ko at Ohio State University, Columbus, and Henry Tseng at Duke University, identified a molecular signaling pathway in which optineurin interacts with a protein called NRF2, which is known as the master regulator of the antioxidant response. This interaction allows optineurin to limit the production of chemicals called reactive oxidative species which stimulate osteoclast generation. The findings suggest that drugs regulating the optineurin signaling pathway may help treat bone degeneration and possibly other degenerative diseases.
   Abnormally increased resorption contributes to bone degenerative diseases such as Paget's disease of bone (PDB) through unclear mechanisms. Recently, the optineurin (OPTN) gene has been implicated in PDB, and global OPTN knockout mice (Optn( / )) were shown to exhibit increased formation of osteoclasts (osteoclastogenesis). Growing evidence, including our own, has demonstrated that intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) stimulated by receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) can act as signaling molecules to promote osteoclastogenesis. Here, we report that OPTN interacts with nuclear factor erythroid derived factor 2 related factor 2 (NRF2), the master regulator of the antioxidant response, defining a pathway through which RANKL induced ROS could be regulated for osteoclastogenesis. In this study, monocytes from Optn( / ) and wild type (Optn(+/+)) mice were utilized to differentiate into osteoclasts, and both qRT PCR and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining showed that the Optn( / ) monocytes exhibited enhanced osteoclastogenesis compared to the Optn(+/+) cells. CellROX staining, qRT PCR, and Western blotting indicated that OPTN deficiency reduced the basal expression of Nrf2, inhibited the expression of NRF2 responsive antioxidants, and increased basal and RANKL induced intracellular ROS levels, leading to enhanced osteoclastogenesis. Coimmunoprecipitation (co IP) showed direct interaction, and immunofluorescence staining showed perinuclear colocalization of the OPTN NRF2 granular structures during differentiation. Finally, curcumin and the other NRF2 activators attenuated the hyperactive osteoclastogenesis induced by OPTN deficiency. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel OPTN mediated mechanism for regulating the NRF2 mediated antioxidant response in osteoclasts and extend the therapeutic potential of OPTN in the aging process resulting from ROS triggered oxidative stress, which is associated with PDB and many other degenerative diseases.

TI Inhibitory Effect of Purpurogallin on Osteoclast Differentiation In

AB Purpurogallin, a benzotropolone containing natural compound, has been reported to exhibit numerous biological and pharmacological functions, such as antioxidant, anticancer, and anti inflammatory effects. In this study, we enzymatically synthesized purpurogallin from pyrogallol and investigated its role in receptor activator of nuclear factor B ligand (RANKL) induced osteoclastogenesis. Purpurogallin attenuated the formation of multinucleated tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) positive osteoclasts from bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) without causing cytotoxicity, and suppressed upregulation of osteoclast specific markers, including TRAP (Acp5), cathepsin K (Ctsk), and dendritic cell specific transmembrane protein (Dcstamp). However, purpurogallin did not affect the bone resorbing function of mature osteoclasts evident by the resorption pit assay. Activation of mitogen activated protein kinases, Akt and IkB pathways in RANK signaling were not altered by purpurogallin, whereas the expression of c Fos and NFATc1, key transcriptional regulators in osteoclastogenesis, was dramatically inhibited by purpurogallin. Purpurogallin also significantly reduced the expression level of B lymphocyte induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp1) gene (Prdm1). Further, downregulation of Blimp1 led to forced expression of anti osteoclastogenic genes, including interferon regulatory factor 8 (Irf8) and B cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl6) genes. Taken together, our data suggested that purpurogallin inhibits osteoclast differentiation via downregulation of c Fos and NFATc1.

AB Bisphosphonates are analogues of the natural compound pyrophosphate and one consequence of the mechanism of action of bisphosphonates on bone metabolism is the reduction of bone turnover, replenish the resorption spaces and to mineralize the extracellular matrix. Osteonecrosis of the jaw is the most common side effect of bisphosphonates and most often occurs after an invasive dental procedure, such as dental extraction. The existence of a maxillary bone infection leads to a delayed healing reaction manifested by the presence of areas necrotic bone, exposed in the oral cavity, which persists for more than eight weeks and has no tendency to heal. In most cases, the dentist is the first one who can detect the onset of osteonecrosis even in the early stages, thus being able to direct the patient to a hospital unit where he/she receives the treatment of necessity. The aim of this retrospective study is to determine the link between bisphosphonate therapy and the occurrence of necrosis of maxillary and mandibular bone. This study was conducted on 22 patients hospitalized for different stages of bone necrosis for a period of two years. The prevalence of osteonecrosis is higher in menopausal women and also after a certain period after the bisphosphonate therapy is closed.

AB Cell stemness is characterized by quiescence, pluripotency, and long term self renewal capacity. Therapy resistant leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are the primary cause of relapse in patients with chronic and acute myeloid leukemia (CML and AML). However, the same signaling pathways frequently support stemness in both LSCs and normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), making LSCs difficult to therapeutically target. In cell lines and patient samples, we found that interleukin 33 (IL 33) signaling promoted stemness only in leukemia cells in a subtype specific manner. The IL 33 receptor ST2 was abundant on the surfaces of CD34(+) BCR/ABL1 CML and CD34(+) AML cells harboring AML1/ETO and DEK/NUP214 translocations or deletion of chromosome 9q [del(9q)]. The cell surface abundance of ST2, which was lower or absent on other leukemia subtypes and HSCs, correlated with stemness, activated Wnt signaling, and repressed Notch signaling. IL 33 ST2 signaling promoted the maintenance and expansion of AML1/ETO , DEK/NUP214 , and BCR/ABL1 positive LSCs in culture and in mice by activating Wnt, MAPK, and NF kappa B signaling. Wnt signaling and its inhibition of the Notch pathway up regulated the expression of the gene encoding ST2, thus forming a cell autonomous loop. IL 33 ST2 signaling promoted the resistance of CML cells to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) nilotinib and of AML cells to standard chemotherapy. Thus, inhibiting IL 33 ST2 signaling may target LSCs to overcome resistance to chemotherapy or TKIs in these subtypes of leukemia.

AB Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling has been implicated in several processes during embryonic development and in adult tissue homeostasis. Maintenance of many organs such as skin, intestinal villi, bones and bone marrow requires continuous regeneration and subsequent differentiation of stem cells in order to maintain organ shape and size necessary for proper functioning. Although BMPs were initially identified as osteogenic factors present in demineralized bone capable of inducing ectopic bone formation, it is now evident that BMPs perform several other functions during embryonic development as well as during the adult life of an organism. Many disorders have been linked to either the BMPs or the molecules functioning downstream of BMP signaling pathway. This review summarizes the existing literature describing the role of BMP signaling during embryonic development and in adult tissue homeostasis to provide a perspective on pharmacological interventions of BMP signaling pathway to mitigate several disease conditions.

TI Saikosaponin A attenuates osteoclastogenesis and bone loss by inducing

AB To alleviate bone loss, most current drugs target osteoclasts. Saikosaponin A (Ssa), a triterpene saponin derived from Bupleurum falcatum (also known as Radix bupleuri), has immunoregulatory, neuromodulatory, antiviral, anticancer, anti convulsant, anti inflammatory, and anti proliferative effects. Recently, modulation of bone homeostasis was shown to involve ferroptosis. Herein, we aimed to determine Ssa's inhibitory effects on osteoclastogenesis and differentiation, whether ferroptosis is involved, and the underlying mechanisms. Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, F actin staining, and pit formation assays were conducted to confirm Ssa mediated inhibition of RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Ssa could promote osteoclast ferroptosis and increase mitochondrial damage by promoting lipid peroxidation, as measured by iron quantification, FerroOrange staining, Dichloro dihydro fluorescein diacetate, MitoSOX, malondialdehyde, glutathione, and boron dipyrromethene 581/591 C11 assays. Pathway analysis showed that Ssa can promote osteoclasts ferroptosis by inhibiting the Nrf2/SCL7A11/GPX4 axis. Notably, we found that the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin 1 and the Nrf2 activator tert Butylhydroquinone reversed the inhibitory effects of Ssa on RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis. In vivo, micro computed tomography, hematoxylin and eosin staining, TRAP staining, enzyme linked immunosorbent assays, and immunofluorescence confirmed that in rats with periodontitis induced by lipopolysaccharide, treatment with Ssa reduced alveolar bone resorption dose dependently. The results suggested Ssa as a promising drug to treat osteolytic diseases.

AB Objectives: Vascular calcification is a major clinical problem and elucidating the underlying mechanism is important to improve the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular disease. We aimed to elucidate the role and mechanism of action of Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF)/c Met signalling in vascular calcification and establish whether blocking this pathway could prevent mineralisation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vitro.
   Methods and results: We demonstrate increased HGF secretion and c Met up regulation and phosphorylation during VSMC osteogenic differentiation. Adenoviral mediated over expression of HGF (AdHGF) in VSMCs accelerated mineralisation, shown by alizarin red staining, and significantly increased (45)Calcium incorporation (1.96 +/  0.54 fold [P < 0.05]) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (3.01 +/  0.8 fold [P < 0.05]) compared to controls. AdHGF also significantly elevated mRNA expression of bone related proteins, Runx2, osteocalcin, BMP2 and osterix in VSMCs. AdHGF accelerated mineralisation correlated with increased Akt phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of Notch3 intracellular domain (N3IC) and up regulation of the Notch3 target protein, HES1. In contrast, adenoviral mediated over expression of the HGF antagonist, NK4, markedly attenuated VSMC mineralisation, and reduced c Met phosphorylation, Akt activation and HES1 protein expression compared to AdHGF treated cells. Furthermore, the Notch inhibitor, DAPT, attenuated N3IC nuclear translocation and AdHGF induced mineralisation.
   Conclusion: We demonstrate HGF induces VSMC osteogenic differentiation via c Met/Akt/Notch3 signalling, highlighting these pathways as potential targets for intervention of vascular calcification. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bisphosphonates have the potential to reduce osteolysis, a phenomenon that has been postulated to play a key role in aseptic loosening of total joint replacements. Bisphosphonates may contribute to the in vivo longevity of total joint replacements. Some authors have suggested there are decreases in flexural strength and flexural modulus of the cured cement when a liquid form of disodium pamidronate is added to a commercially available acrylic bone cement (Palacos R). We proposed that it is comparatively easier to blend a bisphosphonate in powder form into an acrylic bone cement than it is when the drug is in liquid form; and that the cement's fatigue life is decreased when the bisphosphonate is added in liquid rather than in solid form. The bisphosphonate and bone cement used were alendronate sodium and Cemex(R) XL, respectively. The fatigue tests were done using phosphate buffered saline solution at 37 degrees +/  1 degrees C. The data supported both hypotheses. Our findings should guide orthopaedic surgeons when using bisphosphonate impregnated acrylic bone cements in total joint replacements. Bisphosphonates are endogenous pyrophosphate analogs in which a carbon atom replaces the central oxygen atom. These therapeutic agents may be classified into nitrogen and non nitrogen containing types. Some examples are alendronate, pamidronate, ibandronate, risedronate, etidronate, clodronate, and zoledronate. There are many targets and mechanisms of action of this family of drugs, therefore making them efficacious against diverse clinical conditions such asosteoporosis,(8) periprosthetic bone loss subsequent to total joint replacement,(3,17,29) tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis,2fi Charcot neuroarthropathy,(2) rheumatoid arthritis,(4) ankylosing spondylitis and spondyloarthropathies,(27) and arterial calcification.(25) It has been proposed that some bisphosphonates are effective against the mechanisms that have been suggested as being implicated in aseptic loosening of total joint replacements, these being osteoclast mediated bone resorption and wear particle induced osteolysis.(22) A meta analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that alendronate and pamidronate had beneficial effects maintaining periprosthetic bone for as much as 1 year after a total joint replacement.(3).

AB Chinese herbal medicine Fructus Cnidii has an outstanding effect on chronic lumbar pain and impotence, also has been used against osteoporosis with high frequency. Yet, the mechanisms of osthole, a derivative of Fructus Cnidii, on osteoclasts remains barely known. In this study, it was found out that osthole (10( 6)mol/L, 10( 5)mol/L) had the influence of inhibiting osteoclast formation and bone resorptive activities induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), rather than affecting the viability of osteoclast like cells. Furthermore, osthole could also inhibit the messenger RNA expressions of c Src, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase, beta 3 Integrin, matrix metallopeptidase 9, and cathepsin K. The results of the mechanistic study indicated that osthole regulated the nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) activations following the RANKL stimulation. These findings suggested that the inhibitory effects of osthole were associated with restraining the activations of NFATc1 and NF kappa B induced by RANKL. Thus osthole can be used as a potential treatment for abnormal bone resorption related diseases.

AB Aseptic loosening of total joint replacements is caused by wear debris induced osteoclastic bone resorption, for which bisphosphonates (Bps) and RANK antagonists have been developed. Although BPs are effective in preventing metabolic bone loss, they are less effective for inflammatory bone loss. Because this difference has been attributed to the antiapoptotic inflammatory signals that protect osteoclasts from BP induced apoptosis, but not RANK antagonists, we tested the hypothesis that osteoprotegerin (OPG) is more effective in preventing wear debris induced osteolysis than zoledronic acid (ZA) or alendronate (Aln) in the murine calvaria model using in vivo micro CT and traditional histology. Although micro CT proved to be incompatible with titanium (Ti) particles, we were able to demonstrate a 3.2 fold increase in osteolytic volume over 10 days induced by polyethylene (PE) particles versus sham controls (0.49 +/  0.23mm(3) versus 0.15 +/  0.067mm(3); p < 0.01). Although OPG and high dose ZA completely inhibited this PE induced osteolysis (p < 0.001), pharmacological doses of ZA and Aln were less effective but still reached statistical significance (p < 0.05). Traditional histomorphometry of the sagital suture area of calvaria from both Ti and PE treated mice confirmed the remarkable suppression of resorption by OPG (p < 0.001) versus the lack of effect by physiological Bps. The differences in drug effects on osteolysis were largely explained by the significant difference in osteoclast numbers observed between OPG versus BPs in both Ti  and PE treated calvaria; and linear regression analyses that demonstrated a highly significant correlation between osteolysis volume and sagittal suture area versus osteoclast numbers (p < 0.001).

AB Pharmaceutical treatments can slow bone degradation, thus reducing the fracture risk inherent in osteoporosis. Antiresorptive treatments block the over activation of osteoclasts vs osteoblasts, but the resulting decrease in bone remodeling frequency may weaken bone structure over time, with no gain in bone volume. Anabolic treatments, however, induce gain in bone volume. The quantitative results from existing studies on the effects of treatments over time are general and non patient specific, while numerical models simulating evolution of patient specific bone microarchitecture consider a spatially random distribution of the remodeling process. Here, we propose a new approach to simulate the remodeling over decades of an individual patient's bone microarchitecture, based on the hypothesis that the oldest sites, which are hypermineralized and more brittle, are remodeled first. Taking these older sites as prime targets of remodeling, simulations show that severe osteoporosis profoundly degrades the mechanical properties of the bone structure, which can be restored and even improved by anabolic, more than by antiresorptive, therapies.

AB Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been identified to accelerate bone formation. However, detailed mechanism has not been fully explained. In this study, we found that ESWT promoted osteoblast formation in vitro. Local ESW treatment of femur increased bone formation in vivo. Furthermore, changing the density or frequency of energy, there was no statistical difference in osteogenic differentiation. Therapeutically, local ESW therapy relieved bone loss and increased the number of bone trabecular in a rabbit osteoporosis model and promoted endogenous levels of SMAD2 protein expression. Thus, ESWT may be a potential therapy by promoting osteoblast maturation through TGF beta/SMAD2 pathway.

AB Inflammation induced bone erosion is a major pathological factor in several chronic inflammatory diseases that often cause severe outcomes, such as rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis. Plenty of evidences indicated that the inflammatory bone destruction was attributed to an increase in the number of bone resorbing osteoclasts. However, anti resorptive therapy alone failed to prevent bone loss in an inflammatory condition. Conventional anti inflammation treatments are usually intended to suppress inflammation only, but ignore debilitating the subsequent bone destruction. Therefore, inhibition of proinflammatory activation of osteoclastogenesis could be an important strategy for the development of drugs aimed at preventing inflammatory bone destruction.
   Methods: In this study, we synthesized a peptide coated gold cluster to evaluate its effects on inflammatory osteoclastogenesis in vitro and inflammation induced bone destruction in vivo. The in vitro anti inflammation and anti osteoclastogenesis effects of the cluster were evaluated in LPS stimulated and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) stimulated macrophages, respectively. The LPS induced expression of crucial pro inflammation cytokines and RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis as well as the activation of NF kappa B pathway in both situations were detected. The inflammation induced RANKL expression and subsequent inflammatory bone destruction in vivo were determined in collagen immunized mice.
   Results: The gold cluster strongly suppresses RANKL induced osteoclast formation via inhibiting the activation of NF kappa B pathway in vitro. Moreover, treatment with the clusters at a dose of 5 mg Au/kg. bw significantly reduces the severity of inflammation induced bone and cartilage destruction in vivo without any significant toxicity effects.
   Conclusion: Therefore, the gold clusters may offer a novel potent therapeutic stratagem for inhibiting chronic inflammation associated bone destruction.

AB The coupling of bone formation to bone resorption during treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis with antiresorbers might be related to changes in Wnt/b catenin signaling. We compared the effects of two bisphosphonate treatments on two Wnt inhibitors Sclerostin (SOST) and Dickkopf related protein, I (DKK1). The study population included 74 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis participating simultaneously in two multicenter, placebo controlled trials. The patients were randomized to: intramuscular clodronate 100 mg/week (CLO) (N = 36), and yearly intravenous therapy with 5 mg zoledronate (ZOL) (N = 18) and placebo (N = 20).
   Bone turnover markers (intact N propeptide of type I collagen [P1NP], C terminal telopeptide of type I collagen [CTX]) remained unchanged in the placebo group while they significantly decreased during treatment with the two bisphosphonates, versus both placebo and baseline. In CLO treated patients serum DIM remained stable over the entire period of observation while serum SOST levels increased significantly after 12 months of treatment both versus placebo group (p < 0,005), baseline (p < 0,001) and ZOL treated group.
   In the ZOL group, DKK1 levels increased significantly within one month and for the following 6 months and it fell back to baseline values at 12 months. The second ZOL infusion was again associated with an increase in DKK1 a month later, although to a lesser extent.
   In conclusion, in this study we have found that the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis with intermittent yearly ZOL is associated with transient and declining increases in DKK1 while continuous treatment with CLO, results in a late increase in serum SOST. These preliminary results and further ad hoc studies might contribute to shed light on our understanding of the bone coupling effects taking place during treatment of osteoporosis with different anti resorbers or with different treatment regimens.

AB Human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) have become an important component for bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to their ability to differentiate into osteoblast precursors. Two miRNA chip datasets (GSE138180 and E MTAB 3077) of DPSCs osteogenic differentiation were analyzed respectively to find the expression of miR 483 3p significantly increased in the differentiated groups. We further confirmed that miR 483 3p continued to overexpress during osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs, especially reaching its peak on the 7th day. Moreover, miR 483 3p could significantly promote the expression of osteogenic markers including RUNX2 and OSX, and activate MAPK signaling pathway by inducing phosphorylation of ERK, p38, and JNK. In addition, as a significant gene within the MAPK signaling pathway, ARRB2 was identified as the target gene of miR 483 3p by bioinformatic prediction and experimental verification. In conclusion, we identified miR 483 3p could promote osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs via the MAPK signaling pathway by targeting ARRB2.

AB Osteoporosis is a disease with a worldwide prevalence that involves a severe loss of bone mineral density and decreased microarchitecture, which increases the risk of bone fracture. The present study evaluated the effects of isopsoralen on osteoblastic OB 6 cells following hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced damage and investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in this process. For in vitro experiments, OB 6 osteoblasts were treated with H2O2 or H2O2 + isopsoralen then the cell viability, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and calcium accumulation were determined. Results demonstrated that treatment with H2O2 reduced cell viability, runt related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and osteocalcin (OCN) expression levels, and calcium deposition, whilst markedly increasing cell apoptosis and ROS production. However, isopsoralen (1 mu M) provided significant protection against H2O2 induced alterations in osteoblasts. In addition, isopsoralen effectively upregulated protein expression of tankyrase and beta catenin which are the main transductors of the Wnt/beta catenin pathway. Of note, the protective effects of isopsoralen against H2O2 induced damage were attenuated in OB 6 cells treated with tankyrase inhibitor XAV 939. In conclusion, the present findings provided evidence that isopsoralen attenuated oxidative stress induced injury in osteoblasts via the Wnt/beta catenin signaling pathway.

AB Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder defined by a decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and an increased susceptibility to fractures. Bisphosphonates and selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERM) are among the most widely used drugs. They inhibit bone resorption by targeting the mevalonate and oestrogen pathways, respectively. The aim of this study was to determine if common variants of genes in those pathways influence drug responses. We studied 192 women treated with oral aminobisphosphonates and 51 with SERMs. Genotypes at 154 SNPs of the mevalonate pathway and 806 in the oestrogen pathway were analyzed. Several SNPs located in genes FDPS and FNTA were associated with the bisphosphonate induced changes in hip bone mineral density (BMD), whereas polymorphisms of the PDSS1, CYP19A1, CYP1A1, and CYP1A2 genes were associated with SERM induced changes in spine BMD. After multivariate analyses, genotypes combining genes FDPS and FNTA showed a stronger association with bisphosphonate response (r = 0.34; p = 0.00009), whereas the combination of CYP19A1 and PDSS1 genotypes was associated with the response to SERMs (r = 0.62, p = 0.0003). These results suggest that genotyping genes in these pathways may help predict the response to antiresorptive drugs and hence make personalized therapeutic choices.

AB The Notch signaling pathway is important for cell fate decisions in embryonic development and adult life. Defining the functional importance of the Notch pathway in these contexts requires the elucidation of essential signal transduction components that have not been fully characterized. Here, we show that Rabconnectin 3B is required for the Notch pathway in mammalian cells. siRNA mediated silencing of Rabconnectin 3B in mammalian cells attenuated Notch signaling and disrupted the activation and nuclear accumulation of the Notch target Hes1. Rabconnectin 3B knockdown also disrupted V ATPase activity in mammalian cells, consistent with previous observations in Drosophila. Pharmacological inhibition of the V ATPase complex significantly reduced Notch signaling in mammalian cells. Finally, Rabconnectin 3B knockdown phenocopied functional disruption of Notch signaling during osteoclast differentiation. Collectively, these findings define an important role for Rabconnectin 3 and V ATPase activity in the Notch signaling pathway in mammalian cells.

AB Background. This position paper addresses the prevention of bisphosphonate associated osteonecrosis (BON) and the management of care of patients with cancer and/or osteoporosis who are receiving bisphosphonates and who have BON or are at the rsk of developing it.
   Methods. The authors reviewed the literature available on this newly described oral complication. Information of interest included bisphosphonates, the medications associated with this oral complication; the patient population at risk of developing BON and the diseases being treated with this class of medications; the clinical presentation of the oral lessons; guidelines for managing the care of patients who develop BON; the prevention of this complication based on current knowledge; and recommendations for routine dental treatment of patients receiving bisphosphonates.
   Results. There is strong evidence that bisphosphonate therapy is the common link in patients with BON. The pathobiological mechanism leading to BON may have to do with the inhibition of bone remodeling and decreased intraosseous blood flow caused by bisphosphonates. People at risk include patients with multiple myeloma and patients with cancer metastatic to bone who are receiving intravenous bisphosphonates, as well as patients taking bisphosphonates for osteoporosis. The risk of developing complications appears to increase with time of use of the medication. There are no guidelines based on evidence, and the clinical management of the oral complication is based on expert opinion.
   Conclusions. Prevention of BON is the best approach to management of this complication. Existing protocols to manage the care of patients who will receive radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be used until specific guidelines for BON are developed.

AB The adult bone is continuously being remodelled to repair microdamage, preserve bone strength and mechanical competence as well as maintain calcium homeostasis. Bone turnover markers are products of osteoblasts (bone formation markers) and osteoclasts (bone resorption markers) providing a dynamic assessment of remodelling (turnover). Resorption specific bone turnover markers are typically degradation products of bone collagen molecules (N  [NTX] and C telopeptide cross linked type 1 collagen [CTX]), which are released into the circulation and excreted in urine; or enzymatic activities reflecting osteoclastic resorption, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase [TRACP]. Formation specific bone turnover markers embrace different osteoblastic activities: type 1 collagen synthesis (Procollagen type I N  propeptide [PINP]), osteoblast enzymes (bone specific alkaline phosphatase [BALP]), or bone matrix proteins [osteocalcin]. Among individuals not receiving osteoporosis treatment, resorption and formation markers are tightly linked and highly correlated (r = 0.6 0.8).
   Significant biological variability was reported in the past, but these issues have been greatly improved with automated assays and attention to pre analytical and analytical factors that are known to influence bone turnover marker levels. Bone turnover markers are not useful in the diagnosis of osteoporosis, the individual prediction of bone loss, fracture, or rare complications, or in the selection of pharmacological treatment. Despite remaining issues with reference intervals and assays harmonization, bone turnover markers have proven to be useful in elucidating the pharmacodynamics and effectiveness of osteoporosis medications in clinical trials. As an alternative to BMD testing, BTMs may be useful to monitor osteoporosis therapies.

AB Steroid induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH) is a refractory disease induced by glucocorticoids. Marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) differentiate into multiple bone matrix cells and have been used as cell based therapies to treat ONFH. However, the osteogenesis of MSCs isolated from patients with SONFH is significantly decreased. Polydatin has been widely used in traditional Chinese remedies due to its multiple pharmacological actions. As shown in our previous study, Polydatin protects from oxidative stress and promotes BMSC migration. However, little is known about its role in BMSC (Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells) osteogenesis; therefore, we further investigated the effect and mechanism of Polydatin in hBMSC osteogenesis. The ability of Polydatin to promote the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs was determined using the MTT assay, ALP staining and the ALP activity assay. Next, qPCR and western blotting were performed to measure the levels of genes and proteins related to the osteogenesis of hBMSCs. Then, the effect of Polydatin on the nuclear translocation of beta catenin was determined using immunofluorescence staining. Polydatin (30 mu M) markedly enhanced the proliferation of hBMSCs and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Additionally, it also significantly upregulated the expression of osteogenic genes (Runx2, osteopontin, DLX5, osteocalcin, collagen type I and BMP2) and components of the Wnt signaling pathway (beta catenin, Lef1, TCF7, c jun, c myc and cyclin D). These osteogenesis potentiating effects of Polydatin were blocked by Noggin, an inhibitor of the BMP pathway, and DKK1, an inhibitor of the Wnt/beta catenin pathway. However, DKK1 did not affect Polydatin induced BMP2 expression. Based on our results, Polydatin promotes the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs through the BMP2 Wnt/beta catenin signaling pathway.

AB Limited treatment options exist for cancer within the bone, as demonstrated by the inevitable, pernicious course of metastatic and blood cancers. The difficulty of eliminating bone residing cancer, especially drug resistant cancer, necessitates novel, alternative treatments to manipulate tumor cells and their microenvironment, with minimal off target effects. To this end, bone targeted conjugate (BP Btz) was generated by linking bortezomib (Btz, an anticancer, bone stimulatory drug) to a bisphosphonate (BP, a targeting ligand) through a cleavable linker that enables spatiotemporally controlled delivery of Btz to bone under acidic conditions for treating multiple myeloma (MM). Three conjugates with different linkers were developed and screened for best efficacy in mouse model of MM. Results demonstrated that the lead candidate BP Btz with optimal linker could overcome Btz resistance, reduced tumor burden, bone destruction, or tumor metastasis more effectively than BP or free Btz without thrombocytopenia and neurotoxicity in mice bearing myeloma. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies showed that BP Btz bound to bone matrix, released Btz in acidic conditions, and had a higher local concentration and longer half life than Btz in bone. Our findings suggest the potential of bone targeted Btz conjugate as an efficacious Btz resistant MM treatment mechanism. (c) 2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).

AB Glucocorticoid therapy, especially at higher doses, is associated with significant adverse side effects including osteoporosis. Leptin, secreted from adipose tissue, has diverse effects on bone tissue regulation. As glucocorticoids stimulate leptin synthesis and secretion directly in adipose tissue we hypothesised that dexamethasone (DEX) induced osteoporosis may, in part, be mediated by an osteoblast dependent leptin leptin receptor pathway. Human bone cells expressed leptin and leptin receptors (Ob Ra and Ob Rb). DEX increased leptin, Ob Ra and Ob Rb expression in a dose dependent manner while decreasing expression of osteocalcin. In the presence of leptin, Cbfa1 and osteonectin expression showed no significant change, whereas osteocalcin expression was decreased. Recombinant human quadruple antagonist leptin suppressed DEX induced osteocalcin downregulation. The signaling pathway involved up regulation of JAK2. In conclusion, upregulation of leptin and Ob Rb in human bone cells by DEX is associated with down regulation of osteocalcin expression. The down regulation of osteocalcin by DEX was partially through a leptin autocrine/paracrine loop. Adverse effects of DEX on the skeleton may be modified by targeting leptin signaling pathways.

AB Background: Statins, especially simvastatin promote bone formation by stimulating the activity of osteoblasts and suppressing osteoclast activity via the BMP Smad signaling pathway. Statins present the liver first pass metabolism. This study attempts to fabricate and evaluate simvastatin functionalized hydroxyapatite encapsulated in poly(lactic co glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles (HSIM PLGA NPs) administered subcutaneously with sustained release properties for effective management of osteoporosis.Methods: Simvastatin functionalized hydroxyapatite (HSIM) was prepared by stirring and validated by docking studies, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X ray diffraction (XRD). Further, HSIM loaded PLGA nanoparticles (HSIM PLGA NPs) were developed via the solvent emulsification method. The nanoparticles were evaluated for zeta potential, particle size, entrapment efficiency, stability studies, and in vitro drug release studies. in vitro binding affinity of nanoparticles for hydroxyapatite was also measured. Bone morphology and its effect on bone mineral density were examined by using a glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis rat model.Results: The optimized nanoparticles were found to be amorphous and showed no drug polymer in teraction. The particle size of formulated nanoparticles varied from 196.8 +/  2.27nm to 524.8 +/  5.49nm and the entrapment efficiency of nanoparticles varied from 41.9 +/  3.44% to 70.8 +/  4.46%, re spectively. The nanoparticles showed sustained release behaviour (75% in 24 hr) of the drug fol lowed by non fickian drug release. The nanoparticles exhibited high binding affinity to bone cell re ceptors, increasing bone mineral density. A significant difference in calcium and phosphorous lev els was observed in disease and treatment rats. Porous bone and significant improvement in porosity were observed in osteoporotic rats and treated rats, respectively (p < 0.05).Conclusion: Bone targeting nanoparticles incorporating functionalized simvastatin can target bone. Thus, in order to distribute simvastatin subcutaneously for the treatment of osteoporosis, the developed nanoparticles may act as a promising approach.

AB Osteoporosis is a widespread bone disease that affects million cases annually. The underlying mechanisms behind the progress of osteoporosis remain enigmatic, which limits detections of biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Hence, this study was aimed at exploring hub molecules to better understand the mechanism of osteoporosis development and discover the traditional Chinese medicine potential drugs for osteoporosis. miRNA and gene expression profiles were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify the key modules for osteoporosis. DIANA Tools was applied to perform pathway enrichment. A miRNA gene interaction network was constructed, and hub miRNAs and genes were distinguished using Cytoscape software. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of hub miRNAs and genes were plotted, and correlations with hub genes and osteoporosis associated factors were evaluated. Potential drugs for osteoporosis in Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) were screened, and molecular docking models between these drugs and target genes were showed by AutoDock tools. Two hub modules, 1 miRNA module and 1 gene module, were identified to be the most strongly correlated with osteoporosis by using WGCNA. Then, 3 KEGG pathways including focal adhesion, PI3K Akt signaling pathway, and gap junction were shared pathways enriched with the miRNAs and genes screened out by WGCNA and differential expression analyses. Finally, after constructing a miRNA gene interaction network, 6 hub miRNAs (hsa miR 18b 3p, hsa miR 361 3p, hsa miR 484, hsa miR 519e 5p, hsa miR 940, and hsa miR 1275) and 6 hub genes (THBS1, IFNAR2, ARHGAP5, TUBB2B, FLNC, and NTF3) were detected. ROC curves showed good performances of miRNAs and genes for osteoporosis. Correlations with hub genes and osteoporosis associated factors suggested implicational roles of them for osteoporosis. Based on these hub genes, 3 natural compounds (kainic acid, uridine, and quercetin), which were the active ingredients of 192 herbs, were screened out, and a target compound herb network was extracted using TCMSP. Molecular docking models of kainic acid NTF3, uridine IFNAR2, and quercetin THBS1 were exhibited with AutoDock tools. Our study sheds light on the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and provides promising therapeutic targets and traditional Chinese medicine drugs for osteoporosis.

AB Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has limited efficacy against leukemia stem cells (LSC) responsible for disease propagation, and most CML patients require continued TKI treatment to maintain remission. LSC maintenance is related, at least in part, to signals from the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM). Our previous studies have shown that Wnt signaling from the BMM contributes to preservation of CML LSC following TKI treatment. Secretion of Wnt ligands requires their modification by the O acyl transferase Porcupine (PORCN). Here we investigated the activity of a potent and selective PORCN inhibitor, WNT974, against CML stem and progenitor cells. WNT974 efficiently antagonized Wnt signaling in human CML CD34(+) cells, and in combination with the TKI nilotinib (NIL) significantly enhanced inhibition of proliferation and colony forming potential of CML stem and progenitor cells and reduced their growth in immunodeficient mice in vivo, in comparison with NIL alone. Treatment of transgenic CML mice in vivo with NIL in combination with WNT974 significantly reduced leukemic stem and progenitor cell numbers, reduced regeneration of leukemic long term hematopoietic stem cells in secondary transplant recipients, and enhanced survival of mice after discontinuation of treatment, in comparison with NIL alone. CMLprogenitors demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to Wnt stimulation, associated with increased expression of the FZD4 receptor. FZD4 knockdown inhibited CML progenitor growth. These results support further investigation of PORCN targeting to inhibit Wnt secretion and signaling and enhance targeting of CML stem cells while sparing their normal counterparts.

AB Butein is a phytochemical that belongs to the chalcone family of flavonoids and has antitumor, anti inflammatory, and anti osteoclastic bone resorption activities. This study aims to investigate the effects of butein on the differentiation potential of mouse primary bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (mBMSCs) into osteoblast and adipocyte lineages. Primary cultures of mBMSCs are treated with different doses of butein during its differentiation. Osteoblast differentiation is assessed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity quantification and Alizarin red staining for matrix mineralization, while adipogenesis is assessed by quantification of lipid accumulation using Oil Red O staining. Osteoblastic and adipocytic gene expression markers are determined by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). Western blot analysis is used to study the activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2). Interestingly, butein promotes the lineage commitment of mBMSCs into osteoblasts, while suppressing their differentiation into adipocytes in a dose dependent manner. A similar effect of butein is confirmed in human (h) primary BMSCs. Occurring at the molecular level, butein significantly upregulates the mRNA expression of osteoblast related genes, while downregulating the expression of adipocyte related genes. The mechanism of butein induced osteogenesis is found to be mediated by activating the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. To conclude, we identify butein as a novel nutraceutical compound with an osteo anabolic activity to promote the lineage commitment of BMSCs into osteoblast versus adipocyte. Thus, butein can be a plausible therapeutic drug for enhancing bone formation in osteoporotic patients.

AB Bone metastasis is the major cause of cancer related morbidity and mortality. To avoid further osteolysis, current treatment ideas focus on tumor cell and the inhibition of osteoclast. Herein, zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 capped Cu2 XSe composite nanoplatform (ICG@Cu2 XSe ZIF 8) is developed for chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) treatment of malignant breast cancer bone tumors. The rational design of ZIF 8 encapsulation greatly reduces the accumulation of Cu2 XSe to damage the normal cells. Under acidic microenvironment in tumor, ZIF 8 is cleaved to release Cu2 XSe, which can subsequently degrade into Cu (+) and Cu (2+) ions to initiate a Fenton like reaction inducing CDT. Meanwhile, Cu2 XSe is used to be an effective photothermal transduction agent for exerting the PTT effect. What's more, the selenium element in Cu2 XSe can regulates selenoprotein to inhibit tumor cells and osteoclasts. Of note, the hyperthermia induced by PTT can further enhance the CDT effect in tumor, achieving a synergistic PTT/CDT effect. Based on these advantages, ICG@Cu2 XSe ZIF 8 effectively suppresses the tumor cells in bone tissue, and reduces the erosion of bone tissue via suppressing osteoclastogenesis. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential action mechanism of ZIF8 capped nanomedicine against osteolysis in bone metastasis.

AB Breast cancer commonly metastasizes to bone where its growth depends on the action of bone resorbing osteoclasts. We have previously shown that breast cancer cells secrete factors able to directly stimulate osteoclastogenesis from receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) primed precursors and that transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) plays a permissive role in this process. Now, we evaluate the signaling events triggered in osteoclast precursors by soluble factors produced by MDA MB 231 human breast carcinoma cells. In mouse bone marrow cultures and RAW 264.7 murine monocytic cells, MDA MB 231 derived factors increased osteoclast number, size, and nucleation. These factors failed to induce Smad2 phosphorylation, and short interfering RNAs against Smad4 did not affect their ability to induce osteoclastogenesis. In contrast, MDA MB 231 factors induced phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2, and pharmacological inhibitors against p38 (SB203580) and MEK1/2(PD98059) impeded the osteoclastogenic effects of cancer derived factors. Neutralizing antibodies against TGF beta attenuated p38 activation, whereas activation of ERK1/2 was shortened in duration, but not decreased in amplitude. ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by cancer derived factors was blocked by MEK1/2 inhibitor, but not by Ras (manumycin A) or Raf (GW5074) inhibitors. Inhibition of protein kinase C alpha using Go6976 prevented both ERK1/2 phosphorylation and osteoclast formation in response to MDA MB 231 derived factors. Using microspectrofluorimetry of fura 2 AM loaded osteoclast precursors, we have found that cancer derived factors, similar to RANKL, induced sustained oscillations in cytosolic free calcium. The calcium chelator BAPTA prevented calcium elevations and osteoclast formation in response to MDA MB 231 derived factors. Thus, we have shown that breast cancer derived factors induce osteoclastogenesis through the activation of calcium/protein kinase C alpha and TGF beta dependent ERK1/2 and p38 signaling pathways.

AB Aim: We investigated the use of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) as drug nanocarriers combining an anti osteoporotic agent, alendronate (ALN), and an anti cancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX). Materials & methods: CNC physicochemical characterization, in vivo imaging coupled with histology and in vitro uptake and toxicity assays were carried out. Results: In vivo CNC ALN did not modify bone tropism and lung penetration, whereas its liver and kidney accumulation was slightly higher compared with CNCs alone. In vitro studies showed that CNC ALN did not impair ALN's effect on osteoclasts, whereas CNC DOX confirmed the therapeutic potential against bone metastatic cancer cells. Conclusions: This study provides robust proof of the potential of CNCs as easy, flexible and specific carriers to deliver compounds to the bone.

AB Introduction: Bone metastasis of breast cancer (BC) is a process in which the disruption of the bone homeostatic microenvironment leads to an increase in osteoclast differentiation. Ailanthus altissima shows an inhibitory effect on osteoclast differentiation. Ailanthone (AIL) refers to a natural compound isolated from Ailanthus altissima, a Chinese herbal medicine, and has effective anti tumor activity in numerous cell lines. Its impact on bone metastases for BC is yet unclear.Methods: We measured the effect of AIL on MDA MB 231 cells by wound healing experiments, Transwell and colony formation experiment. Using the Tartrate resistant Acid Phosphatase (TRAP) staining tests, filamentous (F actin) staining and bone resorption test to detect the effect of AIL on the osteoclast cell differentiation of the Bone Marrow derived Macrophages (BMMs), activated by the MDA MB 231 cell Conditioned Medium (MDA MB 231 CM) and the Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor kappa B Ligand (RANKL),and to explore its possibility Mechanisms. In vivo experiments verified the effect of AIL on bone destruction in breast cancer bone metastasis model mice.Results: In vitro, AIL significantly decrease the proliferation, migration and infiltration abilities of MDA MB 231 cells at a safe concentration, and also reduced the expression of genes and proteins involved in osteoclast formation in MDA MB 231 cells. Osteoclast cell differentiation of the BMMs, activated by MDA MB 231 CM and RANKL, were suppressed by AIL in the concentration dependent manner. Additionally, it inhibits osteoclast specific gene and protein expression. It was noted that AIL inhibited the expression of the osteoclast differentiation related cytokines RANKL and interleukin 1 beta (IL 1 beta) that were secreted by the MDA MB 231 cells after upregulating the Forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) expression. Furthermore, AIL also inhibits the expression of the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK), Phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT), and Nuclear factor kappa B Ligand (NF kappa B) signaling pathways, which then suppresses the MDA MB 231CM induced development of Osteoclasts.Conclusion: Our study shows that AIL blocks osteoclast differentiation in the bone metastasis microenvironment by inhibiting cytokines secreted by BC cells, which may be a potential agent for the treatment of BC and its secondary bone metastasis.

AB Alendronate is the most widely used drug for postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO). It inhibits bone resorption, affecting osteoclasts. Pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of alendronate have been widely studied, but few mathematical models exist to simulate its effect. In this work, we have developed a PK model for alendronate, valid for short  and long term treatments, and a mechanistic PK PD model for the treatment of PMO to predict bone density gain (BDG) at the hip and lumbar spine. According to our results, at least three compartments are required in the PK model to predict the effect of alendronate in both the short and long terms. Clinical data of a 2 year treatment of alendronate, reproduced by our PK PD model, demonstrate that bone response is site specific (hip: 7% BDG, lumbar spine: 4% BDG). We identified that this BDG is mainly due to an increase in tissue mineralization and a decrease in porosity. The difference in BDG between sites is linked to the different loading and dependence of the released alendronate on the bone specific surface and porosity. Osteoclast population diminishes quickly within the first month of alendronate treatment. Osteoblast population lags behind but also falls due to coupling of resorption and formation. Two dosing regimens were studied (70 mg weekly and 10 mg daily), and both showed very similar BDG evolution, indicating that alendronate accumulates quickly in bone and saturates. The proposed PK PD model could provide a valuable tool to analyze the effect of alendronate and to design patient specific treatments, including drug combinations.

AB Shaogan Fuzi Decoction (SGFD), one of the classical prescriptions of Chinese Medicine, has a long history in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but definitive studies on its efficacy and mechanism of action are lacking. This study aims to elucidate the pharmacodynamic role of SGFD against RA and the potential mechanisms based on a combination of network pharmacology and experimental verification. The RA model in rats was induced by intradermal injection of bovine type II collagen and incomplete Freund's adjuvant at the tail root. SGFD was administered once a day by oral gavage for 4 weeks. After SGFD administration, rat's arthritis index (AI) score and paw swelling decreased to some extent, and synovial inflammation, vascular hyperplasia, and cartilage destruction of the ankle joint were improved. Simultaneously, thymus and spleen index and serum levels of C reactive protein (CRP) were lowered. Network pharmacology revealed that quercetin, kaempferol, naringenin, formononetin isorhamnetin and licochalcone A were the potentialiy active components, and IL6, TP53, TNF, PTGS2, MAPK3 and IL 1p were potential key targets for SGFD in the treatment of RA. Ingredients targets molecular docking showed that the components had the high binding activity to these target proteins. The mechanism of SGFD for RA involves various biological functions and is closely correlated with TNF signaling pathway, Osteoclast differentiation, T cell receptor signaling pathway, mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, NF KB signaling pathway, toll like receptor signaling pathway, and so on. Western blot and ELISA showed that the expression of toll like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa B (NF KB) p65, phosphorylated c Jun N terminal kinase (p JNK), p p38, phosphorylated extracellular regulated kinase (p ERK) and TNF a was significantly upregulated in the synovium of RA rats, and the levels of serum inflammatory factors were significantly increased. SGFD inhibits the activation of the TLR4/NF KB/MAPK pathway and the expression/production of pro inflammatory cytokines. In summary, SGFD could improve the symptoms and inflammatory response in collagen induced arthritis (CIA) rat model. The mechanism might be related to the regulation of TLR4/MAPKs/NF KB signaling pathway and the reduction of inflammatory factor release, which partially confirms the results predicted by network pharmacology.

TI Osteoinductive activity of bisdemethoxycurcumin and its synergistic

   ovariectomy induced osteoporosis mouse model

AB Osteoporosis is a common disease characterized by skeletal fragility and microarchitectural deterioration. However, existing conventional drugs exhibit limited efficacy and can elicit severe adverse effects; moreover, and novel stem cell based therapies have not exhibited sufficient therapeutic efficacy. Our hypothesis is that an appropriate osteogenic inducer may improve their therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we found that bisdeme thoxycurcumin (BDMC) stimulates the differentiation of human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) into osteoblasts without inducing cytotoxicity. Here BDMC enhances calcium deposition in hAMSCs, while promoting the expression of early and late markers of osteoblast differentiation, including ALP, runt related transcription factor 2, osterix, COL1 alpha 1, osteocalcin, and osteopontin at the transcriptional and translational levels. Mecha nistically, BDMC was found to activate the JAK2/STAT3 pathway; whereas AG490 (JAK2/STAT3 pathway in hibitor) inhibited BDMC functioning. Subsequently, we found that the combinatorial therapy of BDMC and hAMSC had a positive synergistic effect on osteoporotic mouse model induced by bilateral ovariectomy, including inhibiting bone loss and bone resorption and improving bone micro architecture. Moreover, BDMC inhibited production of the bone resorption markers C terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase, while promoting serum levels of bone formation markers OCN, and procollagen I N terminal propeptide. BDMC also improved liver and kidney function in osteoporotic mouse model. Collectively, BDMC improved osteoporosis by enhancing hAMSC osteogenesis and exhibited a protective effect on liver and kidney function in an osteoporotic mouse model. Hence, BDMC may serve as an effective adjuvant, and com bined therapy with hAMSCs is a promising new approach toward osteoporosis treatment.

AB Artificial prosthesis is wildly used in clinical medicine for degenerative disease such as osteoclast related diseases. However, the material wear particles released from the surface of prostheses cause prosthetic loosening as a result of aseptic osteolysis in long term use. Therefore, it is important to find an agent that inhibits the formation and function of osteoclast for therapeutic use. Notch signaling pathway plays a lot of roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, the role of Notch signaling pathway in osteoclastogenesis remains unclear. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of gamma secretase inhibitor DAPT on osteoclastogenesis via Notch signaling pathway in vitro and titanium particle induced osteolysis in vivo. In animal experiments, the inhibitory effect of DAPT on titanium particle induced osteolysis in a mouse calvaria model was demonstrated. Interestingly, few resorption pits were observed following administration of DAPT and almost no osteoclasts formed at high concentration of DAPT. in vitro experiments revealed the mechanism of the effects of DAPT on osteoclastogenesis. DAPT inhibited the formation and function of osteoclast by blocking RANKL induced Notch2 NF kappa B complex signaling pathway. In conclusion, these results indicated that DAPT could prevent and cure titanium particle induced prosthetic loosening and other osteoclast related diseases.

AB Wang Bi Capsule (WB), a traditional Chinese medicine  (TCM ) based herbal formula, is currently used in clinic for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with positive clinical effects. However, its pharmacological mechanism of action in RA is still obscure. Therefore, this study established a collagen induced arthritis (CIA) mice model to examine the efficacy of WB by using arthritis score, histological analysis, and micro CT examination. Proinflammatory cytokines expression, osteoclast number, OPG/RANKL system, and NF kappa B activation were then detected to further investigate the mechanism of WB in RA treatment. The results indicated that WB could alleviate the erythema and swelling of paws in CIA mice. It also inhibited the infiltration of inflammatory cells and bone destruction and increased bone density in joints of CIA mice. Mechanistic studies showed that WB treatment decreased the production of IL 1 beta, IL 6, and TNF alpha in serum and joints of CIA mice. Moreover, it reduced the osteoclast number, increased OPG level, decreased RANKL level, and inhibited the activation of NF kappa B in joints of CIA mice. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that WB could effectively alleviate disease progression of CIA mice by decreasing the IL 1 beta, IL 6, and TNF alpha levels, modulating the OPG/RANKL system, and inhibiting the activation of NF kappa B.

AB Approximately 25 40% of patients with lung cancer show bone metastasis. Bone modifying agents reduce skeletal related events (SREs), but they do not significantly improve overall survival. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches are urgently required. In this study, we investigated the anti tumor effect of TAS 115, a VEGFRs and HGF receptor (MET) targeted kinase inhibitor, in a tumor induced bone disease model. A549 Luc BM1 cells, an osteo tropic clone of luciferase transfected A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549 Luc), produced aggressive bone destruction associated with tumor progression after intratibial (IT) implantation into mice. TAS 115 significantly reduced IT tumor growth and bone destruction. Histopathological analysis showed a decrease in tumor vessels after TAS 115 treatment, which might be mediated through VEGFRs inhibition. Furthermore, the number of osteoclasts surrounding the tumor was decreased after TAS 115 treatment. In vitro studies demonstrated that TAS 115 inhibited HGF , VEGF , and macrophage colony stimulating factor (M CSF) induced signaling pathways in osteoclasts. Moreover, TAS 115 inhibited Feline McDonough Sarcoma oncogene (FMS) kinase, as well as M CSF and receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand (RANKL) induced osteoclast differentiation. Thus, VEGFRs/MET/FMS triple inhibition in osteoclasts might contribute to the potent efficacy of TAS 115. The fact that concomitant dosing of sunitinib (VEGFRs/FMS inhibition) with crizotinib (MET inhibition) exerted comparable inhibitory efficacy for bone destruction to TAS 115 also supports this notion. In conclusion, TAS 115 inhibited tumor growth via VEGFR kinase blockade, and also suppressed bone destruction possibly through VEGFRs/MET/FMS kinase inhibition, which resulted in potent efficacy of TAS 115 in an A549 Luc BM1 bone disease model. Thus, TAS 115 shows promise as a novel therapy for lung cancer patients with bone metastasis.

AB Medical device associated osteomyelitis is a complication in orthopedic surgery, and often caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms. There is an urgent need for the discovery of biodegradable therapies with bone restoring properties, which can additionally hamper biofilms development. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption and are used e.g. in the treatment of osteoporosis. In turn, bioactive glass is a biodegradable material, which is used to resolve infection induced bone defects due to its anti biofilm and osteostimulative properties. Combining bioactive glass with bisphosphonates has attracted interest due to their synergistic effects on improved bone formation in orthopedic and dental applications. Our previous study showed that the addition of bisphosphonates (alendronate, etidronate, risedronate and zoledronate) improves the anti biofilm effect of bioactive glass (S53P4; BAG) against periodontal biofilms (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). In the present study, we studied the anti biofilm effects of these bisphosphonate BAG combinations on Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms as a plausible therapeutic alternative for the treatment of medical device associated osteomyelitis. It was demonstrated that alendronate, etidronate and risedronate displayed anti biofilm activity either when used alone or in combination with BAG. Overall, these results support a promising role of bisphosphonates in managing medical device associated osteomyelitis, which it is worth exploring further. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Healing bone erosions in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains greatly challenging via biomaterial strategies. Given the unsuccessful innate bone erosion healing due to an inflammatory disorder, over activated osteoclasts, and impaired osteoblasts differentiation, RA pathogenesis guided engineering of an innovative hydrogel platform is needed for remodeling osteoimmune and osteogenic microenvironment of bone erosion healing. Herein, in situ adaptable and injectable interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogel is developed through an ingenious combination of a bio orthogonal reaction between hyaluronic acid (HA) and collagen, along with effective electrostatic interactions leveraging bisphosphonate (BP) functionalized HA macromers (HABP) and nanorod shaped zinc (Zn) doped biphasic calcium phosphate (ZnBCP). IPN hydrogel exhibits exceptional adaptability to the local shape complexity at bone erosions, and by integrating ZnBCP and HABP, a multi stage releasing platform is engineered, facilitating controlled cargo delivery for remodeling more anti inflammatory M2 cells and reducing over activated osteoclastic activities, thereby reconstructing the bone regeneration microenvironment. Sustainedly co delivering multiple ions (calcium and phosphate) can display excellent osteogenic properties and be conducive to the bone formation process, by effects of osteogenesis associated cell differentiation. Overall, the introduced bioactive IPN hydrogel therapy remodels the osteoimmune environment by synergistic pro inflammation resolving, osteogenesis, and anti osteoclastic activities, displaying excellent bone reconstruction in the collagen induced arthritis rabbit model.
   Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis guided engineering of an innovative interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogel platform is designed to remodel osteoimmune and osteogenic microenvironment crucial for healing bone erosion. This hydrogel can increase M2 macrophage polarization, suppress osteoclast activity and accelerate osteogenesis to achieve bone reconstruction by releasing bisphosphonates (BPs) and multiply ions (calcium, phosphate, and zinc). image

AB Pharmacological studies have shown that Cedrol (CE) exhibits extensive biological activities, including anti inflammatory and analgesic. Moreover, it can inhibit the NF kappa B pathway and the expression of various associated proteins. This study aimed to investigate the role of CE in postmenopausal osteoporosis. The results showed that intragastric administration of CE (10 and 20 mg/kg) significantly improved the bone microstructure damage and increased bone mineral density, trabecular bone volume, and bone trabecular thickness in ovariectomized (OVX) rats (p < 0.05). CE treatment additionally made a well organized arrangement of bone trabeculae and improved its thickness and density. Compared with the OVX group, the levels of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase from 5b and C terminal telopeptide of type I collagen were significantly reduced by 42.75% and 49.27% in the OVX + CE rats (p < 0.05). TRAP staining visually showed that the number of osteoclasts in the femur tissue of CE treated rats was less than that of the OVX group. The expressions of nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1, acid phosphatase 5, and cathepsin K in OVX + CE rats were significantly decreased by 51.61%, 46.07%, and 50.34% compared to the OVX group (p < 0.01). In addition, CE intervention effectively reduced the phosphorylation levels of P65 and I kappa B alpha and inhibited the NF kappa B signaling pathway. Meanwhile, CE diminished the number of multinucleated osteoclasts induced by receptor activator for nuclear factor kappa B ligand and hindered cell fusion as well as nuclear translocation of osteoclast precursor cells P65. In conclusion, CE inhibits osteoclastogenesis by suppressing the activation of the NF kappa B signaling pathway, thereby alleviating postmenopausal osteoporosis.

AB Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most frequent primary malignant bone tumor in urgent need of better therapies. Using genetically modified mouse models (GEMMs), we demonstrate that Wnt signaling promotes c Fos induced OS formation via the actions of the collagen modifying enzyme Loxl2. c Fos/AP 1 directly regulates the expression of the Wnt ligandsWnt7bandWnt9ain OS cells through promoter binding, and Wnt7b and Wnt9a in turn promote Loxl2 expression in murine and human OS cells through the transcription factors Zeb1 and Zeb2. Concordantly, inhibition of Wnt ligand secretion by inactivating theWnt less(Wls)gene in osteoblasts in c Fos GEMMs either early or in a therapeutic setting reduces Loxl2 expression and progression of OS. Wls deficient osteosarcomas proliferate less, are less mineralized and are enriched in fibroblastic cells surrounded by collagen fibers. Importantly, Loxl2 inhibition using either the pan Lox inhibitor BAPN or a specific inducible shRNA reduces OS cell proliferation in vitro and decreases tumor growth and lung colonization in murine and human orthotopic OS transplantation models. Finally, OS development is delayed in c Fos GEMMs treated with BAPN or with specific Loxl2 blocking antibodies. Congruently, a strong correlation between c FOS, LOXL2 and WNT7B/WNT9A expression is observed in human OS samples, and c FOS/LOXL2 co expression correlates with OS aggressiveness and decreased patient survival. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of Wnt and/or Loxl2 should be considered to potentiate the inadequate current treatments for pediatric, recurrent, and metastatic OS.

AB Background. Drynariae Rhizoma (DR) has been widely used in the prevention and treatment of various fractures. However, the specific mechanisms of DR's active ingredients have not been elucidated. The purpose of this study was to explore the synergistic mechanisms of DR for treating fracture. Methods. A network pharmacology approach integrating ingredient screening, target exploration, active ingredients gene target network construction, protein protein interaction network construction, molecular docking, gene protein classification, gene ontology (GO) functional analysis, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, and signaling pathway integration was used. Results. This approach identified 17 active ingredients of DR, interacting with 144 common gene targets and 143 protein targets of DR and fracture. NCOA1, GSK3B, TTPA, and MAPK1 were identified as important gene targets. Five most important protein targets were also identified, including MAPK1, SRC, HRAS, RXRA, and NCOA1. Molecular docking found that DR has a good binding potential with common protein targets. GO functional analysis indicated that common genes involve multiple processes, parts and functions in biological process, cellular component, and molecular function, including positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, signal transduction, cytosol, extracellular exosome, cytoplasm, and protein binding. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that common gene targets play a role in repairing fractures in multiple signaling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K/AKT, Ras, and VEGF signaling pathways. MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways were involved in osteoblast formation, Ras signaling pathway was involved in enhancing mesenchymal stromal cell migration, and VEGF signaling pathway was involved in angiogenesis. Conclusion. The study revealed the correlation between DR and fracture and the potential synergistic mechanism of different targets of DR in the treatment of fractures, which provides a reference for the development of new drugs.

AB Introduction: Osteoporosis, characterized by dysregulation of osteoclastic bone resorption and osteoblastic bone formation, severely threatens human health during aging. However, there is still no good therapy for osteoporosis, so this direction requires our continuous attention, and there is an urgent need for new drugs to solve this problem. Methods: Traditional Chinese Medicine Salvia divinorum monomer pomolic acid (PA) could effectively inhibit osteoclastogenesis and ovariectomized osteoporosis. However, its poor solubility and lack of targeting severely limits its further application. A novel bone targeting nanomedicine (PA@TLipo) has been developed to reconstruct the osteoporotic microenvironment by encapsulating pomolic acid in alendronate functionalized liposomes. Through a series of operations such as synthesis, purification, encapsulation, and labeling, the PA@TLipo have been prepared. Moreover, the cytotoxicity, bone targeting and anti osteoporosis effect was verified by cell and animal experiments. Results: In the aspect of targeting, the PA@TLipo can effectively aggregate on the bone tissue to reduce bone loss, and in terms of toxicity, PA@TLipo could increase the bone target ability in comparison to nontargeted liposome, thereby mitigating systemic cytotoxicity. Moreover, PA@TLipo inhibited osteoclast formation and bone resorption in vitro and reduced bone loss in ovariectomyinduced osteoporotic mice. Conclusion: In this study, a novel therapeutic agent was designed and constructed to treat osteoporosis, consisting of a liposome material as the drug pocket, PA as the anti osteoporosis drug, and ALN as the bone targeting molecule. And our study is the first to employ a bone targeted delivery system to deliver PA for OVX induced bone loss, providing an innovative solution for treating osteoporosis.

TI Acer tegmentosum Maxim Prevents Bone Loss by Inhibiting
   Osteoclastogenesis and Promoting Osteoblast Mineralization in
   Ovariectomized Mice
SO NATURAL PRODUCT SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Osteoporosis is a worldwide disease leading to significant economic and societal burdens globally. Osteoporosis is caused by unbalanced bone remodeling between the rate of osteoclast bone resorption and osteoblast bone formation. Acer tegmentosum Maxim (AT) is a traditional herbal medicine containing multiple biological activities such as anti oxidant and anti inflammatory purposes. However, its role in osteoporosis has not been fully studied. Therefore, we investigated whether AT has a potent inhibitory effect on osteoporosis and its mechanism through a systemic evaluation in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. OVX mice were orally administrated with the AT at doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg for 10 weeks. Histological images and histomorphometry analyses were performed by H&E and Toluidine blue satin, and the expression levels of receptor activator for nuclear factor kB ligand (RANKL), nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasm 1 (NFATc1), c Fos, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) related to the osteoclast differentiation were investigated using immunohistochemical analysis. Administration of AT prevented bone loss and the alternations of osteoporotic bone parameters at the distinct regions of the distal femur and spongiosa region in OVX mice. Further, administration of AT increased periosteal bone formation in a dose dependent manner. Meanwhile, AT inhibited not only the expression of NFATc1 and c Fos, which are two major regulators of osteoclastogenesis but also reduced bone resorbed encoding expression of MMP9 and RANKL. Our results indicated that administration of AT prevented bone loss and the alternations of osteoporotic bone parameters at the distinct regions of the distal femur and spongiosa region in OVX mice. Also AT has the bone protective effect through the suppression of osteoclast and promotion of osteoblast, suggesting that it could be a preventive and therapeutic candidate for anti osteoporosis.

AB Systemic mastocytosis can give very different bone pictures: from osteosclerosis to osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is one of the most frequent manifestations particularly in adults and the most clinically relevant. It is often complicated by a high recurrence of mainly vertebral fragility fractures. The main factor of bone loss is the osteoclast with a relative or absolute predominance of bone resorption. The RANK RANKL pathway seems of key importance, but histamine and other cytokines also play a significant role in the process. The predominance of resorption made bisphosphonates, as antiresorptive drugs, the most rational treatment of bone involvement in systemic mastocytosis.

AB Background: During osteoporosis, bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) lineage commitment shifts to adipocytes, causing fat accumulation and bone loss in the skeleton. Seeking drugs that could reverse the adipocyte fate determination of BMSCs is critical for osteoporosis therapy. As a traditional Chinese medicine, Rhizoma Curculiginis (Xianmao) has been used to treat bone diseases and promote bone healing, while the effective constituent of it and the underlying mechanisms are unknown.
   Objectives: The aim of this study is to unveil the role of orcinol glucoside (OG), one constituent of Rhizoma Curculiginis, in osteoporosis and BMSCs lineage commitment and to explore the underlying mechanisms.
   Methods: Micro CT and three point bending test were performed to determine the effect of OG on bone structure and strength. qT PCR and Western blot were performed to determine the expression of osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation markers in BMSCs. Mineralization in differentiated BMSCs was assessed by Alizarin Red staining, and lipid accumulation in the cells was evaluated by Oil Red O staining. All measurements were performed at least three times.
   Results: OG prevented bone loss by stimulating bone formation and attenuating fat formation in bone. In vitro, OG promoted osteoblastic differentiation and inhibited adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Inhibition of Wnt/beta catenin by ICG 001 significantly reversed the effect of OG on osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the role of OG in alleviating bone loss and fat accumulation in osteoporotic bone, therefore bringing a new therapeutic means to the treatment of osteoporosis.

AB Type 2 diabetes mellitus is often companied with osteoporosis, a process which involves osteoclast activation. In this study, we found tubeimoside I, a natural compound isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb Bolbostemma paniculatum (Maxim) Franquet (Cucurbitaceae), significantly ameliorated the decrease of bone mass in type 2 diabetes induced osteoporosis in rats. It appears that tubeimoside I exerts this protecting effect through inhibiting osteoclast formation and function. Futhermore, our study showed that tubeimoside I inhibits NF kappa B transcriptional activation and degradation of I kappa B alpha. Collectively, our results reveal that tubeimoside I attenuates osteoclastogenesis through down regulating NF kappa B signaling pathway, and is a potential candidate for the treatment of bone destructive diseases like type 2 diabetic osteoporosis.

AB We have previously shown that different vanadium(IV) complexes regulate osteoblastic growth. Since vanadium compounds are accumulated in vivo in bone, they may affect bone turnover. The development of vanadium complexes with different ligands could be an alternative strategy of use in skeletal tissue engineering. In this study, we have investigated the osteogenic properties of a vanadyl(IV) ascorbate (VOAsc) complex, as well as its possible mechanisms of action, on two osteoblastic cell lines in culture. VOAsc (2.5 25 mu M) significantly stimulated osteoblastic proliferation (113 125% basal, p < 0.01) in UMR106 cells, but not in the MC3T3E1 cell line. VOAsc (5 100 mu M) dose dependently stimulated type I collagen production (107 156% basal) in osteoblasts. After 3 weeks of culture, 5 25 mu M VOAsc increased the formation of nodules of mineralization in MC3T3E1 cells (7.7 20 fold control, p < 0.001). VOAsc (50 100 mu M) significantly stimulated apoptosis in both cell lines (170 230% basal, p < 0.02 0.002), but did not affect reactive oxygen species production. The complex inhibited alkaline and neutral phosphatases from osteoblastic extracts with semi maximal effect at 10 mu M doses. VOAsc induced the activation and redistribution of P ERK in a time  and dose dependent manner. Inhibitors of the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway (PD98059 and U0126) partially blocked the VOAsc enhanced osteoblastic proliferation and collagen production. In addition, wortmanin, a PI 3 K inhibitor and type L channel blocker nifedipine also partially abrogated these effects of VOAsc on osteoblasts. Our in vitro results suggest that this vanadyl(IV) ascorbate complex could be a useful pharmacological tool for bone tissue regeneration. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Bu Shen Ning Xin decoction (BSNXD) is a traditional Chinese medicinal composition that has been used as a remedy for postmenopausal osteoporosis, but the mechanisms affecting bone metabolism are not fully understood.
   Purpose: We investigated the molecular mechanism and signaling pathway underlying the effect of BSNXD on osteoclastogenesis.
   Materials and methods: A postmenopausal osteoporosis animal model generated by ovariectomy was administered BSNXD and drug derived serum was prepared. An enzyme immunoassay was conducted to measure the 17 beta estradiol (E2) concentration in the drug derived serum. Bone marrow derived monocyte/macrophage precursor cells were treated with drug derived serum, and tartrate resistance acid phosphatase staining was conducted to observe osteoclastogenesis. A bone resorption assay was performed to analyze the effect on osteoclastic resorptive function. Real time PCR, flow cytometry, Western blotting, transfection, and luciferase assays were conducted to explore the related mechanism.
   Results: E2 was not elevated in BSNXD derived serum. BSNXD derived serum suppressed receptor activation of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) activated osteoclastogenesis in a dose dependent manner; this effect could be reversed by estrogen receptor alpha antagonist methyl piperidino pyrazole. The serum suppressed RANKL induced NF kappa B transcription and inhibited the accumulation of nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 in osteoclast precursor cells; the inhibitory effect was abolished by methyl piperidino pyrazole but not the estrogen receptor beta antagonist or androgen receptor antagonist.
   Conclusion: These results collectively suggest that administration of BSNXD presents inhibitory effects on osteoclast differentiation by abrogating the RANKL induced nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 and NF kappa B signaling pathways downstream of estrogen receptor alpha, thereby contributing to the inhibitory effect on bone resorption.

AB Although different types of drugs are available for postmenopausal osteoporosis, the limitations of the current therapies including drug resistances and adverse effects require identification of novel anti osteoporosis agents. Here, we defined that norlichexanthone (NOR), a natural product, is a ligand of estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) and revealed its therapeutic potential for postmenopausal osteoporosis. We used mammalian one hybrid assay to screen for ER alpha modulators from crude extracts of several plant endophytes. As a result, NOR purified from the extract of endophyte ARL 13 was identified as a selective ER alpha modulator. NOR directly bound to ER alpha with an affinity in nanomolar range, revealing that it is a natural ligand of ER alpha. NOR induced osteoblast formation in MC3T3 E1 precursor cells. Conversely, NOR inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) induced osteoclast formation in both RAW264.7 macrophages and mouse primary monocytes. Mechanistically, NOR inhibited RANKL induced association of ER alpha and TRAF6 to prevent ER alpha mediated TRAF6 activation via Lys63 linked ubiquitination. Importantly, NOR exhibited potent anti osteoporosis efficacy in an ovariectomized mouse model. Comparing to estrogen, NOR was of much less capability in stimulating endometrial hyperplasia and promoting mammalian cancer cell proliferation. Taken together, our study identified NOR as a natural and high affinity ligand of ER alpha with substantial anti osteoporosis but less estrogenic activity.

AB Osteoporosis (OP) is one of the common bone metabolic diseases that endangers postmenopausal women and the elders. Both excessive bone resorption caused by osteoclast over activation and increased oxidative stress are associated with osteoporosis. Cinnamtannin B 1 (CB 1) is considered as a high valued plant extract monomer due to its antioxidant properties. However, the mechanism of CB 1 impacts on reducing oxidative stress, inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and osteoclast differentiation and preventing ovariectomy induced osteoporosis are still unclear. In this study, the effects of CB 1 on nuclear factor kappa B (RANKL) induced osteoclasts formation and differentiationin vitroand the potential therapeutic effect on ovariectomy (OVX) induced osteoporosisin vivoare investigated. CB 1 was found to inhibit osteoclast formation and bone resorption function in a dose dependent manner, and it inhibited specific genes related to osteoclast as well. Micro CT and histopathological staining showed that CB 1 can effectively prevent OVX induced osteoporosis. In addition, CB 1 treatment can effectively inhibit the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)in vivoandin vitro. Mechanistically, CB 1 inhibits the activation of osteoclasts by inhibiting the activation of the NF kappa B signaling pathway. In conclusion, CB 1 would be able to be used as a promising new drug strategy to inhibit RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis and prevent ovariectomy induced osteoporosis.

AB Brevilin A (BA) is the primary component of Centipeda minima, which is widely used in Chinese traditional medicine. The anti inflammatory and anti tumor properties of BA have been established; however, its function in bone metabolism is not well understood. This study revealed that concentrations of BA below 1.0 mu M did not inhibit the proliferation of bone marrow macrophages but did impede the differentiation and bone resorption activity of osteoclasts. Furthermore, BA suppressed the expression of osteoclast specific genes Mmp9, Acp5, Dc stamp, Ctsk, and Atp6v0d2. In addition, mTOR, ERK, and NFATc1 activation in bone marrow macrophages were suppressed by BA. As a whole, BA blocks the mTOR and ERK signaling pathways, which is responsible for the development and activity of osteoclasts, and the resorption of bone.

TI Interleukin 4 Inhibits RANKL Induced NFATc1 Expression Via STAT6: A
   Novel Mechanism Mediating its Blockade of Osteoclastogenesis

AB Interleukin 4 (IL 4) is an important immune regulatory protein that possesses potent anti osteoclastogenic properties, and does so via the transcription factor STAT6. Previous studies have shown that IL 4 selectively blocks RANKL induced activation of NF kappa B and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway molecules, suggesting that the cytokine arrests osteoclastogenesis by blockade of these signaling cascades. However, the fact that the inhibitory effect on these pathways requires prolonged IL 4 pretreatment, and that the cytokine fails to exert an anti osteoclastogenic effect after short term pre exposure of RANKL to osteoclast precursors, suggests that an additional, more immediate mechanism may also be involved. In this study, we found that simultaneous exposure of IL 4 did not alter RANKL dependent activation of NF kappa B or MAPKs, whereas the cytokine did block RANKL induced nuclear factor activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), a master osteoclastogenic transcription factor. This inhibitory effect of IL 4 required STAT6, consistent with its functional role in osteoclastogenesis. In addition, the cytokine also partially impaired RANKL stimulated bone resorption. Furthermore, IL 4 suppressed expression of RANKL induced osteoclast specific genes in a STAT6 dependent manner, but failed to do so when osteoclast precursors were pre exposed to RANKL. Thus, we provide the first evidence that IL 4 inhibits osteoclast formation by inhibiting RANKL induction of NFATc1 via STAT6 as an early event, in addition to its suppression of other signaling pathways. The inhibitory effect is ultimately regulated at the gene expression transcriptional level. J. Cell. Biochem. 112: 3385 3392, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The key nuclear export protein CRM1/XPO1 may represent a promising novel therapeutic target in human multiple myeloma (MM). Here we showed that chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1) is highly expressed in patients with MM, plasma cell leukemia cells and increased in patient cells resistant to bortezomib treatment. CRM1 expression also correlates with increased lytic bone and shorter survival. Importantly, CRM1 knockdown inhibits MM cell viability. Novel, oral, irreversible selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINEs) targeting CRM1 (KPT 185, KPT 330) induce cytotoxicity against MM cells (ED50 <200 nM), alone and cocultured with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) or osteoclasts (OC). SINEs trigger nuclear accumulation of multiple CRM1 cargo tumor suppressor proteins followed by growth arrest and apoptosis in MM cells. They further block c myc, Mcl 1, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) activity. SINEs induce proteasome dependent CRM1 protein degradation; concurrently, they upregulate CRM1, p53 targeted, apoptosis related, anti inflammatory and stress related gene transcripts in MM cells. In SCID mice with diffuse human MM bone lesions, SINEs show strong anti MM activity, inhibit MM induced bone lysis and prolong survival. Moreover, SINEs directly impair osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption via blockade of RANKL induced NF kappa B and NFATc1, with minimal impact on osteoblasts and BMSCs. These results support clinical development of SINE CRM1 antagonists to improve patient outcome in MM.

AB Bone fractures in patients with diabetes mellitus heal poorly and require innovative therapies to support bone regeneration. Here, we assessed whether sulfated hyaluronan included in collagen based scaffold coatings can improve fracture healing in diabetic rats. Macroporous thermopolymerized lactide based scaffolds were coated with collagen including non sulfated or sulfated hyaluronan (HA/sHA3) and inserted into 3 mm femoral defects of non diabetic and diabetic ZDF rats. After 12 weeks, scaffolds coated with collagen/HA or collagen/sHA3 accelerated bone defect regeneration in diabetic, but not in non diabetic rats as compared to their non coated controls. At the tissue level, collagen/sHA3 promoted bone mineralization and decreased the amount of non mineralized bone matrix. Moreover, collagen/sHA3 coated scaffolds from diabetic rats bound more sclerostin in vivo than the respective controls. Binding assays confirmed a high binding affinity of sHA3 to sclerostin. In vitro, sHA3 induced BMP 2 and lowered the RANKL/OPG expression ratio, regardless of the glucose concentration in osteoblastic cells. Both sHA3 and high glucose concentrations decreased the differentiation of osteoclastic cells. In summary, scaffolds coated with collagen/sHA3 represent a potentially suitable biomaterial to improve bone defect regeneration in diabetic conditions. The underlying mechanism involves improved osteoblast function and binding sclerostin, a potent inhibitor of Wnt signaling and osteoblast function. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Osteochondral defects, characterized by structural compromises to articular cartilage and subchondral bone, can cause pain and lead to progressive cartilage damage and eventual osteoarthritis. Unfortunately, repairing these defects remains difficult because of the poor regenerative properties of cartilage and complex mechanical demands of the joint. As such, the field of tissue engineering aims to develop multiphasic implants that replace pathological cartilage and bone tissue and restore mechanical functionality to the joint. Recent bone physiology investigations have demonstrated that osteoclast (OC) lineage cells are inextricably involved in osteoblastic bone formation through an extensive network of anabolic signaling pathways, and so the codelivery OC and osteoblast (OB) lineage cells within scaffolds is being actively explored for bone tissue engineering purposes. However, it remains unclear how these cells can be incorporated into the design of multiphasic osteochondral scaffolds to potentially enhance subchondral bone formation and subsequent implant osseointegration. To explore this question, we examined direct surface seeding and hydrogel encapsulation as potential scaffold cellularization strategies. First, we examined how OC precursor cells and peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) influence early stage bone matrix development and osteogenesis in 2D coculture. Then, we evaluated the osteogenic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and PBMCs cocultures encapsulated within a gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel system. Our findings demonstrate that coculturing PBMCs with MSCs in 2D cultures significantly enhanced cell proliferation, early bone matrix deposition, and the formation of cell clusters by Day 28. However, we observed no significant difference in type I collagen deposition between GelMA hydrogel scaffolds cultured in basal and OC conditions during the same period. In addition, we found that the GelMA hydrogel system with MSC/PBMC cocultures in OC conditions exhibited decreased osteogenic activity by Day 28. Collectively, our findings support the osteogenic potential of OC lineage cells in 2D culture conditions, and the potential benefits of surface seeding for the codelivery of OC lineage cells and MSCs in osteo scaffolds for enhanced osteochondral regeneration and broader bone tissue engineering purposes.
   Impact Statement This work provides insight into incorporating osteoblast and osteoclast lineage cells into the design of 3D printed osteochondral tissue engineering scaffolds. The findings from this work provide a platform to capitalize on osteoclast directed bone formation towards the development of improved regenerative therapies for osteochondral and bone defects.

AB Osteoclasts derived from the monocyte/macrophage hematopoietic lineage regulate bone resorption, a process balanced by bone formation in the continual renewal of the skeletal system. As dysfunctions of these cells result in bone metabolic diseases such as osteoporosis and osteopetrosis, the exploration of the mechanisms regulating their differentiation is a priority. A potential mechanism may involve long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are known to regulate various cell biology activities, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The expression of the lncRNA AK077216 (Lnc AK077216) is significantly upregulated during osteoclastogenesis identified by microarray and verified by qPCR. Up  and downregulation of Lnc AK077216, respectively promotes and inhibits osteoclast differentiation, bone resorption, and the expression of related genes on the basis of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase staining, qPCR, and western blot results. In addition, Lnc AK077216 suppresses NIP45 expression and promotes the expression of NFATc1, an essential transcription factor during osteoclastogenesis. Besides, it was found that the expression of Lnc AK077216 and Nfatc1 is upregulated, whereas Nip45 expression is downregulated in bone marrow and spleen tissues of ovariectomized mice. The results suggest that Lnc AK077216 regulates NFATc1 expression and promotes osteoclast formation and function, providing a novel mechanism of osteoclastogenesis and a potential biomarker or a new drug target for osteoporosis.

AB Objective. To explore the mechanism of Shaoyao Gancao decoction (SGD) in treatment of alopecia areata (AA) by network pharmacology and animal experiments. Methods Based on the traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and analysis platform (TCMSP), the components and targets of SGD were determined. Then, the related targets of AA were retrieved from DrugBank, GeneCards, OMIM, and DisGeNET databases. The intersection of drug targets and disease targets was determined, and the key targets of the protein protein interaction network were obtained with the String database. Gene Ontology (GO) biological process enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of potential key targets were carried out using the DAVID database using AutoDock for molecular docking verification. Finally, the key pathway was validated by animal experiments. Results. A total of 102 active components, 212 predicted targets, and 812 AA disease related targets were obtained. Topological analysis yielded 45 key targets of SGD in the treatment of AA, including IL 6, PTGS2, TNF, VEGFA, CCL2, IL 1B, CXCL8, CASP3, MPO, and IL 10. There were 324 GO entries obtained through GO biological process enrichment analysis, and 20 pathways were obtained through KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, involving the PI3K Akt signaling pathway, osteoclast differentiation, and Jak STAT signaling pathway. The molecular docking results showed effective ingredients (quercetin, kaempferol, and 7 methoxy 2 methyl isoflavone) have good docking results with targets (IL 6, PTGS2, and TNF). The results of animal experiments showed that SGD can effectively upregulate the expression of PI3K and AKT proteins. Conclusion. This is the first in depth study on the mechanism of SGD's treatment effect in AA using network pharmacology, and preliminary animal experiments verified that it is closely related to the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This finding may provide a new basis for SGD's clinical application in AA.

AB IntroductionThe in vitro expansion and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow (BM hMSCs) are considered as potential therapeutic tools for clinical applications in bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, invasive sampling and reduction in number and proliferative capacity with age are the major limitations of BM hMSCs. Recently, human placenta derived MSCs (PL hMSCs) obtained by a non invasive procedure have attracted much interest. Attempts to increase the potential of PL hMSCs would be an important paradigm in regenerative medicine. Herein, we examined the proliferative and osteogenic effect of andrographolide (AP) on PL hMSCs.MethodsMesenchymal stem cells were isolated from full term normal human placentas and were characterized before using. Cell cytotoxicity and proliferative effect of AP were examined by MTT and BrdU assay, respectively. The non toxicity concentrations of AP were further assessed for osteogenic effect determined by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression and activity, alizarin red staining, and osteoblast specific gene expressions. Screening of genes involved in osteogenic differentiation related pathways modulated by AP was explored by a NanoString nCounter analysis.ResultsPL hMSCs generated in this study met the MSC criteria set by the International Society of Cellular Therapy. The non cytotoxic concentrations of AP on PL hMSCs are up to 10 mu M. The compound increased PL hMSC proliferation concomitant with increases in Wnt/beta  catenin level and activity. It also enhanced osteogenic differentiation in association with osteoblast specific mRNA expression. Further, AP promoted bone formation and increased bone structural protein level, osteocalcin, in osteoblastic cells. Gene screening analysis showed the upregulation of genes related to Wnt/beta  catenin, TGF beta /BMP, SMAD, and FGF signaling pathways.ConclusionWe demonstrated, for the first time, the potential role of AP in promoting proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and osteoblast bone formation of PL hMSCs. This study suggests that AP may be an effective novel agent for the improvement of PL hMSCs and stem cell based therapy for bone regeneration.

AB Multiple myeloma is a tumor of terminally differentiated plasma cells that home to and expand in the bone marrow. It is the second most common hematologic malignancy, with approximately 16,000 new cases per year, and accounts for an estimated 11,000 deaths in the USA. It is the most common cancer to metastasize to bone, with up to 90% of patients developing bone lesions. The bone lesions are purely osteolytic in nature, and up to 60% of patients develop a pathologic fracture over the course of their disease. Bone disease is a hallmark of multiple myeloma, and the bone disease differs from other bone metastasis caused by other tumors. Although both myeloma and other osteolytic metastasis induce increased osteoclastic bone resorption, in contrast to other tumors, osteoblast activity in myeloma is either severely decreased or absent. The basis for this severe imbalance between increased osteoclastic bone resorption and decreased bone formation resulting from suppressed osteoblastic activity has been a topic of extensive investigation during the last several years. The clinical consequences of this extensive accelerated and imbalanced bone destruction process include bone pain, pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia and spinal cord compression syndromes, which can be devastating for patients and significantly impact overall quality of life and expected survival. In this chapter, we will discuss the pathophysiology underlying bone disease in myeloma. This results from the uncoupling of bone remodeling and is characterized by markedly increased activity of osteoclasts and profound decreased activity of osteoblasts. In addition, we also review the emerging data on novel targeted therapies aimed at ameliorating myeloma bone disease.

AB A Summary The skeletal renin angiotensin system contributes to the development of osteoporosis. The renin inhibitor aliskiren exhibited beneficial effects on trabecular bone of osteoporotic mice, and this action might be mediated through angiotensin and bradykinin receptor pathways. This study implies the potential application of renin inhibitor in the management for postmenopausal osteoporosis.
   Introduction The skeletal renin angiotensin system plays key role in the pathological process of osteoporosis. The present study is designed to elucidate the effect of renin inhibitor aliskiren on trabecular bone and its potential action mechanism in ovariectomized (OVX) mice.
   Methods The OVX mice were treated with low dose (5 mg/kg) or high dose (25 mg/kg) of aliskiren or its vehicle for 8 weeks. The bone turnover markers were measured by ELISA. The structural parameters of trabecular bone at lumbar vertebra (LV) and distal femoral metaphysis were measured by micro CT. The expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein was studied by RT PCR and immunoblotting, respectively.
   Results Aliskiren treatment reduced urinary excretion of calcium and serum level of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase in OVX mice. The treatment with aliskiren significantly increased bone volume (BV/TV) and connectivity density (Conn.D) of trabecular bone at LV 2 and LV 5 as well as dramatically enhanced BV/TV, Conn.D, bone mineral density (BMD/BV) and decreased bone surface (BS/BV) at the distal femoral end. Aliskiren significantly down regulated the expression of angiotensinogen, angiotensin II (Ang II), Ang II type 1 receptor, bradykinin receptor (BR) 1, and osteocytic specific gene sclerostin as well as the osteoclast specific genes, including carbonic anhydrase II, matrix metalloproteinase 9, and cathepsin K.
   Conclusions This study revealed that renin inhibitor aliskiren exhibited the beneficial effects on trabecular bone of ovariectomy induced osteoporotic mice, and the underlying mechanism for this action might be mediated through Ang II and BR signaling pathways in bone.

AB Background ChondroT is a complex herbal medicine consisting of water extracts of Ostericum koreanum (Maxim.) Kitag., Lonicera japonica Thunb., Angelica gigas Nakai, Clematis manshurica Rupr., and Phellodendron amurense Rupr. (6:4:4:4:3). Previous studies have reported that ChondroT possesses chondroprotective and anti inflammatory, anti osteoarthritic, and anti hyperuricemic activities. The study is aim to demonstrate the effects of ChondroT and its five constituent herbs on receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand (RANKL) induced osteoclastogenesis and the underlying mechanisms. Methods Osteoclastogenesis was identified in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) by tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining assay, actin ring formation assay and the bone resorption assay. For the molecular mechanisms, activation of RANKL induced NF kappa B and MAPK signaling pathways and the expression levels of osteoclast specific proteins were investigated by Western blotting. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. Actin ring formation and NF kappa B translocation were evaluated by immunostaining. Results ChondroT and each of its constituent herbs significantly suppressed osteoclast differentiation dose dependently, and decreased actin ring formation as well as bone resorbing capacity. Mechanistically, ChondroT and its constituent herbs downregulated the expressional levels of osteoclast specific proteins such as NFATc1, c Fos, Cathepsin K, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) by suppressing NF kappa B translocation to nucleus and MAPKs phosphorylation at different levels. Compared to its five constituent herbs, ChondroT exhibited the best inhibitory efficiency against osteoclastogenesis. Conclusions Taken together, ChondroT has anti osteoclastogenesis properties by inhibiting NF kappa B and MAPKs pathways. It could be considered as a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of osteoclast related bone diseases.

AB Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is an FDA approved anti parasitic drug with broad spectrum anti infective, anti inflammatory, and antineoplastic potential. However, its regulatory effects on osteoclastogenesis and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The present study found that NTZ potently inhibited osteoclast formation at the early stage of receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand induced osteoclastogenesis in a concentration dependent manner at a non growth inhibitory concentration. NTZ suppressed actin ring formation and decreased osteoclast marker gene expression, including TRAP, MMP9, and cathepsin K. NTZ significantly impaired the bone resorption activity of osteoclasts. In vivo, ovariectomized mice were treated with 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/d NTZ for 3 months. NTZ (100 mg/kg/d) administration markedly reduced ovariectomy induced bone loss by suppressing osteoclast activity. Mechanistically, osteoclastogenesis blockade elicited by NTZ resulted from inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation, and reduction of the Ca2+ fluorescence intensity and NFATc1 expression. NTZ weakened the binding between STAT3 and the NFATc1 promoter region. Furthermore, enforced NFATc1 expression partly rescued the impaired osteoclast differentiation in NTZ treated RAW264.7 cells. In summary, NTZ could inhibit osteoclastogenesis and bone loss through modulation of the receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand induced STAT3 NFATc1 signaling pathway, which might be a potential alternative treatment regimen against bone destruction related diseases including osteoporosis.

TI Repurposing of bisphosphonates for the prevention and therapy of

AB A variety of human cancers, including nonsmall cell lung (NSCLC), breast, and colon cancers, are driven by the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Having shown that bisphosphonates, a class of drugs used widely for the therapy of osteoporosis and metastatic bone disease, reduce cancer cell viability by targeting HER1, we explored their potential utility in the prevention and therapy of HER driven cancers. We show that bisphosphonates inhibit colony formation by HER1(Delta E746 A750) driven HCC827 NSCLCs and HER1(wt) expressing MB231 triple negative breast cancers, but not by HERlow SW620 colon cancers. In parallel, oral gavage with bisphosphonates of mice xenografted with HCC827 or MB231 cells led to a significant reduction in tumor volume in both treatment and prevention protocols. This result was not seen with mice harboring HERlow SW620 xenografts. We next explored whether bisphosphonates can serve as adjunctive therapies to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), namely gefitinib and erlotinib, and whether the drugs can target TKI resistant NSCLCs. In silico docking, together with molecular dynamics and anisotropic network modeling, showed that bisphosphonates bind to TKIs within the HER1 kinase domain. As predicted from this combinatorial binding, bisphosphonates enhanced the effects of TKIs in reducing cell viability and driving tumor regression in mice. Impressively, the drugs also overcame erlotinib resistance acquired through the gatekeeper mutation T790M, thus offering an option for TKI resistant NSCLCs. We suggest that bisphosphonates can potentially be repurposed for the prevention and adjunctive therapy of HER1 driven cancers.
