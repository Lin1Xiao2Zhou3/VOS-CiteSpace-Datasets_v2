AB Background Hypertrophic scars (HSs) generally form after injury to the deep layers of the dermis and are characterized by excessive collagen deposition. An increasing amount of evidence has determined that human adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells attenuate fibrosis in various conditions. We explored the effect and possible mechanism of chyle fat derived stem cells (CFSCs) on HS formation. Methods Hypertrophic scar derived fibroblasts (HSFs) and CFSCs were isolated from individual patients. Third passage CFSCs were isolated and cultured using a mechanical emulsification method, and their surface CD markers were analyzed by flow cytometry. The adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation capacity of the CFSCs was determined using oil red O staining and alizarin red S staining, respectively. Then, the effects of CFSCs on HSFs were assessed in vitro. Hypertrophic scar derived fibroblasts were treated with starvation induced conditioned medium from the CFSCs (CFSC CM). The change in HSF cellular behaviors, such as cell proliferation, migration, and protein expression of scar related molecules, was evaluated by cell counting assay, scratch wound assay, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and western blotting. All data were analyzed using SPSS 17.0. Results The CFSCs expressed CD90, CD105, and CD73 but did not express CD34, CD45, or CD31. The CFSCs differentiated into adipocytes and osteoblasts under the appropriate induction conditions. Chyle fat derived stem cells conditioned medium inhibited HSF proliferation and migration. The in vitro and ex vivo studies revealed that CFSC CM decreased type I collagen, type III collagen, and alpha smooth muscle actin expression. Conclusions Our results suggest that CFSCs are associated with the inhibition of fibrosis in HSFs by a paracrine effect. The use of CFSC CM may be a novel therapeutic strategy for HSs.

AB Aims: This study aimed to assess the beneficial effects of the concurrent administration of cilostazol and methotrexate (MTX) on the synovial fibroblasts obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and in a mouse model of collagen induced arthritis (CIA).
   Main methods: Production of TNIF alpha, IL 1 beta, IL 6 and MCP 1 on synovial fibroblasts from RA patients was determined by RT PCR. Cell proliferation, viability and apoptosis were measured. Anti arthritic effects were evaluated in CIA mice.
   Key finding: Concurrent use of cilostazol and MIX effectively suppressed proliferation and cell viability associated with enhanced apoptosis of synovial fibroblasts and significantly suppressed cytokine production, including TNF alpha, IL 1 beta, IL 6, and MCP 1 in an additive manner. In line with these findings, LPS induced increased expression of NURR1 mRNA and protein were suppressed by cilostazol and MIX in accordance with suppression of NF kappa B p65 activity. These suppressed effects were reversed by KT5720 (cAMP protein kinase inhibitor) and ZM 241385 (A(2A) receptor antagonist), respectively. In CIA mice, treatment with cilostazol, MIX and their combination significantly decreased clinical signs with improvement of histopathological status in the paw of mice, accompanied by reduced serum cytokine levels. Likewise, following concurrent administration, CD68 (+) cell recruitment, proteoglycan depletion and osteoclast formation were significantly suppressed in association with repressed RANKL expression in the joints of CIA mice.
   Significance: In conclusion, a combination of cilostazol and MIX may provide an effective therapeutic strategy for the suppression of inflammation and the prevention of joint damage in RA via activation of the cAMP dependent protein kinase in the synovial fibroblasts.

AB Background: Recent reports have documented the rate of heterotopic ossification (HO) formation in the residual limbs of combat related amputees from the US Armed Forces injured in Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom. Final amputation level within the zone of injury and blast as the mechanism of injury were identified as possible risk factors for the occurrence and grade of HO. There has been no previous description of HO in combat related amputees from the UK service personnel. The purpose of this study was to examine potential differences in the prevalence of HO between UK and US Allied Forces, with particular attention to these risk factors, patient exposures, and any treatment differences between these two groups.
   Methods: We reviewed the medical records and radiographs of 35 combat related amputations from the UK and contrasted them with 213 previously reported amputations in US military personnel. We evaluated prevalence and severity of residual limb HO, Injury Severity Score (ISS), the mechanism and zone of injury, type and level of amputation, number of debridements, method of wound irrigation, presence of severe head injury and/or burns injury, use of topical negative pressure therapy and pulse lavage, number of days until wound closure, type of closure, and subsequent infections. All patients had a minimum of 2 month posthospital discharge radiographic follow up. Comparisons were made using Fisher's exact, one way analysis of variance, and chi(2) analyses.
   Results: There was no significant difference in either the overall prevalence of HO or the prevalence of moderate to severe HO in the two populations. Twenty of 35 (57.1%) limbs in the UK amputations developed HO compared with 134 of 213 (63%) in the US amputations (p > 0.05). The UK amputations had 12 cases (34.3%) of moderate to severe HO compared with 72 cases (33.8%) in the US amputations (p > 0.05). However, there was a significant difference in the number of UK amputations 0 of 20 (0%) versus the number of US amputations 25 of 134 (12%; p = 0.04), which required excision of symptomatic lesions. There was a significant association in the development of HO in UK personnel with the use of topical negative pressure treatment (p = 0.05) and increasing ISS scores (p = 0.04) and in the development of moderate to severe HO with increasing ISS (p = 0.006) and severe HI (p = 0.04). Unlike in the previous report, no significant association was found in UK personnel between any of the remaining hypothesized risk factors and either the presence or grade of HO.
   Conclusions: Although no difference was identified in the overall prevalence of HO, there are inconsistencies in the possible underlying causes of HO between the two cohorts. Further research is required in an ongoing effort to determine a causal relationship between treatment and subsequent HO formation.

AB Integrin alpha v beta 3 is a heterodimeric structural protein of the plasma membrane that bears a cell surface receptor for thyroid hormone. The functions of this receptor are distinct from those of the classical nuclear receptor (TR) for thyroid hormone. The integrin is expressed primarily by cancer cells, dividing endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, and osteoclasts. The hormone receptor on alpha v beta 3 enables L thyroxine (T 4) and 3, 5, 3' triiodo L thyronine (T 3) to stimulate cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis and to regulate the activity of certain membrane ion pumps. Bound to the receptor, the hormone ligand also stimulates protein trafficking within the cell. A deaminated derivative of T 4, tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac), blocks binding and actions of T 4 and T 3 at the receptor on alpha v beta 3; tetrac also has anti proliferative actions at the integrin thyroid hormone receptor beyond the effects of antagonizing actions of agonist thyroid hormone analogues at the receptor. The structure activity relationships of hormone analogues at the receptor have been computer modeled and indicate that the receptor includes a site that binds T 3 and a site that binds both T 4 and T 3. Mathematical modeling of the kinetics of hormone binding also suggests the existence of two sites. Cell proliferation is modulated from the T 4/T 3 site. Tetrac has been re formulated as a nanoparticle (nanotetrac) that acts exclusively at the alpha v beta 3 receptor and does not enter cells. Nanotetrac disrupts expression of genes in multiple cancer cell survival pathways. The tetrac formulations block human cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in tumor xenografts. Nanotetrac and tetrac inhibit the pro angiogenic actions in vitro of vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast factor, and other growth factors. Thus, the receptor described on integrin alpha v beta 3 for T 4 and T 3, the function of which is materially affected by tetrac and nanotetrac, provides insight into tumor cell biology and vascular biology.

AB Background: Osteoarthritis is a severe degenerative joint disease characterized by swelling, joint pain, degradation of cartilage extracellular matrix, synovitis, callus formation, and loss of normal joint movements, which leads to functional limitations and seriously affect the patient's life quality. Objective: The current research work was focussed to synthesize and characterize the chitosansodium alginate polyethylene glycol d pinitol nanocomposites (CSP dP NCs) and evaluate its antiarthritic activity against the freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) triggered arthritis in animals. Methodology: The CSP dP NCs were synthesized by standard method. The development and properties of formulated CSP dP NCs were confirmed by several characterization techniques like UV visible, photoluminescence, X ray diffractometer (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FT IR), scanning electron microscopic (SEM), energy dispersive X ray (EDX), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses. The arthritis was induced in experimental rats via administering 0.1 ml of FCA subcutaneously and then treated with 10 and 25 mg/kg of synthesized CSP dP NCs for 25 days. The bodyweight of animals were tabulated and then haematological parameters, organ index, and paw volume was examined. The levels of liver marker enzymes were assessed by standard techniques. The contents and pro inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant parameters were quantified using assay kits. Results: The findings of characterization studies confirmed the development of CSP dP NCs with size ranging from 180 nm, tetragonal appearance, and narrowed distribution. The CSP dPNCs treated arthritic animals demonstrated the improved bodyweight and haematological parameters. The levels of thymus and spleen index and hind paw volume was decreased by the CSP dPNCs. The administration of CSP dP NCs to the arthritic rats also exhibited the decreased contents of IL 6, IL 10, IL 1b, TNF a, MDA levels and increased the GSH level, CAT and SOD activities. The activities of ALP, ALT, and ASP also decreased in arthritic rats by the CSP dP NCs treatment. Conclusion: Altogether, the findings of this study demonstrated the antiarthritic activity of formulated CSP dP NCs against FCA induced arthritic rats via modulating oxidative stress and inflammatory parameters. Hence, it could be the effective drug for the arthritis treatment in the (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

AB Severe aortic stenosis (AS) is prevalent in adults >= 65 years, a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, with no medical therapy. Lipid and proteomic alterations of human AS tissue were determined using mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC ESI MS/MS) to understand histopathology, potential biomarkers of disease, and progression from non calcified to calcified phenotype. A reproducible MSI method was developed using healthy murine aortic valves (n = 3) and subsequently applied to human AS (n = 2). Relative lipid levels were spatially mapped and associated with different microdomains. Proteomics for non calcified and calcified microdomains were performed to ascertain differences in expression. Increased pro osteogenic and inflammatory lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) 16:0 and 18:0 were co localized with calcified microdomains. Proteomics analysis identified differential patterns in calcified microdomains with high LPC and low cholesterol as compared to non calcified microdomains with low LPC and high cholesterol. Calcified microdomains had higher levels of: apolipoproteins (Apo) B 100 (p < 0.001) and Apo A IV (p < 0.001), complement C3 and C4 B (p < 0.001), C5 (p = 0.007), C8 beta chain (p = 0.013) and C9 (p = 0.010), antithrombotic proteins alpha 2 macroglobulin (p < 0.0001) and antithrombin III (p = 0.002), and higher anti calcific fetuin A (p = 0.02), while the osteoblast differentiating factor transgelin (p < 0.0001), extracellular matrix proteins versican, prolargin, and lumican ( p < 0.001) and regulator protein complement factor H (p < 0.001) were higher in non calcified microdomains. A combined lipidomic and proteomic approach provided insight into factors potentially contributing to progression from non calcified to calcific disease in severe AS. Additional studies of these candidates and protein networks could yield new targets for slowing progression of AS.

AB As local gene therapy has received attention, immobilizing functional gene onto irregular oral implant surface has become an advanced challenge. Electrostatic layer by layer (LBL) assembly technique could achieve this goal and allow local and efficient administration of genes to the target cells. In this study, multilayers of cationic lipid/plasmid DNA (pEGFP C1) complex (LDc) and anionic hyaluronic acid were assembled onto sandblasted dual acid etched titanium disks by the LBL technique. Surface characteristics of the coatings were performed by x ray photospectroscopy (XPS), contact angle measurements, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The cell biological characteristics of the coatings were evaluated by in vitro experiments. SEM results demonstrated that the porous titanium surface was gradually flattened with the increase of the multilayer. The XPS survey indicated that the N element was found from the coating. The coating degradation and pEGFP C1 releasing kinetics showed that the more assembled layer numbers were, the larger the amount of DNA released in the first 30 h. MC3T3 E1 cells were cultured directly on the DNA loaded surface. Higher enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression efficiency was achieved by increasing the number of layers when cells were cultured after 24 or 72 h. The MC3T3 E1 cell viability on the surface of multilayer DNA coatings was significantly higher than that on control porous titanium surface. It was concluded that the approach established by the LBL technique had great potential in immobilizing gene coatings onto the porous titanium surface and subsequently influenced the function of the cultured cell.

AB Biomedical associated infections (BAI) are difficult to treat and may even lead to amputation and death, especially after the emergence of drug resistant bacteria. The aim of this study was to harness the potential synergistic effects of multiple bactericidal agents to endow polyetheretherketone (PEEK) with the ability of achieving full eradication of planktonic and adherent bacteria while maintaining acceptable biocompatibility. In this work, a mussel inspired, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) incorporated silk fibroin (SF)/gentamicin sulfate (GS) coating was constructed upon porous PEEK surface. The obtained coating greatly enhanced the bactericidal efficiency to Gram positive bacteria and Gram negative bacteria. The number of bacteria survived in the culture medium after treated with this coating was 10(6) fold lower than that survived after treated with PEEK sample, while the number of viable bacteria adhered to this coating was 10(5) lower than that adhered to PEEK sample. Furthermore, release of Ag+ and GS increased with decreasing pH, indicating great potential of this coating to be a "smart" bacteria triggered self defensive coating. Meanwhile, this functional coating shows favorable cytocompatibility and osteogenic ability. The mechanism behind this dual function is also partially revealed. Expectedly, this "smart" dual function coating can give a promise for PEEK to become a solution to increasingly deteriorated BAI.
   Statement of Significance
   In this study, a mussel inspired, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) incorporated silk fibroin (SF)/gentamicin sulfate (GS) coating was constructed upon porous polyetheretherketone (PEEK) surface. This design was aimed to provide a solution to the increasingly deteriorated biomedical associated infections (BAI). Actually, this design endowed PEEK with dual function: bacteria triggered synergistic bactericidal effect and improved osteogenic ability. The combination of silver and GS exhibited synergistic bacteria killing effect on both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, which showed 10(6) times higher in releasing killing and 105 times higher in anti adhesion than that of untreated PEEK. Furthermore, release of bactericidal agents increased with decreasing pH, indicating great potential of this coating to be a bacteria triggered self defensive coating. More interestingly, this study revealed the mechanism of synergistic effect between silver and GS. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Aortic valve stenosis (AS) disease is the most common valvular disease in developed countries. The pathology of AS is complex, and its main processes include calcification of the valve stroma and involve genetic factors, lipoprotein deposition and oxidation, chronic inflammation, osteogenic transition of cardiac valve interstitial cells, and active valve calcification. The aim of this study was to identify potential genes associated with AS. Methods: Three original gene expression profiles (GSE153555, GSE12644, and GSE51472) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and analyzed by GEO2R tool or 'limma' in R to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional enrichment was analyzed using the ClusterProfiler package in R Bioconductor. STRING was utilized for the Protein Protein Interaction (PPI) Network construct, and tissue specific gene expression were identified using BioGPS database. The hub genes were screened out using the Cytoscape software. Related miRNAs were predicted in Targetscan, miWalk, miRDB, Hoctar, and TarBase. Results: A total of 58 upregulated genes and 20 downregulated genes were screened out, which were mostly enriched in matrix remodeling and the immune system process. A module was thus clustered into by PPI network analysis, which mainly involved in Fc gamma R mediated phagocytosis, Osteoclast differentiation. Ten genes (IBSP, NCAM1, MMP9, FCGR3B, COL4A3, FCGR1A, THY1, RUNX2, ITGA4, and COL10A1) with the highest degree scores were subsequently identified as the hub genes for AS by applying the CytoHubba plugin. And hsa miR 1276 was finally identified as potential miRNA and miRNA gene regulatory network was constructed using NetworkAnalyst. Conclusions: Our analysis suggested that IBSP, NCAM1, MMP9, FCGR3B, COL4A3, FCGR1A, THY1, RUNX2, ITGA4, and COL10A1 might be hub genes associated with AS, and hsa miR 1276 was potential miRNA. This result could provide novel insight into pathology and therapy of AS in the future.

AB The perivascular epithelioid cell (PEC) is a unique cell type coexpressing contractile proteins (mainly alpha smooth muscle actin), melanocytic markers, including microphthalmia associated transcription factor (MITF), and estrogen and progesterone receptors. It is constantly present in a group of tumors called PEComas. Renal PEComas include the common angiomyolipoma as well as less common lesions such as microscopic angiomyolipoma, intraglomerular lesions, angiomyolipoma with epithelial cysts, epithelioid angiomyolipoma, oncocytoma like angiomyolipoma and lymphangioleiomyomatosis of the renal sinus. It has been demonstrated that most of these lesions are determined by mutations affecting genes of the tuberous sclerosis complex, tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1) and tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2), with eventual deregulation of the RHEB/MTOR/RPS6KB2 pathway, and it has been observed that some PEComas regressed during sirolimus therapy, an MTOR inhibitor. Recently, overexpression of MITF has been related to the expression of the papain like cysteine protease cathepsin K in osteoclasts where it has inhibited MTOR. The aim of this study is to evaluate cathepsin K immunohistochemically in the entire spectrum of PEComa lesions in the kidney. The study population consisted of 84 renal PEComa lesions, including 5 composed predominantly of fat (lipoma like angiomyolipoma), 15 almost exclusively composed of spindle shaped smooth muscle cells (leiomyoma like angiomyolipoma) and 31 common angiomyolipomas composed of a mixture of fat, spindle and epithelioid smooth muscle cells, and abnormal thick walled blood vessels, 15 microscopic angiomyolipomas, 5 intraglomerular lesions, 2 oncocytoma like angiomyolipomas, 8 epithelioid angiomyolipomas, 2 angiomyolipomas with epithelial cysts and 1 example of lymphangioleiomyomatosis of the renal sinus. In all of the renal PEComas, cathepsin K was found to be constantly and strongly expressed and seems to be a more powerful marker than other commonly used markers for their identification, especially to confirm the diagnosis on needle biopsies.

AB Objective: This study aimed to investigate the differences and inhibitory effects of diethyl citrate (Et(2)Cit), sodium citrate (Na(3)Cit), and phosphonoformic acid (PFA) on calcification induced by high inorganic phosphate (Pi) contents in mouse aortic smooth muscle cells (MOVAS) and to develop drugs that can induce anticoagulation and inhibit vascular calcification (VC).
   Methods: Alive and fixed MOVAS were assessed for 14 days in the presence of high Pi with increasing Et(2)Cit, Na(3)Cit, and PFA concentrations. Calcification on MOVAS was measured through Alizarin red staining and the deposited calcium amount; apoptosis was detected by annexin V staining; and cell transdifferentiation was examined by measuring smooth muscle lineage gene (alpha SMA) expression and alkaline phosphatase activity.
   Results: Coincubation of MOVAS with Et(2)Cit, Na(3)Cit, and PFA significantly decreased Pi induced VC in live MOVAS, and the apoptotic rate was reduced by low inhibitor concentrations. The 3 inhibitors could prevent the alkaline phosphatase activity induced by high Pi contents and increased the expression of a smooth muscle actin genes. Thus, the transdifferentiation of MOVAS into osteoblast like cells was blocked. Their inhibitory effects exhibited concentration dependence. The inhibitory effect of each inhibitor at the same concentration showed the following trend: PFA. Na(3)Cit. Et(2)Cit.
   Conclusions: Et(2)Cit, Na(3)Cit, and PFA prevented the calcification of MOVAS and inhibited the osteochondrocytic conversion of vascular smooth muscle cells. Thus, Et(2)Cit and Na(3)Cit as anticoagulants may alleviate VC in clinical applications.

AB Objective Overexpression of tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) in endothelium leads to arterial calcification in mice. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of elevated endothelial TNAP on coronary atherosclerosis. In addition, we aimed to examine endogenous TNAP activity in human myocardium.
   Approach and results A vascular pattern of TNAP activity was observed in human non failing, ischemic, and idiopathic dilated hearts (5 per group); no differences were noted between groups in this study. Endothelial overexpression of TNAP was achieved in mice harboring a homozygous recessive mutation in the low density lipoprotein receptor (whc allele) utilizing a Tie2 cre recombinase (WHC eTNAP mice). WHC eTNAP developed significant coronary artery calcification at baseline compared WHC controls (4312 vs 0 mu m(2) alizarin red area, p< 0.001). Eight weeks after induction of atherosclerosis, lipid deposition in the coronary arteries of WHC eTNAP was increased compared to WHC controls (121633 vs 9330 mu m(2) oil red O area, p<0.05). Coronary lesions in WHC eTNAP mice exhibited intimal thickening, calcifications, foam cells, and necrotic cores. This was accompanied by the reduction in body weight and left ventricular ejection fraction (19.5 vs. 23.6g, p<0.01; 35% vs. 47%, p<0.05). In a placebo controlled experiment under atherogenic conditions, pharmacological inhibition of TNAP in WHC eTNAP mice by a specific inhibitor SBI 425 (30mg*kg( 1)*d( 1), for 5 weeks) reduced coronary calcium (78838 vs. 144622 mu m(2)) and lipids (30754 vs. 77317 mu m(2)); improved body weight (22.4 vs. 18.8g) and ejection fraction (59 vs. 47%). The effects of SBI 425 were significant in the direct comparisons with placebo but disappeared after TNAP negative placebo treated group was included in the models as healthy controls.
   Conclusions Endogenous TNAP activity is present in human cardiac tissues. TNAP overexpression in vascular endothelium in mice leads to an unusual course of coronary atherosclerosis, in which calcification precedes lipid deposition. The prevalence and significance of this mechanism in human atherosclerosis requires further investigations.

AB Sa12b is a wasp peptide that can inhibit acid sensitive ion channels (ASICs). The biological effects of nucleus pulposus mesenchymal stem cells (NP MSCs) have not been investigated. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of Sa12b on the biological activity of NP MSCs through ASICs in the acidic environment of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). In this study, NP MSCs were isolated from the nucleus pulposus (NP) in patients who underwent lumbar disc herniation surgery, identified by flow cytometry and tertiary differentiation, and cultured in vitro in an acidic environment model of IVDD with a pH of 6.2. Proliferation, and apoptosis were observed after different Sa12b concentrations were added to P2 generation NP MSCs. The Ca2+ influx was detected using flow cytometry and laser confocal scanning microscopy, and qPCR was used to detect the relative expression of stem cell associated genes (Oct4, Nanog, Jag1, and Notch1), the relative expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) associated genes (collagen II, aggrecan, and SOX 9), and the relative expression of genes encoding ASICs (ASIC1, ASIC2, ASIC3, and ASIC4). Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression of collagen II and aggrecan in different treatment groups. Cells isolated and cultured from normal NP were spindle shaped and adherent, and they exhibited expansion in vitro. Flow cytometry results showed that the cells exhibited high expression of CD73 (98.1%), CD90 (97.5%), and CD105 (98.3%) and low expression of HLA DR (0.93%), CD34 (2.63%), and CD45 (0.33%). The cells differentiated into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. According to the International Society for Cellular Therapy criteria, the isolated and cultured cells were NP MSCs. With an increase in Sa12b concentration, the cell proliferation rate of NP MSCs increased, and the apoptosis rate decreased significantly, reaching the optimal level when the concentration of Sa12b was 8 mu g/mu l. When the Sa12b concentration was 8 mu g/mu l and contained the ASIC non specific inhibitor amiloride, the Ca2+ influx was the lowest, followed by that when the Sa12b concentration was 8 mu g/mu l. The Ca2+ influx was the highest in the untreated control group. qPCR results showed that as the concentration of Sa12b increased, the relative expression of Oct4, Nanog, Jag1, Notch1, collagen II, aggrecan, and SOX 9 increased, while that of ASIC1, ASIC2, ASIC3, and ASIC4 decreased. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). In conclusion, Sa12b can improve the biological activity of NP MSCs in severely acidic environments of the intervertebral disc by reducing Ca2+ influx via AISC inhibition and, probably, the Notch signaling pathway. This study provides a new approach for the biological treatment of IVDD. Inhibition of AISCs by Sa12b may delay IVDD and improve low back pain.

AB Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is characterized by a fibrocalcific process. The regulatory mechanisms that drive the fibrotic response in the aortic valve (AV) are poorly understood. Long noncoding RNAs derived from super enhancers (lncRNA SE) control gene expression and cell fate. Herein, multidimensional profiling including chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing, transposase accessible chromatin sequencing, genome wide 3D chromatin contacts of enhancer promoter identified LINC01013 as an overexpressed lncRNA SE during CAVD. LINC01013 is within a loop anchor, which has contact with the promoter of CCN2 (CTGF) located at similar to 180 kb upstream. Investigation showed that LINC01013 acts as a decoy factor for the negative transcription elongation factor E (NELF E), whereby it controls the expression of CCN2. LINC01013 CCN2 is part of a transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) network and exerts a control over fibrogenesis. These findings illustrate a novel mechanism whereby a dysregulated lncRNA SE controls, through a looping process, the expression of CCN2 and fibrogenesis of the AV.
   Author summary
   Calcific aortic valve disease is the most common heart valve disorder characterized by a thickening of the aortic valve resulting from fibrotic and calcific processes. Because the aortic valve replacement is currently the only therapeutic option, the identification of key molecular processes that control the progression of the disease could lead to the development of novel noninvasive therapies. Growing evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) fine tune gene expression in health and disease states. By using a multidimensional profiling including genome wide 3D enhancer promoter looping data, we identified LINC01013, a lncRNA, as a regulator of fibrogenesis. Specifically, we found that LINC01013 is located in a cluster of distant enhancers (super enhancer) in aortic valve interstitial cells and has significant long range looping with the promoter of CCN2, a gene that orchestrates fibrogenesis. We discovered that LINC01013 is acting as a decoy factor for a negative transcription elongation factor, whereby it controls the transcription of CCN2. In turn, higher expression of LINC01013 during calcific aortic valve disease promoted the expression of CCN2 and a fibrogenic program. These findings provide evidence that LINC01013 is a key regulator of fibrogenesis in CAVD.

AB As the most abundant infiltrating immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are pivotal in tumor development and treatment. The present investigation endeavors to explore the potential of M1 macrophage related genes (MRGs) as biomarkers for assessing risk in individuals with osteosarcoma. RNA sequence data and clinical data were derived from TCGA and GEO databases. The CIBERSORT method was utilized to discern subtypes of tumor infiltrating immune cells. Identification of MRGs was achieved through Pearson correlation analysis. A prognostic risk model for MRGs was developed using Cox and LASSO regression analyses. A tripartite gene signature comprising CD37, GABRD, and ARHGAP25 was an independent prognostic indicator and was employed to develop a risk score model. The internal and external validation cohort confirmed the results. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was determined for survival periods of 1 year, three years, and five years, yielding values of 0.746, 0.839, and 0.850, respectively. The C index of the risk score was found to be superior to clinicopathological factors. GO/KEGG enrichment showed that the differences between high  and low risk groups were predominantly associated with immune response pathways. Immune related analysis related to proportions of immune cells, immune function, and expression levels of immune checkpoint genes all showed differences between the high  and low risk groups. The qRT PCR and Western blotting results indicate that CD37 expression was markedly higher in MG63 and U2OS cell lines when compared to normal osteoblast hFOB1.19. In U2OS cell line, GABRD expression levels were significantly upregulated. ARHGAP25 expression levels were elevated in both 143B and U2OS cell lines. In summary, utilizing a macrophage genes signature demonstrates efficacy in predicting both the prognosis and therapy response of OS. Additionally, immune analysis confirms a correlation between the risk score and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings, therefore, provide a cogent account for the disparate prognoses observed among patients and furnish a justification for further inquiry into biomarkers and anti tumor treatment strategies.

AB ObjectiveTo investigate the effect of nasal mucosa derived ectodermal mesenchymal stem cells (NM EMSCs) on the inflammatory state of rats with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and the underlying therapeutic mechanism.MethodsNM EMSCs were isolated and extracted to construct a rat model of CRS. Fifteen Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups: CK + NS group rats were injected locally with saline in the nasal mucosa; CRS + NS group rats were injected locally with saline in the nasal mucosa; and CRS + EMSCs group rats were injected locally with NM EMSCs in the nasal mucosa. One rat from the CRS + EMSCs group was randomly euthanized at 2, 4, and 6 days after injection, and the nasal mucosa tissues were collected for HE staining, Masson's trichrome staining, and periodic acid Schiff staining.ResultsNM EMSCs specifically expressing CD73, CD105, and CD90 were successfully isolated from the nasal mucosa of rats and were able to differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes. After saline and NM EMSC injection, compared with those in the blank control CK + NS group, the nasal mucosa in the CRS + NS and CRS + EMSC groups exhibited obvious thickening, a large amount of inflammatory cell infiltration, and increased collagen and mucin distribution. Four days post NM EMSC injection, the thickening of the nasal mucosa in the CRS group was gradually alleviated, the inflammatory cell infiltration gradually decreased, and the distribution of collagen and mucin and the collagen positive area gradually decreased. Moreover, only a small number of inflammatory cells were visible, and the distribution of mucins was limited to 6 days post NM EMSC injection.ConclusionNM EMSCs effectively attenuated inflammation in the nasal mucosa of CRS model rats.
   We successfully obtained rat nasal mucosa derived ectodermal mesenchymal stem cells and found that they could ameliorate chronic sinusitis in rats. image

AB Background: Control of 3D printing of highly tough hydrogel inks with adequate printability, scaffold fidelity and mechanical properties are highly desirable for biomedical and tissue engineering applications. However, developing a biocompatible tough ink with high resolution printability, biodegradability, self healing, adhesion, and integration with surrounding tissues is a big challenge in 3D printing. The aim of this study was to develop extrusion based 3D printing of viscous hydrogel composing of maleic acid and propylene diepoxide by controlling continuous mechanisms of condensation and radical polymerization.Methods: The molecular weight of highly adhesive propagating poly(malate co propylene oxide) copolymer was controlled by capping its growing chain with mono functional lipoic acid with different compositions during condensation reaction to form lipoic acid capped gel (LP capped gel). Poly(ethylene oxide) diacrylate, PEGDA, is graft polymerized to the LP capped backbone polymer (MPLE gel) by UV irradiation during 3D printing process to control the properties of gel printability, mechanical properties, and cell adhesiveness and post printing fidelity of the printed scaffolds with high resolution and mechanical properties (MPLE scaffold). The scaffolds in complex geometries have been printed out in diverse forms with addition of model drugs with different molecular weights and chemical structures. Both the highly adhesive LP capped gel and printing controlled MPLE gel/scaffolds are diversely characterized and compared with for their applications to the extrusion based printability, including biocompatibility, self healing, drug releasing, adhesiveness, multi layered high resolution printing. Further in vitro/in vivo tests were done to observe cytotoxicity, immune response and tissue formation by using different cells in mice model.Results: LP capped hydrogel from maleic acid and propylene diepoxide gel showed control of gel properties with lipoic acid with one function group of thiol during condensation reaction, and the ratio at 1:0.3 (w/v) between LP capped gel and PEGDA was chosen for the optimal results during radical polymerization process for 3D printing at high resolution (90 140 mu m in strut thickness) with various complex geometries (lattice, rhombus, and honeycomb). The hydrogel showed excellent properties of self healing, mechanical strength, biocompatibility, etc. In addition, the long term release profiles of bioactive molecules were well controlled by incorporating drugs of high molecular bovine serum albumin (BSA, 21 days, 98.4 +/  0.69%), or small molecule ornidazole (ORN, 14 days, 97.1 +/  1.98%) into the MPLE gel scaffolds for the tests of potential therapeutic applications. More importantly, the MPLE gels represents excellent in vitro cyto compatibility against osteoblast like cells (MC3T3) with viability value at 96.43% +/  7.48% over 7 culturing days. For in vivo studies, the flexible MPLE scaffolds showed significant improvement on angiogenesis with minor inflammatory response after 4 week implantation in mice.Conclusion: The MPLE gel inks was well controlled for the fabrication of flexible complex tissue engineering scaffold with high resolutions, shear thinning, 3D printability and post printing fidelity, by modulating the composition of the highly adhesive LP capped gel and inert PEGDA as well as end capping of lipoic acid to the propagating poly(malate co propylene oxide) copolymer.
   The gel ink demonstrated its excellent printability, in vitro/in vivo biocompatibility and mechanical properties as well as sustained drug release from the gel.

AB Objective. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of canine umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC MSCs) on the treatment of knee osteoarthritis in dogs. Methods. Eight dogs were evenly assigned to two groups. The canine model of knee osteoarthritis was established by surgical manipulation of knee articular cartilage on these eight dogs. UC MSCs were isolated from umbilical cord Wharton's jelly by 0.1% type collagenase I and identified by immunofluorescence staining and adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation in vitro. A suspension of allogeneic UC MSCs (1 x 10(6)) and an equal amount of physiological saline was injected into the cavitas articularis in the treated and untreated control groups, respectively, on days 1 and 3 posttreatment. The structure of the canine knee joint was observed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), B mode ultrasonography, and X ray imaging at the 3rd, 7th, 14th, and 28th days after treatment. Concurrently, the levels of IL 6, IL 7, and TNF alpha in the blood of the examined dogs were measured. Moreover, the recovery of cartilage and patella surface in the treated group and untreated group was compared using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) after a 35 day treatment. Results. Results revealed that the isolated cells were UC MSCs, because they were positive for CD44 and negative for CD34 surface markers, and the cells were differentiated into adipocytes and osteoblasts. Imaging technology showed that as treatment time increased, the high signal in the MRI T2 weighted images decreased, the echo free space in B ultrasonography images disappeared basically, and the continuous linear hypoechoic region at the trochlear sulcus thickened. On X ray images, the serrate defect at the ventral cortex of the patella improved, and the low density gap of the ventral patella and trochlear crest gradually increased in the treated group. On the contrary, the high signal in the MRI T2 weighted images and the echo free space in B ultrasonography images still increased after a 14 day treatment in the untreated control group, and the linear hypoechoic region was discontinuous. On the X ray images, there was no improvement in the serrate defect of the ventral cortex of the patella. Results for inflammatory factors showed that the blood levels of IL 6, IL 7, and TNF alpha of the untreated control group were significantly higher than those of the treated group (P < 0 05) 7 14 days posttreatment. The result of SEM showed that the cartilage neogenesis in the treated group had visible neonatal tissue and more irregular arrangement of new tissue fibers than that of the untreated control group. Furthermore, more vacuoles but without collagen fibers were observed in the cartilage of the untreated control group, and the thickness of the neogenetic cartilage in the treated group (65.13 +/  5.29, 65.30 +/  5.83) and the untreated control group (34.27 +/  5.42) showed a significant difference (P < 0 01). Conclusion. Significantly higher improvement in cartilage neogenesis and recovery was observed in the treated group compared to the untreated control group. The joint fluid and the inflammatory response in the treated group decreased. Moreover, improved recovery in the neogenetic cartilage, damaged skin fascia, and muscle tissue around the joints was more significant in the treated group than in the untreated control group.
   In conclusion, canine UC MSCs promote the repair of cartilage and patella injury in osteoarthritis, improve the healing of the surrounding tissues, and reduce the inflammatory response.

AB Ferric hydroxyapatites (Fe HAp) and oxyapatites (Fe OAp) of nominal composition [Ca10 xFex3+][(PO4)(6)][(OH)(2 x)O x] (0 <= x <= 0.5) were synthesized from a coprecipitated precursor calcined under flowing nitrogen. The solid solubility of iron was temperature dependent, varying from x = 0.5 after firing at 600 degrees C to x similar to 0.2 at 1000 degrees C, beyond which Fe OAp was progressively replaced by tricalcium phosphate (Fe TCP). Crystal size (13 116 nm) was controlled by iron content and calcination temperature. Ferric iron replaces calcium by two altervalent mechanisms in which carbonate and oxygen are incorporated as counterions. At low iron loadings, carbonate predominantly displaces hydroxyl in the apatite channels (Ca2+ + OH   > Fe3+ + CO32 ), while at higher loadings, "interstitial" oxygen is tenanted in the framework (2Ca(2+) + square(vac)  > 2Fe(3+) + O2+). Although Fell is smaller than Ca2+, the unit cell dilates as iron enters apatite, providing evidence of oxygen injection that converts PO4 tetrahedra to PO5 trigonal bipyramids, leading to the crystal chemical formula [Ca10 xFex][(PO4)(6 xl2)(PO5)(xl2)][(OH)(2 y)O 2y] (x <= 0.5). A discontinuity in unit cell expansion at x   0.2 combined with a substantial reduction of the carbonate FTIR fingerprint shows that oxygen infusion, rather than tunnel hydroxyl displacement, is dominant beyond this loading. This behavior is in contrast to ferrous fluorapatite where Ca2+  > Fe2+ aliovalent replacement does not require oxygen penetration and the cell volume contracts with iron loading. All of the materials were paramagnetic, but at low iron concentrations, a transition arising from crystallographic modification or a change in spin ordering is observed at 90 K. The excipient behavior of Fe OAp was superior to that of HAp and may be linked to the crystalline component or mediated by a ubiquitous nondiffracting amorphous phase. Fe HAp and Fe OAp are not intrinsically suitable magnetic agents for drug delivery but may be useful in reactive cements that promote osteoblast proliferation.

AB Chronic non healing wounds represent one of the most common complications of diabetes and need advanced treatment strategies. Exosomes are key mediators of cell paracrine action and can be directly utilized as therapeutic agents for tissue repair and regeneration. Here, we explored the effects of exosomes from human urine derived stem cells (USC Exos) on diabetic wound healing and the underlying mechanism.
   Methods: USCs were characterized by flow cytometry and multipotent differentiation potential analyses. USC Exos were isolated from the conditioned media of USCs and identified by transmission electron microscopy and flow cytometry. A series of functional assays in vitro were performed to assess the effects of USC Exos on the activities of wound healing related cells. Protein profiles in USC Exos and USCs were examined to screen the candidate molecules that mediate USC Exos function. The effects of USC Exos on wound healing in streptozotocin induced diabetic mice were tested by measuring wound closure rates, histological and immunofluorescence analyses. Meanwhile, the role of the candidate protein in USC Exos induced regulation of angiogenic activities of endothelial cells and diabetic wound healing was assessed.
   Results: USCs were positive for CD29, CD44, CD73 and CD90, but negative for CD34 and CD45. USCs were able to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes. USC Exos exhibited a cup or sphere shaped morphology with a mean diameter of 51.57 +/  2.93 nm and positive for CD63 and TSG101. USC Exos could augment the functional properties of wound healing related cells including the angiogenic activities of endothelial cells. USC Exos were enriched in the proteins that are involved in regulation of wound healing related biological processes. Particularly, a pro angiogenic protein called deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 (DMBT1) was highly expressed in USC Exos. Further functional assays showed that DMBT1 protein was required for USC Exos induced promotion of angiogenic responses of cultured endothelial cells, as well as angiogenesis and wound healing in diabetic mice.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that USC Exos may represent a promising strategy for diabetic soft tissue wound healing by promoting angiogenesis via transferring DMBT1 protein.

AB Recent findings suggest that cell and gene transplantation in the infarcted myocardium may improve heart function. The aim of the study was to investigate the mechanism involved in improving heart function following the co injection of adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in a rat model of myocardial infarction. In this study, ADSCs were isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissues. The ADSCs were induced to differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts and cardiac myocytes in vitro. bFGF was co injected with the ADSCs into the left ventricular wall in a rat myocardial infarction model. The structural and functional outcomes resulting from this transplantation were determined through detailed histological analysis and echocardiography. The graft size was significantly larger in the bFGF + ADSC group than in the PBS + ADSC group and PBS + bFGF group 4 weeks after injection (p < 0.05). The ADSCs were able to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo. There was a significant improvement in arteriole density within the infarcted area in the bFGF + ADSC group compared with the PBS + ADSC group and the PBS + bFGF group 4 weeks after transplantation (p < 0.05). The results of Western blot analysis showed that all of the treatments significantly reduced MMP2 and MMP9 protein levels compared with the PBS control group (p < 0.05) and that the levels of these proteins displayed the largest decrease in the bFGF + ADSC group (p < 0.05). In addition, the results of a quantitative analysis revealed that the proportion of fibrotic areas was significantly lower in the PBS + ADSC and bFGF + ADSC groups compared with the PBS only group and PBS + bFGF group (p < 0.05). The combined application of bFGF and ADSC transplantation may significantly increase the number of arterioles, reduce the infarcted size, attenuate ventricular remodeling and improve cardiac function. This ADSC + bFGF treatment strategy (or a variation thereof) may prove to be broadly applicable to other candidate cell preparations used in regenerative medicine.

AB dIn the present study, we examined whether mildly altering dietary cation anion difference (DCAD) contributes to the prevention of milk fever in dairy cows. Thirty multiparous cows and ten primiparous cows (heifer group) were used in this study and the multiparous cows were randomly divided into three groups of ten animals each (anion, non anion and control groups). The cows in the anion group were given supplemental salts that slightly lowered DCAD. These salts consisted of 115 g of CaCO3, 42 g of CaHPO4, 65 g of MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O and 80 g of CaCl2 center dot 2H(2)O as a daily dose for each cow, using a catheter from 21 days before the expected date of parturition until parturition. The cows in the non anion group were given only the same Ca, Mg and ip supplement but no sulfate and chloride salts as that in the anion group. The cows in the control and heifer groups were not given any additional supplement. The incidence of hypocalcemia in the anion group decreased to approximately half of those in the non anion and control groups, while the heifer group did not develop hypocalcemia at all. In addition, the number of days spent for the treatment of hypocalcernia and the number of drug bottles (calcium borogluconate solution) used for the treatment decreased to less than half in the anion group compared with those in the nonanion and control groups. At parturition, the serum Ca concentration in the control (6.2 +/  1.9 mg/dl, mean standard deviation) and non anion groups (6.4 +/  1.7 mg/dl) were significantly lower than that in the heifer group (8.3 +/  0.4 mg/dl), and the level in the anion group was intermediate (7.3 +/  1.3 mg/dl). The change in ionized Ca concentration was almost the same as that in serum Ca concentration, but only the concentration in the anion group tended to increase slightly from a week before parturition and was significantly higher than that in all other groups three days before parturition. Urinary pH in the anion group was maintained at a mildly acidic level (6.8 7.0) for the last two weeks before parturition, compared with those in the control (7.3 7.5) and non anion groups (7.9 8.1), and similar to that in the heifer group (6.3 7.3). The urinary Ca excretion was the highest in the anion group among all groups during the prepartum period. There were no specific changes in the excretion of parathyroid hormone and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D in all groups of multiparous cows while the levels of these hormones remained low in the heifer group throughout the experimental period. The data in the present study indicates that the administration of anion salts that slightly lowered DCAD in the preparum period was effective for preventing milk fever in multiparous cows. Safe and mild metabolic acidosis induced by the anion salts could be evaluated by urinary pH (6.8 7.0), and might increase the responsiveness to Ca requirement at parturition through some complex mechanisms unrelated to the excretion of Ca related hormones. In addition, it was clarified that primiparous cows have a high potential to respond to sudden Ca demand unrelated to hormone excretion, and their Ca metabolism was in some respects similar to that in multiparous cows fed anion salts. Therefore, manipulating mildly DCAD is expected to be an effective, safe and natural method for preventing milk fever in dairy cows.

AB Background: Although disease in a majority of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients is often initially limited to one or a few joints, currently approved medications including anti tumor necrosis factor alpha antibody (alpha TNF) are injected systemically. Given that alpha TNF systemic injection typically does not cure RA and involves risk of treatment related adverse events, one possible approach to enhance therapeutic efficacy and reduce alpha TNF systemic exposure is to retain the antibodies in arthritic joints after local administration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the approach of conferring extracellular matrix (ECM) binding affinity to alpha TNF antibodies in a RA model.
   Methods: alpha TNF was chemically conjugated with a promiscuous ECM binding peptide derived from placenta growth factor 2 (PlGF 2(123 144)). The binding activity of PlGF 2(123 144) conjugated alpha TNF (PlGF 2(123 144) alpha TNF) against ECM proteins was assessed by ELISA and by immunostaining on human cartilage specimens. The effect of conjugation on antibody function was assessed as a neutralizing activity against osteoclast differentiation. Retention at the injection site and therapeutic efficacy of PlGF 2(123 144) alpha TNF were tested in a collagen antibody induced arthritis (CAIA) model in the mouse.
   Results: PlGF 2(123 144) peptide conjugation conferred a TNF with affinity to ECM proteins without impairment of antigen recognition. PlGF 2(123 144) alpha TNF locally injected at a paw in the CAIA model was retained for at least 96 h at the injection site, whereas unmodified alpha TNF was dispersed rapidly after injection. Local treatment with unmodified alpha TNF did not suppress the arthritis score relative to isotype controls. By contrast, local administration of PlGF 2(123 144) alpha TNF suppressed arthritis development almost completely in the treated paw even at a 1000x lower dose.
   Conclusion: These data demonstrate that retention of alpha TNF in arthritic joints can suppress arthritis development and enhance therapeutic efficacy. This simple bioengineering approach of ECM binding peptide conjugation offers a powerful and clinically translational approach to treat RA.

AB Bioactive glass (BG) occupies a significant position in the field of hard and soft tissue regeneration. Different processing techniques and formulas have been introduced to expand their regenerative, angiogenic, and antibacterial properties. In the present study, a new formula of bborosilicate bioactive glass nanofibers was prepared and tested for its wound healing efficacy in a rabbit animal model. The glass formula ((1 2) mol% of B2O3 (68 69) mol% of SiO2, and (29 30) mol% of CaO) was prepared primarily by the sol gel technique followed by the electrospinning technique. The material was characterized for its ultrastructure using scanning electron microscopy, chemical composition using FTIR, and its dynamic in vitro biodegradability using ICP AES. Twelve rabbits were subjected to surgical induction of full thickness skin defects using a 1 cm(2) custom made stainlessteel skin punch. The bioactive glass nanofibers were used as a grafting material in 6 experimental rabbits, while the defects in the remaining rabbits were considered as the negative control samples. All defects were assessed clinically for the decrease in wound size and clinical signs of healing and histologically for angiogenesis, collagen density, inflammatory response, cell recruitment, epithelial lining, and appendages at 1,2 and 3 weeks following the intervention. Structural analysis of the glass fibers confirmed their nano size which ranged from 150 to 700 nm. Moreover, the chemical analysis confirmed the presence of SiO2 and B2O3 groups within the structure of the nanofibers. Additionally, dynamic biodegradation analysis confirmed the rapid degradation of the material starting from the first 24 h and rapid leaching of calcium, silicon, and boron ions confirming its bioactivity. The wound healing study of the nanofibrous scaffold confirmed its ability to accelerate wound healing and the closure rate in healthy rabbits. Histological analysis of the defects confirmed the angiogenic, regenerative and antibacterial ability of the material throughout the study period. The results unveil the powerful therapeutic properties of the formed nanofibers and open a new gate for more experimental and clinical applications.

AB Cell based therapies are major focus of current research for treatment of liver diseases. In this study, mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly (WJ MSCs). Results confirmed that WJ MSCs isolated in this study could express the typical MSC specific markers and be induced to differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes. They could also be induced to differentiate into hepatocyte like cells. Poly (3 hydroxybutyrate co 3 hydroxyvalerate co 3 hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBVHHx) is a new member of polyhydroxyalkanoate family and biodegradable polyester produced by bacteria. PHBVHHx scaffolds showed much higher cell attachment and viability than the other polymers tested. PHBVHHx scaffolds loaded with WJ MSCs were transplanted into liver injured mice. Liver morphology improved after 30 days of transplantation and looked similar to normal liver. Concentrations of serum alanine aminotransferase and total bilirubin were significantly lower, and albumin was significantly higher on days 14 and 30 in the WJ MSCs+scaffold group than in the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) group. Hematoxylin eosin staining showed that liver had similar structure of normal liver lobules and similar size and shape of normal hepatic cells, and Masson staining demonstrated that liver had less blue staining for collagen after 30 days of transplantation. Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) showed that the expression of the bile duct epithelial cell gene CK 19 in mouse liver is significantly lower on days 14 and 30 in the WJ MSCs+scaffold group than in the CCl4 group. Real time RT PCR, immunocytochemistry, and periodic acid Schiff staining showed that WJ MSCs in scaffolds differentiated into hepatocyte like cells on days 14 and 30 in the WJ MSCs+scaffold group. Real time RT PCR also demonstrated that WJ MSCs in scaffolds expressed endothelial cell genes Flk 1, vWF, and VE cadherin on days 14 and 30 in the WJ MSCs+scaffold group, indicating that WJ MSCs also differentiated into endothelial like cells. These results demonstrated that PHBVHHx scaffolds loaded with WJ MSCs significantly promoted the recovery of injured liver and could be further studied for liver tissue engineering.

AB Background: Adverse side effects of the glitazones have been frequently reported in both clinical and animal studies, especially with rosiglitazone (RGZ) and pioglitazone (PGZ), including congestive heart failure, osteoporosis, weight gain, oedema and anaemia. These led to consideration of an evidence based hypothesis which would explain these diverse effects, and further suggested novel approaches by which this hypothesis could be tested.
   Presentation of hypothesis: The literature on the clinical, metabolic and endocrine effects of glitazones in relation to the reported actions of testosterone in diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease is reviewed, and the following unifying hypothesis advanced: "Glitazones induce androgen deficiency in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus resulting in pathophysiological changes in multiple tissues and organs which may explain their observed clinical adverse effects." This also provides further evidence for the lipocentric concept of diabetes and its clinical implications.
   Testing of the hypothesis: Clinical studies to investigate the endocrine profiles, including measurements of TT, DHT, SHBG, FT and estradiol, together with LH and FSH, in both men and women with T2DM before and after RGZ and PGZ treatment in placebo controlled groups, are necessary to provide data to substantiate this hypothesis. Also, studies on T treatment in diabetic men would further establish if the adverse effects of glitazones could be reversed or ameliorated by androgen therapy. Basic sciences investigations on the inhibition of androgen biosynthesis by glitazones are also warranted.
   Implications of the hypothesis: Glitazones reduce androgen biosynthesis, increase their binding to SHBG, and attenuate androgen receptor activation, thus reducing the physiological actions of testosterone, causing relative and absolute androgen deficiency. This hypothesis explains the adverse effects of glitazones on the heart and other organs resulting from reversal of the action of androgens in directing the maturation of stem cells towards muscle, vascular endothelium, erythroid stem cells and osteoblasts, and away from adipocyte differentiation. The higher incidence of side effects with RGZ than PGZ, may be explained by a detailed study of the mechanism by which glitazones down regulate androgen biosynthesis and action, resulting in a state of androgen deficiency.
