AB Background: Zoledronic acid (ZOL) is a standard therapy for the prevention of skeletal related events (SREs) in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Although prostate specific antigen (PSA) is an established marker for monitoring prostate cancer patients, correlations between PSA and disease outcomes during ZOL therapy are unclear.
   Objective: To evaluate the relationships among PSA kinetics, bone directed therapy with ZOL, and clinical outcomes in men with bone metastases from CRPC using a ZOL phase 3 trial database.
   Design, setting, and participants: Exploratory analyses from a phase 3 trial in men with bone metastases from CRPC (n = 643) randomized to ZOL or placebo every 3 wk.
   Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: PSA levels during the first 3 mo of the study were evaluated in linear and logarithmic (log) models stratified using prognostic factors established in a ZOL phase 3 trial and a CRPC nomogram. Relative risks of SREs, bone disease progression (BDP), and death were calculated per 1 log (nanograms per milliliter) PSA increase. Baseline PSA models used the study median (PSA: 77.3 ng/ml) as the high/low cut off point.
   Results and limitations: A total of 202 placebo and 434 ZOL treated patients were assessable. In both groups, PSA increases correlated with significantly increased risks of death, BDP, and first SRE. In the placebo and ZOL groups, associated increases in risk per 1 log (nanograms per milliliter) PSA increase were 29% (p < 0.0001) and 10% (p < 0.0074), respectively, for BDP, and 24% (p = 0.0010) and 13% (p = 0.0079), respectively, for first SRE. Limitations include the retrospective nature of these analyses and the potential confounding effects of concurrent antineoplastic therapies.
   Conclusions: PSA is an important prognostic tool for survival in patients with bone metastases from CRPC, and these analyses show that PSA is also prognostic for BDP and SREs regardless of bone targeted therapy.

AB Atypical femoral fractures can be subsequent to a long term biphosphonates treatment; they have a high frequency of delayed healing. The authors describe a femoral pseudoarthrosis of an atypical fracture treated with intramedullary nailing in a female after prolonged alendronate therapy. Atypical femoral fractures can be subsequent to a long term biphosphonates treatment even if, in the literature, there is no clarity on the exact pathogenetic mechanism. The Task Force of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research described the major and minor features to define atypical fractures and recommends that all the five major features must be present while minor features are not necessary. Another controversial aspect regarding the atypical femoral fractures is the higher frequency of the delayed healing that can be probably related to a suppressed bone turnover caused by a prolonged period of bisphosphonates treatment. This concept could be corroborated by the Spet Tc exam. In the case of a pseudoarthrosis, there is not a standardization of the treatment. In this report, the authors describe a femoral pseudoarthrosis of an atypical fracture treated with intramedullary nailing in a female after prolonged alendronate therapy; the patient was studied with clinical, bioumoral end SPECT Tc exam of both femurs. Many studies show the relationship between bisphosphonates and the presence of atypical fractures. These fractures should be monitored more closely due to the risk of nonunion and they require considering an initial treatment with pharmacological augmentation to reduce the complications for the patient and the health care costs.

AB A prospective source of stem cells for bone tissue engineering is adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs), and BMP 2 has been proven to be highly effective in promoting the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells. Rarely has research been conducted on the impact of lactoferrin (LF) on ADSCs' osteogenic differentiation. As such, in this study, we examined the effects of LF and BMP 2 to assess the ability of LF to stimulate ADSCs' osteogenic differentiation. The osteogenic medium was supplemented with the LF at the following concentrations to culture ADSCs: 0, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 500 mu g/mL. The Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK 8) assay was used to measure the proliferation of ADSCs. Calcium deposition, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, real time polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR), and an ALP activity assay were used to establish osteogenic differentiation. RNA sequencing analysis was carried out to investigate the mechanism of LF boosting the osteogenic development of ADSCs. In the concentration range of 0 100 mu g/mL, LF concentration dependently increased the proliferative vitality and osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs. At a dose of 500 mu g/mL, LF sped up and enhanced differentiation, but inhibited ADSCs from proliferating. LF (100 and 500 mu g/mL) produced more substantial osteoinductive effects than BMP 2. The PI3 kinase/AKT (PI3K/AKT) and IGF R1 signaling pathways were significantly activated in LF treated ADSCs. The in vitro study results showed that LF could effectively promote osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs by activating the PI3K/AKT and IGF R1 pathways. In our in vitro investigation, an LF concentration of 100 mu g/mL was optimal for osteoinduction and proliferation. Our study suggests that LF is an attractive alternative to BMP 2 in bone tissue engineering. As a bioactive molecule capable of inducing adipose stem cells to form osteoblasts, LF is expected to be clinically used in combination with biomaterials as an innovative molecular and cellular therapy to promote bone repair.

AB Secreted protein CCN1, encoded by CYR61, is involved in wound healing, angiogenesis, and osteoblast differentiation. We identified CCN1 as a microenvironmental factor produced by mesenchymal cells and overexpressed in bones of a subset of patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), asymptomatic myeloma (AMM), and multiple myeloma (MM). Our analysis showed that overexpression of CYR61 was independently associated with superior overall survival of MM patients enrolled in our Total Therapy 3 protocol. Moreover, elevated CCN1 was associated with a longer time for MGUS/AMM to progress to overt MM. During remission from MM, high levels of CCN1 were associated with superior progression free and overall survival and stratified patients with molecularly defined high risk MM. Recombinant CCN1 directly inhibited in vitro growth of MM cells, and overexpression of CYR61 in MM cells reduced tumor growth and prevented bone destruction in vivo in severe combined immunodeficiency humice. Signaling through alpha(v)beta(3) was required for CCN1 prevention of bone disease. CYR61 expression may signify early perturbation of the microenvironment before conversion to overt MM and may be a compensatory mechanism to control MM progression.

AB Diosgenin, an essential dietary steroidal sapogenin, possess multiple pharmacological activities. This study aimed to assess the effects of diosgenin on periodontitis and elucidate the mechanisms. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLCs) and a Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g) plus ligation induced animal model were used for in vitro and in vivo studies, respectively. Inflammatory responses, nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) signaling and osteogenesis related markers were measured both in LPS stimulated hPDLSCs and in gingival tissue of periodontitis rats. Treatment with diosgenin significantly inhibited the production of tumor necrosis factor a (TNF alpha), interleukin (IL) 1 beta, and interleukin (IL) 6 and the activation of NF kappa B pathway in LPS stimulated hPDLSCs. Further, treatment with diosgenin enhanced the expression of osteoblast related genes and increased the osteogenic differentiation capacity. Further, activation NF kappa B pathway largely abolished the protective effects of diosgenin. Consistent with the in vitro studies, in vivo studies showed that administering diosgenin to periodontitis rats significantly lowered the levels of the TNF alpha, IL 1 beta, and IL 6 and the inflammatory transcription factor NF kappa B in gingival tissue. In addition, osteoblast related genes were promoted. Diosgenin attenuates periodontitis by adjusting NF kappa B signaling to inhibit inflammatory effects and promoting osteogenesis, suggesting diosgenin might be developed as a therapeutic strategy for treating periodontitis in the future.

AB Transcribed from the SOST gene, sclerostin is an osteocyte derived negative regulator of bone formation that inhibits osteoblastogenesis via antagonism of the Wnt pathway. Sclerostin is a promising therapeutic target for low bone mass diseases and neutralizing antibody therapies that target sclerostin are in development. Diverse stimuli regulate SOST including the vitamin D hormone, forskolin (Fsk), bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP 2), oncostatin M (OSM), dexamethasone (Dex), and transforming growth factor (TGF beta(1)). To explore the mechanisms by which these compounds regulate SOST expression, we examined their ability to regulate a SOSTreporter minigene containing the entire SOST locus including the downstream region or mutant minigenes containing a deletion of the  1 kb to  2 kb promoter proximal region ( 1 kb), ECR2, ECR5, or two point mutations in the MEF2 binding site of ECR5 (ECR5/MEF2). Previous reports suggest that both the PTH and TGF beta(1) effects on SOST are mediated through ECR5 and that the action of PTH is mediated specifically via the MEF2 binding site at ECR5. Consistent with these reports, the suppressive effects of Fsk were abrogated following both ECR5 deletion and ECR5/MEF2 mutation. In contrast, we found that TGF beta(1) negatively regulated SOST and that neither ECR5 nor ECR5/MEF2 was involved. Surprisingly, none of these four deletions/mutations abrogated the suppressive effects of the vitamin D hormone, OSM, Dex, or TGF beta(1), or the positive effects of BMP 2. These data suggest that we need to move beyond ECR5 to understand SOST regulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Infrequent delivery of a long acting PTH Fc fusion protein has potent
   anabolic effects on cortical and cancellous bone

AB Introduction: The anabolic effects of PTH are currently achieved with, and thought to require, daily injections that result in brief exposure to the peptide. We hypothesized that less frequent but more sustained exposures to PTH could also be anabolic for bone, provided that serum levels of PTH were not constant.
   Materials and Methods: PTH(1 34) was fused to the Fc fragment of human IgG1. to increase the half life of PTH. Skeletal anabolism was examined in mice and rats treated once or twice per week with this PTH Fc fusion protein.
   Results: PTH Fc and PTH(1 34) had similar effects on PTH/PTHrP receptor activation, internalization, and signaling in vitro. However, PTH Fc had a 33 fold longer mean residence time in the circulation of rats compared with that of PTH(1 34). Subcutaneous injection of PTH Fc once or twice per week resulted in significant increases in bone volume, density, and strength in osteopenic ovariectomized mice and rats. These anabolic effects occurred in association with hypercalcemia and were significantly greater than those achievable with high concentrations of daily PTH(1 34). PTH Fc also significantly improved cortical bone volume and density under conditions where daily PTH(1 34) did not. Antiresorptive co therapy with estrogen further enhanced the ability of PTH Fc to increase bone mass and strength in ovariectomized rats.
   Conclusions: These results challenge the notion that brief daily exposure to PTH is essential for its anabolic effects on cortical and cancellous bone. PTH derived molecules with a sustained circulating half life may represent a powerful and previously undefined anabolic regimen for cortical and cancellous bone.

AB HIV infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy present an increased prevalence of age related comorbidities, including osteoporosis. HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) have been suspected to participate to bone loss, but the mechanisms involved are unknown. In endothelial cells, some PIs have been shown to induce the accumulation of farnesylated prelamin A, a biomarker of cell aging leading to cell senescence. Herein, we hypothesized that these PIs could induce premature aging of osteoblast precursors, human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and affect their capacity to differentiate into osteoblasts. Senescence was studied in proliferating human MSCs after a 30 day exposure to atazanavir and lopinavir with or without ritonavir. When compared to untreated cells, PI treated MSCs had a reduced proliferative capacity that worsened with increasing passages. PI treatment led to increased oxidative stress and expression of senescence markers, including prelamin A. Pravastatin, which blocks prelamin A farnesylation, prevented PI induced senescence and oxidative stress, while treatment with antioxidants partly reversed these effects. Moreover, senescent MSCs presented a decreased osteoblastic potential, which was restored by pravastatin treatment. Because age related bone loss is associated with increased bone marrow fat, we also evaluated the capacity of PI treated MSCs to differentiate into adipocyte. We observed an altered adipocyte differentiation in PI treated MSCs that was reverted by pravastatin. We have shown that some PIs alter osteoblast formation by affecting their differentiation potential in association with altered senescence in MSCs, with a beneficial effect of statin. These data corroborate the clinical observations and allow new insight into pathophysiological mechanisms of PI induced bone loss in HIV infected patients.

AB Background: Nobiletin (NOB), a polymethoxy flavonoid, possesses anti cancer and anti inflammatory activities, has been reported that it played role in anti osteoporosis treatment. However, previous research did not focus on practical use due to lack of hydrophilicity and cytotoxicity at high concentrations. The aim of this study was to develop a therapeutic formulation for osteoporosis based on the utilization of NOB.
   Methods: In this study, NOB loaded poly(ethylene glycol) block poly(e caprolactone) (NOB PEG PCL) was prepared by dialysis method. The effects on osteoclasts and anti osteoporosis functions were investigated in a RANKL induced cell model and ovariectomized (OVX) mice.
   Results: Dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy examination results revealed that the NOB PEG PCL had a round shape, with a mean diameter around 124 nm. The encapsulation efficiency and drug loading were 76.34 +/  3.25% and 7.60 +/  0.48%, respectively. The in vitro release of NOB from NOB PEG PCL showed a remarkably sustained releasing characteristic and could be retained at least 48 hrs in pH 7.4 PBS. Anti osteoclasts effects demonstrated that the NOB PEG PCL significantly inhibited the formation of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) positive multinuclear cells stimulated by RANKL. Furthermore, the NOB PEG PCL did not produce cytotoxicity on bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs). The mRNA expressions of genetic markers of osteoclasts including TRAP and cathepsin K were significantly decreased in the presence of NOB PEG PCL. In addition, the NOB PEG PCL inhibited OC differentiation of BMMs through RANKL induced MAPK signal pathway. After administration of the NOB PEG PCL, NOB PEG PCL prevented bone loss and improved bone density in OVX mice. These findings suggest that NOB PEG PCL might have great potential in the treatment of osteoporosis.
   Conclusion: The results suggested that NOB PEG PCL micelles could effectively prevent NOB fast release from micelles and extend circulation time. The NOB PEG PCL delivery system may be a promising way to prevent and treat osteoporosis.

AB Cancer progression has been associated with the presence of tumor associated M2 macrophages (M2 TAMs) able to inhibit anti tumor immune responses. It is also often associated with metastasis induced bone destruction mediated by osteoclasts. Both cell types are controlled by the CD115 (CSF 1R)/colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF 1, M CSF) pathway, making CD115 a promising target for cancer therapy. Anti human CD115 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that inhibit the receptor function have been generated in a number of laboratories. These mAbs compete with CSF 1 binding to CD115, dramatically affecting monocyte survival and preventing osteoclast and macrophage differentiation, but they also block CD115/CSF 1 internalization and degradation, which could lead to potent rebound CSF 1 effects in patients after mAb treatment has ended. We thus generated and selected a non ligand competitive anti CD115 mAb that exerts only partial inhibitory effects on CD115 signaling without blocking the internalization or the degradation of the CD115/CSF 1 complex. This mAb, H27K15, affects monocyte survival only minimally, but downregulates osteoclast differentiation and activity. Importantly, it inhibits monocyte differentiation to CD163(+)CD64(+) M2 polarized suppressor macrophages, skewing their differentiation toward CD14( )CD1a(+) dendritic cells (DCs). In line with this observation, H27K15 also drastically inhibits monocyte chemotactic protein 1 secretion and reduces interleukin 6 production; these two molecules are known to be involved in M2 macrophage recruitment. Thus, the non depleting mAb H27K15 is a promising anti tumor candidate, able to inhibit osteoclast differentiation, likely decreasing metastasis induced osteolysis, and able to prevent M2 polarization of TAMs while inducing DCs, hence contributing to the creation of more efficient anti tumor immune responses.

AB Simvastatin, an inhibitor of 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, is a cholesterol lowering drug that may play a role in bone metabolism through a mechanism that is not fully understood. Recently, receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand (RANKL), a member of the TNF superfamily, has emerged as a major mediator of bone loss via activation of osteoclastogenesis. The latter is also associated with certain cancers such as multiple myeloma and breast cancer. Whether simvastatin can modulate RANKL induced or cancer induced osteoclastogenesis was investigated. The effect of simvastatin on RANKL signaling and consequent osteoclastogenesis was investigated. RANKL induced NF kappa B activation, whereas pretreatment with simvastatin completely suppressed such activation and correlated with suppression of RANKL induced activation of I kappa B alpha kinase, I kappa B alpha phosphorylation and I kappa B alpha degradation. Similarly, RANKL induced the differentiation of monocytic cells to osteoclasts, whereas simvastatin suppressed it. The inhibition was maximal when cells were exposed to both simvastatin and RANKL simultaneously and minimal when simvastatin was added I day after RANKL treatment. Simvastatin also inhibited the osteoclastogenesis induced by human breast cancer and by multiple myeloma cells. Together, our results indicate that simvastatin inhibits the RANKL induced NF kappa B activation pathway that leads to suppression of osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL and by tumor cells, thereby suggesting its therapeutic potential in osteoporosis and in cancer related bone loss.

AB Background: Optimal dosing of bone targeted agents (BTAs), in patients with bone metastases remains an important clinical question. This trial compared 4 weekly versus 12 weekly therapy.
   Patients and methods: Patients with bone metastases from breast or castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), who were going to start or already on BTAs, were randomised 1:1 to 4 weekly or 12 weekly BTA treatment for one year. Primary end point was change in health related quality of life (HRQoL) physical function European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ C30). Secondary end points included pain (EORTC QLQ BM22), global health status (EORTC QLQ C30), symptomatic skeletal events (SSEs) rates and time to SSEs. Primary analysis was per protocol and a non inferiority margin of 5 points was used.
   Results: Of 263 patients (160 breast cancer, 103 CRPC), 133 (50.6%) and 130 (49.4%) were randomised to the 4  and 12  weekly groups, respectively. BTAs included denosumab (56.3%), zoledronate (24.0%) and pamidronate (19.8%). Using repeated measures analysis, across all time points, patients in the 4 weekly arm had a mean HRQL physical subdomain score which was 1.2 (95% confidence interval:  1.6 to 4.0) higher than the 12 weekly arm. The study met the definition of non inferiority for our primary outcome. Secondary outcomes showed no significant difference in scores for pain, global health status, SSE rates and SSEfree survival between arms. Subgroup analyses for cancer type, prior BTA use or BTA type showed no significant difference between arms.
   Conclusion: These results in addition to those previously reported for de escalating zoledronate and systematic reviews in both breast and prostate cancers, would support that deescalation of commonly used BTAs is a reasonable treatment option. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The osteoclast initiates resorption by creating a resorption lacuna. The ruffled border surrounding the lacunae arises from exocytosis of lysosomes. To dissolve the inorganic phase of the bone, the vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase, located in the ruffled border, pumps protons into the resorption lacunae. The electroneutrality of the lacunae is maintained by chloride transport through the chloride proton antiporter chloride channel 7. Inhibition of either proton or chloride transport prevents bone resorption. The aims of this study were to validate the human osteoclastic microsome based influx assay with respect to lysosomal acidification and assess whether it is a reliable test of a compound's ability to inhibit acidification. Investigated were the expression levels of the lysosomal acidification machinery, the activation of the assay by adenosine triphosphate, H+ and Cl  dependency, the effect of valinomycin, inhibitor sensitivity, and the ion profile of the human osteoclast microsomes. The expression level of chloride channel 7 was increased in the human osteoclastic microsomes compared with whole osteoclasts. Acid influx was induced by 1.25 mM adenosine triphosphate. Further 1.1 mu M valinomycin increased the acid influx by 129%. Total abrogation of acid influx was observed using both H+ and Cl  ionophores. Finally, investigation of the anion profile demonstrated that Cl  and Br  are the preferred anions for the transporter. In conclusion, the acid influx assay based on microsomes from human osteoclasts is a useful tool for detection of inhibitors of the osteoclastic acidification machinery, and thus may aid the identification of effective drugs for osteoporosis that target the acid secretion by osteoclasts.

   ROLE
AB Osteopenia, osteoporosis and bone salt metabolism disorder are common diseases in the aged and diabetics. From case reports of patients with T2DM, we have observed that metformin can decrease risk of bone fracture and promote bone formation. However, the underlying mechanism of metformin's effect on bone metabolism remains unknown. In our research, we show that metformin can promote proliferation of murine preosteoblast by regulating AMPK mTORC2 and AKT mTORC1 signaling axis. Furthermore, we have observed that metformin can promote SIRT6 expression before and during differentiation of murine preosteoblast. The interaction between SIRT6 and NF kappa B is highly important in osteoblast differentiation just as the relationship between OPG and RANKL in the process of bone formation. During differentiation, we show that SIRT6 inhibits phosphorylation of NF kappa B and that OPG increases while RANKL decrease in HG groups. In addition, ablation of sirt6 in mice causes phosphorylation of NF kappa B at high levels and RANKL increases slightly in femur bone cells. However, other bone formation marker proteins such as RUNX2, OSTERIX and OPG appear at low levels in sirt6 KO mice. It has been confirmed that downregulation of OCT4 is critical incident in the differentiation of embryonic stem cells. Fortunately, we observe that SIRT6 can suppress OCT4 expression in murine preosteoblast and the expression of OCT4 is at high level in sirt6 KO mice. Taken together, this study's results illuminate metformin's effect on bone metabolism under HG condition and help to elucidate why metformin can promote bone fracture healing of patients with T2DM.

AB Glucocorticoid (GC) induced osteoporosis (GIO) is a concurrent disease commonly appeared in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disease patients. Stereoselective recognition between chiral drugs and homochiral biological molecules could directly affect their distribution, adhesion and transport. Herein, trace element selenium (Se) with bone formation regulating activity, is employed to construct cysteine decorated chiral nanoparticles (Cys@SeNPs) to attenuate GIO. Interestingly, comparing with the racemic (DL Cys@SeNPs) and D Cys@SeNPs, the L Cys@SeNPs displays higher uptake in osteoblast cells and could lessen reactive oxygen species overproduction to block dexamethasone (Dex) induced osteoblasts cells apoptosis. Intracellular L Cys@SeNPs could be predominantly transformed to selenocystine to upregulate the expression levels of antioxidative selenoproteins to effectively scavenge Dex induced excessive ROS accumulation in osteoblasts, and thus reduce the undesirable apoptosis through activating Wnt/beta catenin pathway. Consistently, L Cys@SeNPs significantly alleviates the main osteoporosis symptoms of bone trabeculae destruction and decreased bone density in vivo, and also reduces the weight gain and fatty liver formation in Dex exposed mice, thus suppressing the overall side effects of Dex. This study not only demonstrates an effective strategy for treatment of GIO by using chiral Se nanomedicine, but also elucidates the important roles of selenoproteins in alleviating osteoporosis, which could help for future Se based drug design through chirality control engineering.

AB Osteosarcoma is a rare type of bone cancer, and half of the cases affect children and adolescents younger than 20 years of age. Despite intensive efforts to improve both chemotherapeutics and surgical management, the clinical outcome for metastatic osteosarcoma remains poor. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) is one of the most abundant growth factors in bones. The TGF beta signaling pathway has complex and contradictory roles in the pathogenesis of human cancers. TGF beta is primarily a tumor suppressor that inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of premalignant epithelial cells. In the later stages of cancer progression, however, TGF beta functions as a metastasis promoter by promoting tumor growth, inducing epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), blocking antitumor immune responses, increasing tumor associated fibrosis, and enhancing angiogenesis. In contrast with the dual effects of TGF beta on carcinoma (epithelial origin) progression, TGF beta seems to mainly have a pro tumoral effect on sarcomas including osteosarcoma (mesenchymal origin). Many drugs that target TGF beta signaling have been developed: neutralizing antibodies that prevent TGF beta binding to receptor complexes; ligand trap employing recombinant Fc fusion proteins containing the soluble ectodomain of either type II (T beta RII) or the type III receptor ((T beta RIII), preventing TGF beta from binding to its receptors; antisense nucleotides that reduce TGF beta expression at the transcriptional/translational level; small molecule inhibitors of serine/threonine kinases of the type I receptor (T beta RI) preventing downstream signaling; and vaccines that contain cell lines transfected with T beta RII antisense genes, or target furin convertase, resulting in reduced TGF beta signaling. TGF beta antagonists have been shown to have effects on osteosarcoma in vitro and in vivo. One of the small moleculeT beta RI inhibitors, Vactosertib, is currently undergoing a phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate its effect on osteosarcoma. Several phase 1/2/3 clinical trials have shown TGF beta antagonists are safe and well tolerated. For instance, Luspatercept, a TGF beta ligand trap, has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of anemia associated with myeloid dysplastic syndrome (MDS) with ring sideroblasts/mutated SF3B1 with acceptable safety. Clinical trials evaluating the long term safety of Luspatercept are in process.

AB Context Hypoparathyroidism is a rare disorder characterized by a deficiency in PTH resulting in hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalciuria. Eneboparatide is an investigational peptide agonist of the PTH1 receptor for the treatment of chronic hypoparathyroidism (HP).Objective To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of eneboparatide in HP patients.Design Open label, phase 2 study.Participants Twenty eight patients (21 women, 7 men), mean age (range): 58 years (28 72), with HP were enrolled into 2 consecutive cohorts (C1, n = 12 and C2, n = 16).Intervention Following an optimization period, daily subcutaneous injections of eneboparatide were administered for 3 months at a 20 mu g/day (C1) or 10 mu g/day (C2) starting dose. Conventional therapy was progressively removed, and eneboparatide could be titrated up to 60 mu g (C1) or 80 mu g (C2).Main outcomes Proportion of patients achieving independence from conventional therapy, albumin adjusted serum calcium (ADsCa), 24 h urine calcium (uCa), serum bone turnover markers (serum carboxy terminal telopeptide of type I collagen and procollagen 1 intact N terminal propeptide), bone mineral density (BMD), and adverse events (AEs).Results After 3 months, >= 88% of patients achieved independence from conventional therapy while mean ADsCa was maintained within target range (7.8 9 mg/dL). Eneboparatide induced a rapid and sustained reduction of mean 24 hour uCa, even among patients with hypercalciuria. Bone turnover markers slightly increased, and BMD remained unchanged, consistent with progressive resumption of physiologic bone turnover. Eneboparatide was well tolerated with no serious AEs.Conclusion Eneboparatide allowed independence from conventional therapy and maintenance of serum calcium within a target range while normalizing uCa excretion and producing a balanced resumption of bone turnover.

Therefore, preconditioning strategies to enhance the osteogenic potential of atMSCs could optimize cell therapy outcomes, and photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy has emerged as an effective, noninvasive, and low cost alternative. This study explored the impacts of PBM on at MSCs differentiation and the subsequent repair of bone defects treated with cell injection. Rat at MSCs were cultured and irradiated (at MSCsPBM) following the PBM protocol (660 nm; 20 mW; 0.714 W/cm2; 0.14 J; 5 J/cm2). Cellular differentiation was assessed based on the expression of gene and protein markers. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected using fluorescence. At MSCsPBM were injected into 5 mm calvarial lesions, and bone formation was analyzed using micro CT and histological evaluations. At MSCs were used as control. Data were analyzed using the ANOVA or t test. At MSCsPBM exhibited high levels of gene and protein runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and alkaline phosphatase (Alp) expression. PBM increased ALP activity and significantly reduced ROS levels. In addition, PBM increased the expression of Wnt pathway associated genes. In vivo, there was an increase in the morphometric parameters, including bone volume, percentage of bone volume, bone surface area, and trabecular number, in at MSCsPBM treated defects compared with those in the control. These findings suggest that PBM enhances the osteogenic potential of at MSCs, thereby supporting the advancement of improved cellular therapies for bone regeneration.

AB Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP) 2 has been approved by the FDA for clinical application, but its use is limited due to high cost and a supra physiological dose for therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, recent studies have focused on the generation of new therapeutic small molecules to induce bone formation or potentiate the osteogenic activity of BMP 2. Here, we show that [4 (7 chloroquinolin 4 yl) piperazino][1 phenyl 5 (trifluoromethyl)  1H pyrazol 4 yl] methanone (KM11073) strongly enhances the BMP 2stimulated induction of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), an early phase biomarker of osteoblast differentiation, in bi potential mesenchymal progenitor C2C12 cells. The KM11073 mediated ALP induction was inhibited by the BMP antagonist noggin, suggesting that its osteogenic activity occurs via BMP signaling. In addition, a pharmacological inhibition study suggested the involvement of p38 activation in the osteogenic action of KM11073 accompanied by enhanced expression of BMP 2,  6, and  7 mRNA. Furthermore, the in vivo osteogenic activity of KM11073 was confirmed in zebrafish and mouse calvarial bone formation models, suggesting the possibility of its single use for bone formation. In conclusion, the combination of rhBMP 2 with osteogenic small molecules could reduce the use of expensive rhBMP 2, mitigating the undesirable side effects of its supra physiological dose for therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, due to their inherent physical properties, small molecules could represent the next generation of regenerative medicine.

AB Purpose of reviewSince the release of the 2022 Second International Workshop Evaluation and Management of Hypoparathyroidism Summary Statement and Guidelines, updates and advances are now available in the cause, complications, and treatment of adult chronic hypoparathyroidism (hypoPTH). This review aims to highlight these new findings and implications to patient care.Recent findingsPostsurgical hypoparathyroidism remains the most common cause, immune related hypoparathyroidism from checkpoint inhibitors is an emerging autoimmune cause. In a large retrospective cohort study of thyroidectomies, incident fracture was lower, particularly in the vertebra, in the hypoPTH cohort, compared with postthyroidectomy control group. Hypercalciuria increases risk for renal calculi in hypoPTH independent of disease duration and treatment dose. Quality of life is impaired in hypoPTH patients on conventional therapy, improvement was noted post PTH replacement. TranCon PTH phase 3 RCT reported eucalcemia with reduced renal calcium excretion, normalization of bone turn over markers, stable BMD and improved quality of life.SummaryHypoPTH is a chronic disease associated with significant morbidity and poor Quality of Life. Awareness of treatment targets and follow up investigations can alleviate patient anxiety regarding over treatment and under treatment. Progress in long acting PTH replacement strategies might provide accessible, feasible alternatives to conventional therapy in brittle hypoPTH patients.

AB In this study, a beta tricalcium phosphate (beta TCP)/poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) bone tissue scaffold was loaded with osteogenesis promoting drug HA15 and constructed by three dimensional (3D) printing technology. This drug deliver) , system with favorable biomechanical properties, bone conduction function, and local release of osteogenic drugs could provide the basis for the treatment of bone defects. The biomechanical properties of the scaffold were investigated by compressive testing, showing comparable biomechanical properties with cancellous bone tissue. Furthermore, the microstructure, pore morphology, and condition were studied. Moreover, the drug release concentration, the effect of antituberculosis drugs in vitro and in rabbit radial defects, and the ability of the scaffold to repair the defects were studied. The results show that the scaffold loaded with HA15 can promote cell differentiation into osteoblasts in vitro, targeting HSPA5. The micro computed tomography scans showed that after 12 weeks of scaffold implantation. the defect of the rabbit radius was repaired and the peripheral blood vessels were regenerated. Thus. HA15 can target HSPA5 to inhibit endoplasmic reticulum stress which finally leads to promotion of osteogenesis, bone regeneration, and angiogenesis in the rabbit bone defect model. Overall. the 3D printed beta TCP/PLGA loaded HA15 bone tissue scaffold can be used as a substitute material for the treatment of bone defects because of its unique biomechanical properties and bone conductivity.

AB Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such as tamoxifen (TAM), have been used extensively for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer and other pathologies associated with aberrant estrogen receptor (ER) signaling. These compounds exhibit cell selective agonist/antagonist activities as a consequence of their ability to induce different conformational changes in ER, thereby enabling it to recruit functionally distinct transcriptional coregulators. However, the observation that SERMs can also regulate aspects of calcium signaling and apoptosis in an ER independent manner in some systems suggests that some of the activity of drugs within this class may also arise as a consequence of their ability to interact with targets other than ER. In this study, we demonstrate that 4 hydroxy TAM (4OHT), an active metabolite of TAM, directly binds to and modulates the transcriptional activity of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Of specific interest was the observation, that in the absence of ER, 4OHT can induce the expression of AHR target genes involved in estradiol metabolism, cellular proliferation, and metastasis in cellular models of breast cancer. The potential role for AHR in SERM pharmacology was further underscored by the ability of 4OHT to suppress osteoclast differentiation in vitro in part through AHR. Cumulatively, these findings provide evidence that it is necessary to reevaluate the relative roles of ER and AHR in manifesting the pharmacological actions and therapeutic efficacy of TAM and other SERMs. (Molecular Endocrinology 24: 33 46, 2010)

AB Osteoporosis (OP) is characterized by a loss in bone mass and mineral density. The stimulation of the canonical Wnt/beta catenin pathway has been reported to promote bone formation, this pathway is controlled by several regulators as secreted frizzled related protein 1 (Sfrp 1), antagonist of the pathway. Thus, Sfrp 1 silencing therapies could be suitable for enhancing bone growth. However, the systemic stimulation of Wnt/beta catenin has been correlated with side effects. This work hypothesizes the administration of lipid polymer NPs (LPNPs) functionalized with a MSC specific aptamer (Apt) and carrying a SFRP1 silencing GapmeR, could favor bone formation in OP with minimal undesired effects. Suitable SFRP1 GapmeR loaded Apt LPNPs (Apt LPNPs SFRP1) were administered in osteoporotic mice and their biodistribution, toxicity and bone induction capacity were evaluated. The aptamer functionalization of the NPs modified their biodistribution profile showing a four fold increase in the bone accumulation and a ten fold decrease in the hepatic accumulation compared to naked LPNPs. Moreover, the histological evaluation revealed evident changes in bone structure observing a more compact trabecular bone and a cortical bone thickness increase in the Apt LPNPs SFRP1 treated mice with no toxic effects. Therefore, these LPNPs showed suitable properties and biodistribution profiles leading to an enhancement on the bone density of osteoporotic mice.

AB Methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3) is the main enzyme for N 6 methyladenosine (m(6)A) based methylation of RNAs and it has been implicated in many biological and pathophysiological processes. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential involvement of METTL3 in osteoblast differentiation and decipher the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. We demonstrated that METTL3 is downregulated in human osteoporosis and the ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model, as well as during the osteogenic differentiation. Silence of METTL3 by short interfering RNA (siRNA) decreased m(6)A methylation levels and inhibited osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and reduced bone mass, and similar effects were observed in METTL3(+/ ) knockout mice. In contrast, adenovirus mediated overexpression of METTL3 produced the opposite effects. In addition, METTL3 enhanced, whereas METTL3 silence or knockout suppressed, the m(6)A methylations of runt related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2; a key transcription factor for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation) and precursor (pre )miR 320. Moreover, downregulation of mature miR 320 rescued the decreased bone mass caused by METTL3 silence or METTL3(+/ ) knockout. Therefore, METTL3 based m(6)A modification favors osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs through m(6)A based direct and indirect regulation of RUNX2, and abnormal downregulation of METTL3 is likely one of the mechanisms underlying osteoporosis in patients and mice. Thus, METTL3 overexpression might be considered a new approach of replacement therapy for the treatment of human osteoporosis.

TI A Humanized Bone Niche Model Reveals Bone Tissue Preservation Upon

AB A cogent issue in cancer research is how to account for the effects of tumor microenvironment (TME) on the response to therapy, warranting the need to adopt adequate in vitro and in vivo models. This is particularly relevant in the development of strategies targeting cancer metabolism, as they will inevitably have systemic effects. For example, inhibition of mitochondrial complex I (CI), despite showing promising results as an anticancer approach, triggers TME mediated survival mechanisms in subcutaneous osteosarcoma xenografts, a response that may vary according to whether the tumors are induced via subcutaneous injection or by intrabone orthotopic transplantation. Thus, with the aim to characterize the TME of CI deficient tumors in a model that more faithfully represents osteosarcoma development, we set up a humanized bone niche ectopic graft. A prominent involvement of TME was revealed in CI deficient tumors, characterized by the abundance of cancer associated fibroblasts, tumor associated macrophages and preservation of osteocytes and osteoblasts in the mineralized bone matrix. The pseudo orthotopic approach allowed investigation of osteosarcoma progression in a bone like microenvironment setting, without being invasive as the intrabone cell transplantation. Additionally, establishing osteosarcomas in a humanized bone niche model identified a peculiar association between targeting CI and bone tissue preservation.

AB Background/Aim: Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) is a locally aggressive neoplasm that typically occurs in the ends (epiphyses) of long bones of young adults. Flat bones are uncommon sites of involvement. Herein, we describe an unusual case of pathologically proven GCT of the acromion. Case Report: The patient was a 39 year old woman with no history of trauma who presented with a 3 month history of right posterior shoulder pain. Physical examination revealed mild swelling and tenderness in the posterior aspect of the right shoulder. Plain radiograph showed a purely lytic lesion, suggestive of a bone tumor. Computed tomography demonstrated an intraosseous lytic lesion with associated cortical thinning and lack of periosteal reaction. On magnetic resonance imaging, the lesion exhibited slightly higher signal intensity compared to skeletal muscle on T1 weighted sequences and heterogeneous high signal intensity on T2weighted sequences. Strong enhancement was observed following gadolinium administration. The lesion was treated by extensive curettage with adjuvant therapy comprising ethanol and the remaining cavity was filled with polymethylmethacrylate bone cement. Histologically, the lesion was composed of round or spindle shaped mononuclear cells admixed with numerous osteoclast like giant cells. Immunohistochemically, the mononuclear neoplastic cells were diffusely positive for H3.3 G34W. The patient was asymptomatic and there was no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastasis 5 months after surgery. Conclusion: Although rare, acromial GCTB should be considered in thedifferential diagnosis of posterior shoulder pain, especially in young and early middle aged adults.

AB Microgravity induced bone loss is a main obstacle for long term space missions as it is difficult to maintain bone mass when loading stimuli is reduced. With a typical bone mineral density loss of 1.5% per month of microgravity exposure, the chances for osteoporosis and fractures may endanger astronauts' health. Parathyroid Hormone or PTH (1 34) is an FDA approved treatment for osteoporosis, and may reverse microgravity induced bone loss. However, PTH proteins requires refrigeration, daily subcutaneous injection, and have a short shelf life, limiting its use in a resource limited environment, like space. In this study, PTH was produced in an Fc fusion form via transient expression in plants, to improve the circulatory half life which reduces dosing frequency and to simplify purification if needed. Plant based expression is well suited for space medicine application given its low resource consumption and short expression timeline. The PTH Fc accumulation profile in plant was established with a peak expression on day 5 post infiltration of 373 +/  59 mg/kg leaf fresh weight. Once the PTH Fc was purified, the amino acid sequence and the binding affinity to its target, PTH 1 receptor (PTH1R), was determined utilizing biolayer interferometry (BLI). The binding affinity between PTH Fc and PTH1R was 2.30 x 10( 6) M, similar to the affinity between PTH (1 34) and PTH1R (2.31 x 10( 6) M). Its function was also confirmed in a cell based receptor stimulation assay, where PTH Fc was able to stimulate the PTH1R producing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with an EC50 of (8.54 +/  0.12) x 10( 9) M, comparable to the EC50 from the PTH (1 34) of 1.49 x 10( 8) M. These results suggest that plant recombinant PTH Fc exhibits a similar binding affinity and potency in a PTH1R activation assay compared to PTH. Furthermore, it can be produced rapidly at high levels with minimal resources and reagents, making it ideal for production in low resource environments such as space.

AB Background/Aims: Bone metastasis of cancer cells decreases patient survival and quality of life. Hybridization via the covalent coupling of two bioactive natural products is a useful strategy for developing more potent anticancer agents by enhancing their bioavailability and avoiding drug resistance. Methods: The in vivo activities of artemisinin daumone hybrid 15 (ARTD) were estimated in cancer cell inoculated mice and ovariectomized mice. The viability, migration, and invasion of cancer cells were measured via MTT, wound healing, and transwell invasion assays. ARTD regulated transcription factors were detected with an RT2 profiler PCR array kit and Western blotting. Osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity were detected with tartrate resistant acid phosphatase staining, a pit formation assay, gelatin zymography, and a cathepsin K ELISA assay. Results: ARTD blocked cancer associated osteolysis more potently than artemisinin in mice with intratibially inoculated breast cancer or lung cancer cells. ARTD inhibited the viability, migration, and invasion of breast and lung cancer cells in the absence or presence of transforming growth factor beta 1. ARTD treatment induced the expression of tumor suppressive activating transcription factor 3 and inhibited oncogenic E2F transcription factor 1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels. ARTD inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand induced osteoclast formation and bone resorbing activity by reducing the secreted levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 and cathepsin K. Furthermore, ARTD prevented estrogen deficiency induced bone loss in ovariectomized mice. Conclusion: ARTD may be a promising candidate for inhibiting cancer induced bone destruction. The application of ARTD may be extended to patients with chemotherapy induced ovarian failure or postmenopausal osteoporosis. (C) 2018 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Patients with advanced stage cancers frequently suffer from severe pain as a result of bone metastasis and bone destruction, for which there is no efficacious treatment. Here, using multiple mouse models of bone cancer, we report that agonists of the immune regulator STING (stimulator of interferon genes) confer remarkable protection against cancer pain, bone destruction, and local tumor burden. Repeated systemic administration of STING agonists robustly attenuates bone cancer induced pain and improves locomotor function. Interestingly, STING agonists produce acute pain relief through direct neuronal modulation. Additionally, STING agonists protect against local bone destruction and reduce local tumor burden through modulation of osteoclast and immune cell function in the tumor microenvironment, providing long term cancer pain relief. Finally, these in vivo effects are dependent on host intrinsic STING and IFN I signaling. Overall, STING activation provides unique advantages in controlling bone cancer pain through distinct and synergistic actions on nociceptors, immune cells, and osteoclasts. There is an unmet clinical need to develop therapies to alleviate metastatic bone pain, frequently observed in patients with advanced cancers. Here, using mouse models of bone cancer pain, the authors show that STING agonists not only suppress bone cancer tumor burden, but also attenuate bone pain and reduce cancer induced bone destruction.

AB Glucagon like peptide 2 (GLP2) is a proglucagon derived peptide that is involved in the regulation of energy absorption and exerts beneficial effects on glucose metabolism. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the GLP2 during osteogenic differentiation has not been illustrated. Herein, we indicated that GLP2 was demonstrated to result in positive action during the osteogenic differentiation of human osteosarcoma cells. Our findings demonstrate that GLP2 inhibis the growth of osteosarcoma cells in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistic investigations reveal GLP2 inhibits the expression and activity of nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B), triggering the decrease of c Myc, PKM2, and CyclinD1 in osteosarcoma cells. In particular, rescued NF kappa B abrogates the functions of GLP2 in osteosarcoma cells. Strikingly, GLP2 overexpression significantly increased the expression of osteogenesis associated genes (e.g., Ocn and PICP) dependent on c Fos BMP signaling, which promotes directed differentiation from osteosarcoma cells to osteoblasts with higher alkaline phosphatase activity. Taken together, our results suggested that GLP2 could be a valuable drug to promote directed differentiation from osteosarcoma cells to osteoblasts, which may provide potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of osteosarcoma.

AB Poly(ADP ribosyl)ation is known to be involved in a variety of cellular processes, such as DNA repair, cell death, telomere regulation, genomic stability and cell differentiation by poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP). While PARP inhibitors are presently under clinical investigation for cancer therapy, little is known about their side effects. However, PARP involvement in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation potentiates MSC related side effects arising from PARP inhibition. In this study, effects of PARP inhibitors on MSCs were examined. MSCs demonstrated suppressed osteogenic differentiation after 1 mu M PJ34 treatment without cytotoxicity, while differentiation of MSCs into chondrocytes or adipocytes was unaffected. PJ34 suppressed mRNA induction of osteogenic markers, such as Runx2, Osterix, Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2, Osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein, and Osteopontin, and protein levels of Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2, Osterix and Osteocalcin. PJ34 treatment also inhibited transcription factor regulators such as Smad1, Smad4, Smad5 and Smad8. Extracellular mineralized matrix formation was also diminished. These results strongly suggest that PARP inhibitors are capable of suppressing osteogenic differentiation and poly(ADP ribosyl)ation may play a physiological role in this process through regulation of BMP 2 signaling. Therefore, PARP inhibition may potentially attenuate osteogenic metabolism, implicating cautious use of PARP inhibitors for cancer treatments and monitoring of patient bone metabolism levels.

AB Thyroid hormone (TH) plays a crucial role in regulating the functions of both bone and adipose tissue. Given that TH exerts its cholesterol lowering effects in hepatic tissue through the TH receptor beta (TR beta), we hypothesized that TR beta agonist therapy using MGL3196 (MGL) would be effective in treating increased adiposity and bone loss in response to a 12 week high fat diet (HFD) in adult C57BL/6J mice. Transcriptional and serum profiling revealed that HFD induced leptin promoted weight gain in both males and females, but MGL only suppressed leptin induction and weight gain in males. In vitro studies suggest that estrogen suppresses MGL activity in adipocytes, indicating that estrogen might interfere with MGL TR beta function. Compared to systemic adiposity, HFD reduced bone mass in male but not female mice. Paradoxically, MGL treatment reversed macroscopic bone mineral density loss in appendicular bones, but micro CT revealed that MGL exacerbated HFD induced trabecular bone loss, and reduced bone strength. In studies on the mechanisms for HFD effects on bone, we found that HFD induced Rankl expression in male femurs that was blocked by MGL. By ex vivo assays, we found that RANKL indirectly represses osteoblast lineage allocation of osteoprogenitors by induction of inflammatory cytokines TNF alpha, IL 1 beta, and CCL2. Finally, we found that MGL functions in both systemic adiposity and bone by nongenomic TR beta signaling, as HFD mediated phenotypes were not rescued in TR beta 147F knockout mice with normal genomic but defective nongenomic TR beta signaling. Our findings demonstrate that the negative effects of HFD on body fat and bone phenotypes are impacted by MGL in a gender specific manner.

TI Effects of tetrahedral DNA nanostructures on the treatment of

AB Osteoporosis (OP) is a common disease characterized by bone loss and bone tissue microstructure degradation. Drug treatment is a common clinical treatment that aims to increase bone mass and bone density. Tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDNs) are three dimensional tetrahedral frames formed by folding four single stranded DNA molecules, which have good biological safety and can promote bone regeneration. In this study, a mouse model of OP was established by ovariectomy (OVX) and TDN was injected into the tail vein for 8 weeks. We found that ovariectomized mice could simulate some physiological changes in OP. After treatment with TDNs, some of this destruction in mice was significantly improved, including an increase in the bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and bone trabecular number (Tb. N), decrease in bone separation (Tb. SP), reduction in the damage to the mouse cartilage layer, reduction in osteoclast lacunae in bone trabecula, and reduction in the damage to the bone dense part. We also found that the expression of ALP, beta Catenin, Runx2, Osterix, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)2 significantly decreased in OVX mice but increased after TDN treatment. Therefore, this study suggests that TDNs may regulate the Wnt/beta Catenin and BMP signalling pathways to improve the levels of some specific markers of osteogenic differentiation, such as Runx2, ALP, and Osterix, to promote osteogenesis, thus showing a therapeutic effect on OP mice.

TI CD99 Drives Terminal Differentiation of Osteosarcoma Cells by Acting as

AB Differentiation therapy is an attractive treatment for osteosarcoma (OS). CD99 is a cell surface molecule expressed in mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblasts that is maintained during osteoblast differentiation while lost in OS. Herein, we show that whenever OS cells regain CD99, they become prone to reactivate the terminal differentiation program. In differentiating conditions, CD99 transfected OS cells express osteocyte markers, halt proliferation, and largely die by apoptosis, resembling the fate of mature osteoblasts. CD99 induces ERK activation, increasing its membrane bound/cytoplasmic form rather than affecting its nuclear localization. Through cytoplasmic ERK, CD99 promotes activity of the main osteogenic transcriptional factors AP1 and RUNX2, which in turn enhance osteocalcin and p21(WAF1/CIP1), leading to G(0)/G(1) arrest. These data underscore the alternative positions of active ERK into distinct subcellular compartments as key events for determining OS fate. (c) 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB Despite the abundant evidence on the biodegradability of K struvite (KMgPO 4 & sdot; 6H 2 O) that promotes bone regeneration, the cell related surface bioactivity still stays low owing to the absence of organic components. O   Carboxymethyl chitosan ( O  CMC) is a glycosaminoglycan mimetic with outstanding biocompatibility, biodegradability and solubility, which has been successfully used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM). In this study, we incorporated O  CMC into K struvite to prepare hybrid scaffolds (OMPCs) with increasing biphasic contents. We found that O  CMC improved the physicochemical properties, in vitro/vivo biocompatibility, and enzymatic biodegradability of K struvite, resulting in enhanced in vitro/vivo angiogenesis and osteogenesis via the proper release of Mg 2 + . In addition, we found differential expression of transient receptor potential cation channel member 7 (TRPM7) within the endothelial and osteoblast lineages, triggering the phosphorylation of the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK signaling pathways, respectively. In summary, it can be concluded that the biphasic addition of O  CMC is a viable method for improving the surface bioactivity of Kstruvite to accelerate bone regeneration.

TI Sustained Autocrine Induction and Impaired Negative Feedback of

AB Giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone is a histologically benign osteolytic tumor featuring prominent osteoclast like giant cells, mononuclear osteoclast precursors, and spindle shaped stromal cells (SCs). Thus far, most studies have identified SCs as truly transformed elements that are responsible for sustained giant cell formation via receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand (RANKL) paracrine induction. However, we have previously shown that SCs are hyperplastic, rather than neoplastic, and able to induce giant cell formation similar to that of normal mesenchymal SCs; we hypothesized that other cell subsets of GCTs might be primarily relevant for the pathogenesis. In this study, we show that the non proliferating CD14(+) cells of GCTs, exhibiting typical monoblast Lineage features, secrete high amounts of RANKL, thereby activating a RANKL/RANK autocrine loop that determines sustained giant cell formation. Moreover, these cells also lack adequate negative feedback control of the RANKL signaling pathway, as determined by endogenous interferon beta. These data demonstrate that CD14(+) cells of GCTs are abnormally stimulated to limitless differentiation into multinucleated giant cells and provide useful suggestions for the development of novel therapies.

AB A 67 year old woman was referred by her primary care physician for treatment of osteoporosis and progressive bone loss. One year before the visit, the patient had discontinued hormone replacement therapy. She had subsequently begun to experience midback pain and lost 3.8 cm (1.5 in.) in height. A dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan showed bone mineral density T scores of  3.1 at the lumbar spine and  2.8 at the femoral neck, which are consistent with a diagnosis of osteoporosis. One year later, a second scan showed a further decrease of 5.4% in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine (Fig. 1), as well as a compression fracture of the 11th thoracic vertebra (Fig. 2). Results of blood and urine tests ruled out the common secondary causes of osteoporosis. To prevent additional vertebral fractures, oral bisphosphonate therapy was recommended.

AB This chapter reviews the different options available for the use of ultrasound in the enhancement of fracture healing or in the reactivation of a failed healing process: LIPUS, shock waves and ultrasound mediated delivery of bioactive molecules, such as growth factors or plasmids. The main emphasis is on LIPUS, or Low Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound, the most widespread and studied technique. LIPUS has pronounced bioeffects on tissue regeneration, while employing intensities within a diagnostic range. The biological response to LIPUS is complex as the response of numerous cell types to this stimulus involves several pathways. Known to date mechanotransduction pathways involved in cell responses include MAPK and other kinases signaling pathways, gap junctional intercellular communication, up regulation and clustering of integrins, involvement of the COX 2/PGE2 and iNOS/NO pathways, and activation of the ATI mechanoreceptor. Mechanisms at the origin of LIPUS biological effects remain intriguing, and analysis is hampered by the diversity of experimental systems used in vitro. Data point to clear evidence that bioeffects can be modulated by direct and indirect mechanical effects, like acoustic radiation force, acoustic streaming, propagation of surface waves, heat, fluid flow induced circulation and redistribution of nutrients, oxygen and signaling molecules. One of the future engineering challenge is therefore the design of dedicated experimental set ups allowing control of these different mechanical phenomena, and to relate them to biological responses. Then, the derivation of an 'acoustic dose' and the cross calibration of the different experimental systems will be possible. Despite this imperfect knowledge of LIPUS biophysics, the clinical evidence, although most often of low quality, speaks in favor of the clinical use of LIPUS, when the economics of nonunion and the absence of toxicity of this ultrasound technology are taken into account.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects and explore the mechanism of a local injection of a single dose of simvastatin as a strategy to strengthen target bone. Simvastatin was injected into the femurs (5 or 10 mg) or caudal vertebrae (1 or 2 mg) of ovariectomized rats, with an equal volume of vehicle injected as a control. Bone mineral density (BMD), bone microstructure and strength were evaluated at 1 and 5 months post injection for the femurs and at 12 days post injection for the vertebrae. Bone mass, adipocyte numbers and Runx2 expression were also examined using histology and immunohistochemistry. Compared with controls, simvastatin significantly increased BMD, bone volume fraction (BV/TV), improved bone microstructural parameters and bone strength in the femurs at both time points (all P < 0.01). Simvastatin treated femurs contained fewer adipocytes and a higher Runx2 expression. For the caudal vertebrae, simvastatin significantly improved BV/TV, bone microstructures, and bone strength (all P < 0.01) as compared with controls. In conclusion, local injection of a single dose of simvastatin induces early onset and long lasting bone augmentation in osteoporotic bone, significantly improving BMD, and bone microstructure and biomechanical strength. Simvastatin induces Runx2 expression, which may function to induce osteogenesis and inhibit adipogenesis as an underlying mechanism to augment bone mass.

AB T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy with inferior outcome compared with that of B cell ALL. Here, we show that Runt related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) was upregulated in high risk T ALL with KMT2A rearrangements (KMT2A R) or an immature immunophenotype. In KMT2A R cells, we identified RUNX2 as a direct target of the KMT2A chimeras, where it reciprocally bound the KMT2A promoter, establishing a regulatory feed forward mechanism. Notably, RUNX2 was required for survival of immature and KMT2A R T ALL cells in vitro and in vivo. We report direct transcriptional regulation of CXCR4 signaling by RUNX2, thereby promoting chemotaxis, adhesion, and homing to medullary and extramedullary sites. RUNX2 enabled these energy demanding processes by increasing metabolic activity in T ALL cells through positive regulation of both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Concurrently, RUNX2 upregulation increased mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis in T ALL cells. Finally, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate that immature and KMT2A R T ALL cells were vulnerable to pharmacological targeting of the interaction between RUNX2 and its cofactor CBF beta. In conclusion, we show that RUNX2 acts as a dependency factor in high risk subtypes of human T ALL through concomitant regulation of tumor metabolism and leukemic cell migration.

TI Structural Insights into Notum Covalent Inhibition

AB The carboxylesterase Notum hydrolyzes a palmitoleate moiety from Wingless/Integrated(Wnt) ligands and deactivates Wnt signaling. Notum inhibitors can restore Wnt signaling which may be of therapeutic benefit for pathologies such as osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease. We report the identification of a novel class of covalent Notum inhibitors, 4 (indolin 1 yl) 4oxobutanoate esters. High resolution crystal structures of the Notum inhibitor complexes reveal a common covalent adduct formed between the nucleophile serine 232 and hydrolyzed butyric esters. The covalent interaction in solution was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. Inhibitory potencies vary depending on the warheads used. Mechanistically, the resulting acyl enzyme intermediate carbonyl atom is positioned at an unfavorable angle for the approach of the active site water, which, combined with strong hydrophobic interactions with the enzyme pocket residues, hinders the intermediate from being further processed and results in covalent inhibition. These insights into Notum catalytic inhibition may guide development of more potent Notum inhibitors.

AB Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) has been demonstrated to have antidiabetic and antiosteoporotic activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of Rg1 against diabetic osteoporosis and the underlying mechanism. In vitro, we found that Rg1 increased the number of osteoprogenitors and alleviated high glucose (HG) induced apoptosis of osteoprogenitors by MTT assays and flow cytometry. qRT PCR and western blot analysis suggested that Rg1 can also promote the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by osteoprogenitors and promote the coupling of osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Rg1 can also promote the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured in high glucose, enhance the angiogenic ability of endothelial cells, and activate the Notch pathway to promote endothelial cells to secrete the osteogenesis related factor Noggin to regulate osteogenesis, providing further feedback coupling of angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Therefore, we speculated that Rg1 may have similar effects on type H vessels. We used the Goto Kakizaki (GK) rat model to perform immunofluorescence staining analysis on two markers of type H vessels, Endomucin (Emcn) and CD31, and the osteoblast specific transcription factor Osterix, and found that Rg1 stimulates type H angiogenesis and bone formation. In vivo experiments also demonstrated that Rg1 promotes VEGF secretion, activates the Noggin/Notch pathway, increases the level of coupling between type H vessels and osteogenesis, and improves the bone structure of GK rats. All of these data reveal that Rg1 is a promising candidate drug for treating diabetic osteoporosis as a potentially bioactive molecule that promotes angiogenesis and osteointegration coupling.

AB BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of oestrogen receptor positive post menopausal breast cancer. These patients may also be receiving the bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid (ZA) to prevent bone loss or reduce skeletal morbidity in the setting of advanced disease. The potential biological interaction of these two drugs in breast cancer has not been assessed.
   METHODS: Aromatase expressing breast cancer cells were treated with letrozole and ZA either simultaneously or in sequence, and the resulting apoptosis was assessed by staining with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide and examined using a fluorescent inverted Leica DMIRB microscope and a UV filter.
   RESULTS: We found that letrozole and ZA induce levels of apoptosis in breast cancer cells in vitro that are significantly greater compared with treatment with each drug alone. However, this potentially, synergistic relationship is drug sequence dependent, occurring only when cells are treated with letrozole, followed by ZA. The converse sequence, or administering drugs simultaneously, induces levels of apoptosis no greater than each drug alone.
   CONCLUSION: Owing to the enhanced anti tumour efficacy of sequential drug administration, our findings may indicate that, for post menopausal women who require treatment with letrozole, ZA should also be considered.

   OUTCOMES
AB Both osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) share similar pathways in pathophysiology and are intercorrelated with increased morbidity and mortality in elderly women. Although denosumab and raloxifene are the current guideline based pharmacological treatments, their impacts on cardiovascular protection are yet to be examined. This study aimed to compare mortality rate and cardiovascular events between denosumab and raloxifene in osteoporotic women. Risks of CVD development and all cause mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression. A total of 7972 (3986 in each group) women were recruited between January 2003 and December 2018. No significant difference between denosumab and raloxifene was observed in composite CVDs, myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure. However, comparison of the propensity score matched cohorts revealed that patients with proportion of days covered (PDC) >= 60% had lower incidence of ischemic stroke in the denosumab group than that in the raloxifene group (aHR 0.68; 95% CI 0.47 0.98; p = 0.0399). In addition, all cause mortality was lower in the denosumab group than in the raloxifene group (aHR 0.59; 95% CI 0.48 0.72; p = 0.001), except in patients aged <65 y/o in this cohort study. We concluded that denosumab is superior to raloxifene in lowering risks of all cause mortality and certain ischemic strokes in osteoporotic women.

   IL 17/MAPK

   Osteoporosis; IL 17/MAPK pathway
AB Background: Osteoporosis (OP) is considered as one of the major comorbidities of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and is responsible for fragility fracture. However, there is currently no effective treatment for RA complicated with OP. Tubson 2 decoction (TBD), a Mongolian medicine also known as Erwei Duzhong Decoction, has been shown to exert a preventive effect on post menopausal osteoporosis (PMOP). The preventive effects of TBD on RA induced OP, as well as the bioactive compound responsible and the underlying mechanisms, remain to be elucidated.
   Objective: To explore the effects of TBD on RA induced OP in vivo, and to elucidate the mechanism of isochlorogenic acid A (ICA), the effective component of TBD, in vitro.
   Methods: To evaluate the anti arthritic and anti osteoporotic effects of TBD, we conducted H&E straining and safranine O/fast green, TEM, immunohistochemistry (IHC), bone histomorphometry, micro CT imaging, and biomechanical testing in collagen induced arthritis (CIA) rats. The active ingredient in TBD was identified using network pharmacology and molecular docking. The identification was supported by in vivo IHC assay, and further confirmed using qRT PCR, Western blot, and SEM analysis in TNF alpha treated MH7A cells and/or in LPS exposed RAW264.7 cells.
   Results: Oral administration of TBD attenuated the severity of arthritis and osteopenia as well as poor bone quality, in CIA rats. Additionally, TBD and the positive control, tripterygium glycosides (TG), exhibited similar effects in reducing inflammation in both the synovium and ankle joint. They also were both effective in improving bone loss, microarchitecture, and overall bone quality. TBD reduced the expression of MMP13, IL 17, and p JNK protein in the synovium of CIA rats. ICA, which was screened, suppressed TNF alpha or LPS triggered inflammatory responses via down regulating IL 17 signaling, involving in MMP13, IL 1 beta, IL 23, and IL 17, and the MAPK pathway including p ERK, p JNK, and p P38, both in MH7A cells and in RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, ICA prevented osteoclasts from differentiating and bone resoprtion in a dose dependent manner in vitro.
   Conclusion: This study provides the first evidence that TBD exerts intervening effects on RA induced OP, possibly through the downregulation of the IL 17/MAPK signaling pathway by ICA. The findings of our study provides valuable insights for further research in this area.

AB Strontium ranelate is an effective treatment for osteoporosis in treatment naive women. In the United Kingdom, bisphosphonates are often used first line. Prior bisphosphonate use may blunt the bone mineral density (BMD) response to strontium ranelate by reducing strontium uptake into the bone. Sixty bisphosphonate naive women and 60 women discontinuing bisphosphonates were recruited. All women commenced strontium ranelate and calcium/vitamin D. BMD and bone turnover markers were recorded for 12 months. After 12 months, the bisphosphonate naive group's BMD increased by 5.6% (p<.001) at the spine, 3.4% (p<.001) at the total hip, and 4.0% (p<.001) at the heel. By comparison, the prior bisphosphonate group had a 2.1% (p=.002) increase at the spine but no change at the hip or heel. At all time points, BMD was significantly greater in the bisphosphonate naive group. In the prior bisphosphonate group, there was no significant change in BMD during the first 6 months at the spine, but between months 6 and 12 there was a parallel gain in BMD (0.027 versus 0.020 g/cm(2), p=.40). The baseline difference in bone markers was no longer significant by 3 months for bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) and 6 months for procollagen type 1 amino terminal propeptide (P1NP) and carboxy terminal cross linking telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX). More women in the prior bisphosphonate group suffered a vertebral fracture (2 versus 8 women, p=.047). After bisphosphonates, bone turnover remains suppressed for up to 6 months, with blunting of the BMD response to strontium ranelate during this time. After 6 months, BMD increases in the spine but not at the hip or heel. 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB Zoledronic acid (ZOL) is a nitrogen containing bisphosphonate used for the treatment of bone diseases and calcium metabolism. Anticancer activity of ZOL has been established, but its extraskeletal effects are limited due to its rapid uptake and accumulation to bone hydroxyapatite. In this work, we report on the development of tethered lipid bilayer gated mesoporous silica nanocarriers (MSNs) for the incorporation, retention, and intracellular delivery of ZOL. The in vitro anticancer activity of ZOL loaded nanocarriers was evaluated by cell viability assay and live cell imaging. For in vivo delivery, the nanocarriers were tagged with folic acid to boost the affinity for breast cancer cells. Histological examination of the liver revealed no adverse off target effects stemming from the nanocarriers. Importantly, nonspecific accumulation of ZOL within bone was not observed, which indicated in vivo stability of the tethered lipid bilayers. Further, the intravenously administered ZOL loaded nanocarriers showed tumor growth suppression in breast cancer xenograft bearing mice.

   PENETRATION
AB Aim: To prepare pH sensitive nanoparticle composed of alendronate (ALN) and poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) to treat bone metastases of lung cancer. Methods: The solvent evaporation method was used to prepare docetaxel (DTX) loaded ALN PAMAM nanoparticles (DTX@ALN PAMAM). Results: The in vitro results showed DTX@ALN PAMAM significantly enhanced the anticancer activity of DTX and inhibited the formation of osteoclasts. DTX@ALN PAMAM concentrated at bone metastasis site in mice, which resulted in the suppression of bone resorption, pain response and growth of bone metastases. Eventually, the therapeutic effect of DTX on bone metastases of lung cancer was obviously improved. Conclusion: ALN modified PAMAM nanoparticle could be an effective platform for the treatment of bone metastases of lung cancer.

AB This article provides an overview of the clinical profile of the calcimimetic agentcinacalcet (Mimpara (R), Sensipar (R)) in the treatment of patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) undergoing dialysis for end stage renal disease (ESRD), followed by a comprehensive review of pharmacoeconomic analyses with cinacalcet in this patient population.
   Most patients with ESRD undergoing dialysis develop SHPT, which is associated with disturbances in bone mineral metabolism and the development of fractures, cardiovascular disease and other clinical events. Standard treatment of SHPT includes phosphate binders and active vitamin D derivatives. However, standard treatment alone seldom achieves recommended target plasma or serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium and phosphorous.
   The addition of cinacalcet to standard therapy in patients with SHPT undergoing dialysis for ESRD improves the likelihood of achieving target biochemical levels compared with standard therapy alone. On the basis of association studies, improvements in these intermediate endpoints are likely to reduce the risk of clinical events, such as fractures and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, part of the acquisition cost of cinacalcet is likely to be offset by reductions in other healthcare resource use, such as reductions in costs associated with a lower likelihood of clinical events, as well as potential reductions in dosages of standard treatment.
   A number of pharmacoeconomic analyses across various country settings indicate that cinacalcet plus standard therapy is cost effective relative to standard therapy alone if dialysis costs are excluded, or that early initiation of cinacalcet is cost effective compared with delaying cinacalcet treatment until PTH levels become very uncontrolled. However, across analyses with cinacalcet, results were variable and not always favourable. This wide range of results stems from differences in selection of data sources used to populate the models, regional differences in healthcare resource use and costs, as well as other factors. Future cost effectiveness analyses with cinacalcet should incorporate data on hard clinical outcomes from the EVOLVE study once this information becomes available.

AB Background Prostate cancer (PCa) patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) have an increased fracture risk. Exploring biomarkers for early bone loss detection is of great interest. Methods Pre planned substudy of the ARNEO trial (NCT03080116): a double blind, randomised, placebo  controlled phase 2 trial performed in high risk PCa patients without bone metastases between March 2019 and April 2021. Patients were 1:1 randomised to treatment with gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist (degarelix) + androgen receptor signalling inhibitor (ARSI; apalutamide) versus degarelix + matching placebo for 12 weeks prior to prostatectomy. Before and following ADT, serum and 24 h urinary samples were collected. Primary endpoints were changes in calcium phosphate homeostasis and bone biomarkers. Findings Of the 89 randomised patients, 43 in the degarelix + apalutamide and 44 patients in the degarelix + placebo group were included in this substudy. Serum corrected calcium levels increased similarly in both treatment arms (mean difference +0.04 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval, 0.02; 0.06), and parathyroid hormone and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels decreased. Bone resorption markers increased, and stable calcium isotope ratios reflecting net bone mineral balance decreased in serum and urine similarly in both groups. Interpretation This exploratory substudy suggests that 12 weeks of ADT in non metastatic PCa patients results in early bone loss. Additional treatment with ARSI does not seem to more negatively influence bone loss in the early phase. Future studies should address if these early biomarkers are able to predict fracture risk, and can be implemented in clinical practice for follow up of bone health in PCa patients under ADT.

AB The bone defects caused by trauma, tumor resections and congenital diseases can lead to deformity and dysfunction. Developing a biodegradable scaffold with tunable osteogenesis and degradation rates is highly essential for improving bone defect regeneration. Eggshell is a kind of natural biomaterial of which the major inorganic component is CaCO3. Herein, we synthesized MgO nanoparticle coated eggshell particles (defined as CaCO3/MgO nanocomposites) and subsequently fabricated a biomimetic active scaffold through the chemical crosslinking of the CaCO3/MgO nanocomposite, carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2). The results showed that the modulus and compressive strength of the new composite CaCO3/MgO/CMC/BMP2 scaffold were higher than those of the CMC scaffold. Interestingly, the composite scaffold exhibited significant mineralization ability and strong osteogenic differentiation potential. Moreover, an examination of the osteogenic differentiation mechanism clearly illustrated that Mg2+ ions and BMP2 released from the composite scaffold could activate the phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 and Akt pathways and promote osteogenesis through the crosstalk of multiple pathways. Finally, an in situ rat calvarial defect repair experiment showed excellent repair results of the composite scaffold. This study is very promising, as it provides new insights for developing natural CaCO3 based inorganic nanomaterials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

AB Iron pyrite, an important component of traditional Chinese medicine, has a poor solubility, bioavailability, and patient compliance due to a high dose required and associated side effects, all of which have limited its clinical applications and experimental studies on its action mechanisms in improving fracture healing. This study investigated Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (A.f) bioleaching of two kinds of pyrites and examined bioactivities of the derived solutions in viability and osteogenic differentiation in rat calvarial osteoblasts. A.f bioleaching improved element contents (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Se) in the derived solutions and the solutions concentration dependently affected osteoblast viability and differentiation. While the solutions had no effects at low concentrations and inhibited the osteoblast alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity at high concentrations, they improved ALP activity at their optimal concentrations. The improved osteoblast differentiation and osteogenic function at optimal concentrations were also revealed by levels of ALP cytochemical staining, calcium deposition, numbers and areas of mineralized nodules formed, mRNA and protein expression levels of osteogenesis related genes (osteocalcin, Bmp 2, Runx 2, and IGF 1), and Runx 2 nuclear translocation. Data from this study will be useful in offering new strategies for improving pyrite bioavailability and providing a mechanistic explanation for the beneficial effects of pyrite in improving bone healing.

AB Poor survival of grafted cells is the major impediment of successful cell based therapies for bone regeneration. Implanted cells undergo rapid death in an ischemic environment largely because of hypoxia and metabolic stress from glucose deficiency. Understanding the intracellular metabolic processes and finding genes that can improve cell survival in these inhospitable conditions are necessary to enhance the success of cell therapies. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate changes of metabolic profile in glucose deprived human bone marrow stromal/stem cells (hBMSCs) through metabolomics analysis and discover genes that could promote cell survival and osteogenic differentiation in a glucose deprived microenvironment. Metabolomics analysis was performed to determine metabolic changes in a glucose stress metabolic model. In the absence of glucose, expression levels of all metabolites involved in glycolysis were significantly decreased than those in a glucose supplemented state. In glucose deprived osteogenic differentiation, reliance on tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) predicted oxidative phosphorylation instead of glycolysis as the main mechanism for energy production in osteogenic induction. By comparing differentially expressed genes between glucose deprived and glucose supplemented hBMSCs, NR2F1 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 2 Group F Member 1) gene was discovered to be associated with enhanced survival and osteogenic differentiation in cells under metabolic stress. Small, interfering RNA (siRNA) for NR2F1 reduced cell viability and osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs under glucose supplemented conditions whereas NR2F1 overexpression enhanced osteogenic differentiation and cell survival of hBMSCs in glucose deprived osteogenic conditions via the protein kinase B (AKT)/extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. NR2F1 transfected hBMSCs significantly enhanced new bone formation in a critical size long bone defect of rats compared with control vector transfected hBMSCs. In conclusion, the results of this study provide an understanding of the metabolic profile of implanted cells in an ischemic microenvironment and demonstrate that NR2F1 treatment may overcome this deprivation by enhancing AKT and ERK regulation. These findings can be utilized in regenerative medicine for bone regeneration. (c) 2022 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).

AB The aim of this study was to provide a suitable mouse model of radiation induced delayed reaction and identify potential targets for drug development related to the prevention and treatment of radiation injury. C57BL/6J mice were subjected to singular (109 cGy/min, 5 Gy*1) and fractional (109 cGy/min, 5 Gy*2) total body irradiation. The behavior and activity of mice were assessed 60 days after ionizing radiation (IR) exposure. After that, the pathological changes and mechanism of the mouse brain and femoral tissues were observed by HE, Nissl, Trap staining micro CT scanning and RNA sequencing (RNA Seq), and Western blot. The results show that singular or fractional IR exposure led to a decrease in spatial memory ability and activity in mice, and the cognitive and motor functions gradually recovered after singular 5 Gy IR in a time dependent manner, while the fractional 10 Gy IR group could not recover. The decrease in bone density due to the increase in osteoclast number may be relative to the down regulation of RUNX2, sclerostin, and beta catenin. Meanwhile, the brain injury caused by IR exposure is mainly linked to the down regulation of BNDF and Tau. IR exposure leads to memory impairment, reduced activity, and self recovery, which are associated with time and dose. The mechanism of cognitive and activity damage was mainly related to oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by DNA damage. The damage caused by fractional 10 Gy TBI is relatively stable and can be used as a stable multi organ injury model for radiation mechanism research and anti radiation medicine screening.

AB Background: Although antiretroviral agents trigger bone loss in human immunodeficiency virus patients, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) induces more severe bone damage, such as osteoporosis. While, the mechanisms are unclear, probiotic supplements may be effective against osteoporosis. Methods: C57BL6/J mice were administered with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG)+TDF, TDF, and zoledronic acid+TDF, respectively. Bone morphometry and biomechanics were evaluated using microcomputed tomography, bone slicing, and flexural tests. The lymphocyte, proinflammatory cytokines, and intestinal permeability levels were detected using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays, quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, and flow cytometry. The gut microbiota composition and metabolomics were analyzed using 16S recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid pyrosequencing and ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry. Results: LGG administered orally induced marked increases in trabecular bone microarchitecture, cortical bone volume, and biomechanical properties in the LGG+TDF group compared with that in the TDF only group. Moreover, LGG treatment increased intestinal barrier integrity, expanded regulatory T cells, decreased Th17 cells, and downregulated osteoclastogenesis related cytokines in the bone marrow, spleen, and gut. Furthermore, LGG reconstructed the gut microbiota and changed the metabolite composition, especially lysophosphatidylcholine levels. However, the amount of N acetyl leukotriene E4 was the highest in the TDF only group. Conclusion: LGG reconstructed the community structure of the gut microbiota, promoted the expression of lysophosphatidylcholines, and improved intestinal integrity to suppress the TDF induced inflammatory response, which resulted in attenuation of TDF induced bone loss in mice. LGG probiotics may be a safe and effective strategy to prevent and treat TDF induced osteoporosis.

AB With the aging of the population, postmenopausal osteoporosis becomes increasingly widespread and severe as fractures caused by osteoporosis may lead to permanent disabilities and even death. Inspired by extracellular vesicles that participate in bone remodeling, we present a biomimicking polymer vesicle for bone targeted beta estradiol (E 2) delivery. This vesicle is self assembled from a poly(epsilon caprolactone)(28) block poly[(L glutamic acid)(7) stat (L glutamic acid alendronic acid)(4)] (PCL28 b P[Glu(7) stat (Glu ADA)(4)]) diblock copolymer. The alendronic acid (ADA) on the coronas endows the polymer vesicles with a high bone affinity and acts synergistically with E 2 to achieve an enhanced therapeutic effect. As confirmed with ovariectomized osteoporosis rat models, bone loss was significantly reversed as the recovery rates of total BMD (bone mineral density) and trabecular BMD were 70.4% and 99.3%, respectively. Overall, this work provides fresh insight into the treatment of osteoporosis.

TI Loss of receptor activity modifying protein 2 in mice causes placental
   dysfunction and alters PTH1R regulation

AB Receptor activity modifying protein 2 (Ramp2) is a single pass transmembrane protein that heterodimerizes with several family B G protein coupled receptors to alter their function. Ramp2 has been primarily characterized in association with calcitonin receptor like receptor (Calcrl, CLR), forming the canonical receptor complex for the endocrine peptide adrenomedullin (Adm, AM). However, we previously demonstrated that Ramp2(+/ ) female mice display a constellation of endocrine related phenotypes that are distinct from those of Adm (+/ ) and Calcrl(+/ ) mice, implying that RAMP2 has physiological functions beyond its canonical complex. Here, we localize Ramp2 expression in the mouse placenta, finding that Ramp2 is robustly expressed in the fetal labyrinth layer, and then characterize the effects of loss of Ramp2 on placental development. Consistent with the expression pattern of Ramp2 in the placenta, Ramp2( / ) lacentas have a thinner labyrinth layer with significantly fewer trophoblast cells secondary to a reduction in trophoblast proliferation. We also find that absence of Ramp2 leads to failed spiral artery remodeling unaccompanied by changes in the uterine natural killer cell population. Furthermore, we assess changes in gene expression of other RAMP2 associated G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), concluding that Ramp2 loss decreases parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (Pthr1) expression and causes a blunted response to systemic parathyroid hormone (PTH) administration in mice. Ultimately, these studies provide in vivo evidence of a role for RAMP2 in placental development distinct from the RAMP2 CLR/AM signaling paradigm and identify additional pathways underlying the endocrine and fertility defects of the previously characterized Ramp2 heterozygous adult females.

TI Decitabine Inhibits Bone Resorption in Periodontitis by Upregulating
   Anti Inflammatory Cytokines and Suppressing Osteoclastogenesis

AB DNA methylation controls several inflammatory genes affecting bone homeostasis. Hitherto, inhibition of DNA methylation in vivo in the context of periodontitis and osteoclastogenesis has not been attempted. Ligature induced periodontitis in C57BL/6J mice was induced by placing ligature for five days with Decitabine (5 aza 2' deoxycytidine) (1 mg/kg/day) or vehicle treatment. We evaluated bone resorption, osteoclast differentiation by tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and mRNA expression of anti inflammatory molecules using cluster differentiation 14 positive (CD14(+)) monocytes from human peripheral blood. Our data showed that decitabine inhibited bone loss and osteoclast differentiation experimental periodontitis, and suppressed osteoclast CD14(+) human monocytes; and conversely, that it increased bone mineralization in osteoblastic cell line MC3T3 E1 in a concentration dependent manner. In addition to increasing IL10 (interleukin 10), TGFB (transforming growth factor beta 1) in CD14(+) monocytes, decitabine upregulated KLF2 (Kruppel like factor 2) expression. Overexpression of KLF2 protein enhanced the transcription of IL10 and TGFB. On the contrary, site directed mutagenesis of KLF2 binding site in IL10 and TFGB abrogated luciferase activity in HEK293T cells. Decitabine reduces bone loss in a mouse model of periodontitis by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis through the upregulation of anti inflammatory cytokines via KLF2 dependent mechanisms. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors merit further investigation as a possible novel therapy for periodontitis.

AB Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common worldwide mental disorders in children, young and adults. If left untreated, the disorder can continue into adulthood. The abuse of ADHD related drugs to improve mental performance for studying, working and everyday life is also rising. The potentially high number of subjects with controlled or uncontrolled use of such substances increases the impact of possible side effects. It has been shown before that the early ADHD drug methylphenidate influences bone metabolism negatively. This study focused on the influence of three more recent cognitive enhancers, modafinil, atomoxetine and guanfacine, on the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts and on their cell functions, including migration. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were incubated with a therapeutic plasma dosage of modafinil, atomoxetine and guanfacine. Gene expression analyses revealed a high beta 2 adrenoreceptor expression in hMSC, suggesting it as a possible pathway to stimulate action. In bone formation assays, all three cognitive enhancers caused a significant decrease in the mineralized matrix and an early slight reduction of cell viability without triggering apoptosis or necrosis. While there was no effect of the three substances on early differentiation, they showed differing effects on the expression of osterix (OSX), receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the later stages of osteoblast development, suggesting alternative modes of action. All three substances significantly inhibited hMSC migration. This effect could be rescued by a selective beta blocker (Imperial Chemical Industries ICI 118,551) in modafinil and atomoxetine, suggesting mediation via beta 2 receptor stimulation. In conclusion, modafinil, atomoxetine and guanfacine negatively influence hMSC differentiation to bone forming osteoblasts and cell migration through different intracellular pathways.

AB Beta carotene (BC) is a nutrient in vegetables and a precursor of vitamin A. BC has been reported to have anticarcinogenic, antiaging, and antioxidation properties and prevents heart diseases. Recently, BC has gained significant attention due to stimulating effect on osteoblast differentiation. Poly(lactic acid)/hydroxyapatite (PLA/HAp) core shell nanoparticles have been reported earlier with a load capacity of 250% for water insoluble substances, using a surfactant free emulsification method. In this work, PLA/HAp core shell nanoparticles loaded with BC were prepared, and osteoblast differentiation behavior was evaluated. BC was successfully loaded into PLA/HAp core shell nanoparticles with diameters of approximately 30 nm. BC/loaded PLA/HAp core shell nanoparticles stimulated osteoblast differentiation by upregulating collagen type I, osteopontin, and osteocalcin expression. In addition, the gene expression levels of these osteoblasts were significantly larger than those stimulated by PLA/HAp coreshell nanoparticles without BC and cultured in a differential medium (with ascorbic acid and beta glycerophosphate). PLA/HAp core shell nanoparticles showed satisfactory cytocompatibility because they were attached to the osteoblasts. Consequently, BC was effectively delivered to osteoblasts by nanoparticles. These results suggested that BC loaded PLA/HAp core shell nanoparticles could enhance bone formation.

AB Introduction High mortality rates in patients with chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder (CKD MBD) receiving maintenance hemodialysis are largely due to cardiovascular (CV) events. Methods We evaluated associations between MBD parameters, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) concentrations, and clinically adjudicated CV events from the Evaluation of Cinacalcet Hydrochloride Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events (EVOLVE) trial. Patients enrolled in EVOLVE, who had not experienced any study endpoints between randomization and week 20 with evaluable baseline and week 20 values for key laboratory parameters (parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphate, and FGF23), were assessed. We used adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate relative risk of outcomes (primary composite, all cause mortality, and CV events) based on FGF23 and MBD parameters. Laboratory values were modeled with linear terms and using natural cubic splines with two degrees of freedom. Findings For the primary endpoint, patients assessed (N = 2309) were followed up over a mean duration of 3.1 years, during which 1037 CV events (497 deaths, 540 nonfatal events) occurred. Adjusted models showed an association between FGF23 and the risk of CV events. Hazard ratio per log unit of FGF23 at week 20 was 1.09 [95% CI: 1.03 1.16], and the hazard ratio per log unit change in FGF23 from week 0 to week 20 was 1.09 [95% CI: 1.00 1.17]. Discussion Our data highlight FGF23 as an independent CV risk factor and potential biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with CKD MBD receiving maintenance hemodialysis.

AB Background: Low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) is a mechanical stimulus clinically used to promote bone fracture healing. Results: LIPUS suppresses adipogenesis and promotes osteogenesis of mesenchyme stem/progenitor cell lines by inhibiting PPAR2 through ROCK Cot/Tpl2 MEK ERK pathway. Conclusion: LIPUS influences multilineage differentiation of mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells. Significance: LIPUS may be a new clinical approach to chronic bone metabolic disorders, including osteoporosis.
   Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent cells that can differentiate into multilineage cell types, including adipocytes and osteoblasts. Mechanical stimulus is one of the crucial factors in regulating MSC differentiation. However, it remains unknown how mechanical stimulus affects the balance between adipogenesis and osteogenesis. Low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) therapy is a clinical application of mechanical stimulus and facilitates bone fracture healing. Here, we applied LIPUS to adipogenic progenitor cell and MSC lines to analyze how multilineage cell differentiation was affected. We found that LIPUS suppressed adipogenic differentiation of both cell types, represented by impaired lipid droplet appearance and decreased gene expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor 2 (Pparg2) and fatty acid binding protein 4 (Fabp4). LIPUS also down regulated the phosphorylation level of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor 2 protein, inhibiting its transcriptional activity. In contrast, LIPUS promoted osteogenic differentiation of the MSC line, characterized by increased cell calcification as well as inductions of runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and Osteocalcin mRNAs. LIPUS induced phosphorylation of cancer Osaka thyroid oncogene/tumor progression locus 2 (Cot/Tpl2) kinase, which was essential for the phosphorylation of mitogen activated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) and p44/p42 extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs). Notably, effects of LIPUS on both adipogenesis and osteogenesis were prevented by a Cot/Tpl2 specific inhibitor. Furthermore, effects of LIPUS on MSC differentiation as well as Cot/Tpl2 phosphorylation were attenuated by the inhibition of Rho associated kinase. Taken together, these results indicate that mechanical stimulus with LIPUS suppresses adipogenesis and promotes osteogenesis of MSCs through Rho associated kinase Cot/Tpl2 MEK ERK signaling pathway.

AB Background: Growing evidence shows that herb medicines have some anti osteoporotic effects, the mechanism underlying is unknown. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effect of Chinese herb supplements on rats that had osteoporosis like symptom induced by ovariectomy (OVX).
   Methods: OVX or sham operations were performed on virgin Wistar rats at three month old, which were randomly divided into eight groups: sham (sham); OVX control group (OVX); OVX rats with treatments [either diethylstilbestrol (DES) or Semen Astragali Complanati decoction (SACD) or Rhizoma Cibotii decoction (RCD) or Herba Cistanches decoction (HCD) or Semen Allii Tuberosi decoction (SATD)]. Non surgical rats were served as a normal control (NC). The treatments began 4 weeks after surgery, and lasted for 12 weeks. Bone mass and its turnover were analyzed by histomorphometry. Levels of protein and mRNA of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) in osteoblasts (OB) and bone marrow stromal cells (bMSC) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization.
   Results: Compared to OVX control, TBV% in both SACD and RCD groups was increased significantly, while TRS%, TFS%, MAR, and mAR were decreased remarkably in the SACD group, only TRS% decreased dramatically in the RCD group. No significant changes in bone formation were observed in either HCD or SATD groups. OPG levels in both protein and mRNA were reduced consistantly in OB and bMSC from OVX control rats, in contrast, RANKL levels in both protein and mRNA were increased significantly. These effects were substantially reversed by treatments with either DES or SACD or RCD. No significant changes in both OPG and RANKL expression were observed in OB and bMSC from OVX rats treated with SATD and HCD.
   Conclusions: Our study showed that SACD and RCD increased bone formation by stimulating OPG expression and downregulating RANKL expression in OB and bMSC. This suggests that SACD and RCD may be developed as alternative anti osteoporotic agents for therapy of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

AB Aim: Zoledronic acid (ZA), a bisphosphonate, is currently used in combination with chemotherapeutic agents to suppress breast cancer cell proliferation or breast cancer induced osteolysis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ZA combined with a natural anticancer compound plumbagin (PL) against human breast cancer cells in vitro.
   Methods: Human breast cancer MDA MB 231SArfp cells were treated with ZA, PL or a combination of ZA and PL. The cell growth, apoptosis and migration were evaluated using CCK 8 assay, flow cytometry and transwell assay, respectively. The expression of apoptosis related proteins was measured using real time PCR and Western blotting. Synergism was evaluated using Compusyn software, and the combination index (CI) and drug reduction index (DRI) values were determined.
   Results: PL or ZA alone caused mild cytotoxicity (the IC50 value at 24 h was 12.18 and above 100 mu mol/L, respectively). However, the combination of ZA and PL caused a synergistic cytotoxicity (CI=0.26). The DRI values also showed a synergistic effect between PL and ZA, with actual values of 5.52 and 3.59, respectively. Furthermore, PL and ZA synergistically induced apoptosis and inhibited migration of the breast cancer cells. Moreover, the combination of ZA and PL decreased the expression of Notch 1, cleaved PARP, Bcl 2 and Bcl xl, and increased the expression of cleaved caspase 3, CDKN1A and ID1. When the breast cancer cells were transfected with specific siRNA against Notch 1, the combination of ZA and PL markedly increased the expression of Bcl 2.
   Conclusion: Combination of ZA and PL synergistically suppresses human breast cancer MDA MB 231SArfp cells in vitro. PL can inhibit ZA induced activation of the Notch 1 signaling pathway and subsequently reduce the expression of Bcl 2, thus potentiating cancer cell apoptosis.

AB Since lithium (Li+) plays roles in angiogenesis, the localized and controlled release of Li+ ions from bioactive glasses (BGs) represents a promising alternative therapy for the regeneration and repair of tissues with a high degree of vascularization. Here, microparticles from a base 45S5 BG composition containing (wt %) 45% SiO2, 24.5% Na2O, 24.5% CaO, and 6% P2O5, in which Na2O was partially substituted by 5% Li2O (45S5.5Li), were obtained. The results demonstrate that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) have greater migratory and proliferative response and ability to form tubules in vitro after stimulation with the ionic dissolution products (IDPs) of the 45S5.5Li BG. The results also show the activation of the canonical Wnt/beta catenin pathway and the increase in expression of proangiogenic cytokines insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta). We conclude that the IDPs of 45S5.5Li BG would act as useful inorganic agents to improve tissue repair and regeneration, ultimately stimulating HUVECs behavior in the absence of exogenous growth factors.

AB Bone mineral density and fracture rates in children with osteogenesis imperfecta improve with intravenous bisphosphonates. The efficacy of oral bisphosphonates has not been established. This report is an analysis of an open label, prospective, randomized clinical trial of oral compared to intravenous bisphosphonate medications in children with osteogenesis imperfecta. Children were stratified according to bone age, pubertal stage, and type of osteogenesis imperfecta and then randomized to receive intravenous pamidronate, 3 mg/kg over 3 days every 4 months, or oral alendronate 1 mg/kg, from a minimum of 10 mg to a maximum of 20 mg daily. The primary efficacy outcome was change in bone mineral density. Secondary outcomes included change in biomarkers of bone turnover, fracture incidence, and growth rate. Ten children were randomized (6 oral and 4 intravenous). Two other children were assigned to intravenous treatment due to chronic abdominal pain. In each group, three patients had type III/IV osteogenesis imperfecta, while three had type I. All 12 children completed 8 months of therapy; nine completed 12 months. Bone mineral density increased in both oral and intravenous groups equally and beyond that expected with normal growth. All children had a decrease in biochemical markers of bone turnover. Linear growth showed a moderate increase above that for age. There was a non significant decrease in fracture incidence in both groups.

AB Aims: The activity of adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) is susceptible to the physiological conditions of the donor. Therefore, employing ADSCs from donors of advanced age or with diseases for cell therapy necessitates a strategy to enhance therapeutic efficacy before transplantation. This study aims to investigate the impact of supplementing Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) and Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) on ADSC mediated osteogenesis under osteoporotic conditions and to explore the underlying mechanisms of action. Main methods: Adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) obtained from ovariectomized (OVX) rats were cultured ex vivo. These cells were cultured in an osteogenic medium supplemented with FGF2 and HGF and subsequently autologously transplanted into osteoporotic femur defects using Hydroxyapatite Tricalcium Phosphate. The assessment of bone formation was conducted four weeks post transplantation. Key findings: Osteoporosis detrimentally affects the viability and osteogenic differentiation potential of ADSCs, often accompanied by a deficiency in FGF2 and HGF signaling. However, priming with FGF2 and HGF facilitated the formation of immature osteoblasts from OVX ADSCs in vitro, promoting the expression of osteoblastogenic proteins, including Runx 2, osterix, and ALP, during the early phase of osteogenesis. Furthermore, FGF2/HGF priming augmented the levels of VEGF and SDF 1 alpha in the microenvironment of OVX ADSCs under osteogenic induction. Importantly, transplantation of OVX ADSCs primed with FGF2/HGF for 6 days significantly enhanced bone formation compared to non primed cells. The success of bone regeneration was confirmed by the expression of type 1 collagen and osteocalcin in the bone tissue of the deficient area. Significance: Our findings corroborate that priming with FGF2/HGF can improve the differentiation potential of ADSCs. This could be applied in autologous stem cell therapy for skeletal disease in the geriatric population.

TI Nitric oxide contributes to rapid sclerostin protein loss following
   mechanical load

AB In response to mechanical loading of bone, osteocytes produce nitric oxide (NO center dot) and decrease sclerostin protein expression, leading to an increase in bone mass. However, it is unclear whether NO center dot production and sclerostin protein loss are mechanistically linked, and, if so, the nature of their hierarchical relationship within an established mechano transduction pathway. Prior work showed that following fluid shear stress (FSS), osteocytes produce NOX2 derived reactive oxygen species, inducing calcium (Ca2+) influx. Increased intracellular Ca2+ results in calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation, which regulates the lysosomal degradation of sclerostin protein. Here, we extend our discoveries, identifying NO center dot as a regulator of sclerostin degradation downstream of mechano activated CaMKII. Pharmacological inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in Ocy454 osteocyte like cells prevented FSS induced sclerostin protein loss. Conversely, short term treatment with a NO center dot donor in Ocy454 cells or isolated murine long bones was sufficient to induce the rapid decrease in sclerostin protein abundance, independent of changes in Sost gene expression. Ocy454 cells express all three NOS genes, and transfection with siRNAs targeting eNOS/Nos3 was sufficient to prevent FSS induced loss of sclerostin protein, while siRNAs targeting iNOS/Nos2 mildly blunted the loss of sclerostin but did not reach statistical significance. Similarly, siRNAs targeting both eNOS/Nos3 and iNOS/Nos2 prevented FSS induced NO center dot production. Together, these data show iNOS/Nos2 and eNOS/Nos3 are the primary producers of FSS dependent NO center dot, and that NO center dot is necessary and sufficient for sclerostin protein control. Further, selective inhibition of elements within this sclerostin controlling mechano transduction pathway indicated that NO center dot production occurs downstream of CaMKII activation. Targeting Camk2d and Camk2g with siRNA in Ocy454 cells prevented NO center dot production following FSS, indicating that CaMKII is needed for NO center dot production. However, NO center dot donation (1min) resulted in a significant increase in CaMKII activation, suggesting that NO center dot may have the ability to tune CaMKII response. Together, these data support that CaMKII is necessary for, and may be modulated by NO center dot, and that the interaction of these two signals is involved in the control of sclerostin protein abundance, consistent with a role in bone anabolic responses.

AB Osthole is a bioactive coumarin derivative and has been reported to be able to enhance bone formation and improve fracture healing. However, the molecular mechanism of Osthole in bone fracture healing has not been fully defined. In this study we determined if Osthole enhances bone fracture healing through activation of BMP2 signaling in mice. We performed unilateral open transverse tibial fracture procedure in 10 week old C57BL/6 mice which were treated with or without Osthole. Our previous studies demonstrated that chondrocyte BMP signaling is required for bone fracture healing, in this study we also performed tibial fracture procedure in Cre negative and Col2 Cre; Bmp2(flox/flox) conditional knockout (KO) mice (Bmp2(Col2Cre)) to determine if Osthole enhances fracture healing in a BMP2 dependent manner. Fracture callus tissues were collected and analyzed by X ray, micro CT (mu CT), histology, histomorphometry, immunohistochemistry (IHC), biomechanical testing and quantitative gene expression analysis. In addition, mouse chondrogenic ATDC5 cells were cultured with or without Osthole and the expression levels of chondrogenic marker genes were examined. The results demonstrated that Osthole promotes bone fracture healing in wild type (WT) or Cre control mice. In contrast, Osthole failed to promote bone fracture healing in Bmp2(Col2Cre) conditional KO mice. In the mice receiving Osthole treatment, expression of cartilage marker genes was significantly increased. We conclude that Osthole could promote bone strength and enhance fracture healing by activation of BMP2 signaling. Osthole may be used as an alternative approach in the orthopaedic clinic for the treatment of fracture healing.

TI A DOTA based bisphosphonate with an albumin binding moiety for delayed
   body clearance for bone targeting

AB Radiolabeled bisphosphonates are commonly used in the diagnosis and therapy of bone metastases. Blood clearance of bisphosphonates is usually fast and only 30% 50% of the injected activity is retained in the skeleton, while most of the activity is excreted by the urinary tract. A longer blood circulation may enhance accumulation of bisphosphonate compounds in bone metastases. Therefore, a chemically modified macrocyclic bisphosphonate derivative with an additional human albumin binding entity was synthesized and pharmacokinetics of its complex was evaluated. The DOTA bisphosphonate conjugate BPAMD was compared against the novel DOTAGA derived albumin binding bisphosphonate DOTAGA(428 D Lys)M BP (L1). The ligands were labeled with Ga 68(III) and were evaluated in in vitro binding studies to hydroxyapatite (HA) as well as to human serum albumin. The compounds were finally compared in in vivo PET and ex vivo organ distribution studies in small animals over 6 h. Binding studies revealed a consistent affinity of both bisphosphonate tracers to HA. Small animal PET and ex vivo organ distribution studies showed longer blood retention of [Ga 68]L1. [Ga 68]BPAMD is initially more efficiently bound to the bone but skeletal accumulation of the modified compound and [Ga 68]BPAMD equalized at 6 h p.i. Ratios of femur epiphyseal plate to ordinary bone showed to be more favorable for [Ga 68]L1 than for [Ga 68]BPAMD due to the longer circulation time of the new tracer. Thus, the chemical modification of BPAMD toward an albumin binding bisphosphonate, L1, resulted in a novel PET tracer which conserves advantages of both functional groups within one and the same molecule. The properties of this new diagnostic tracer are expected to be preserved in Lu 177 therapeutic agent with the same ligand (a theranostic pair). (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disease that causes pain, morbidity, and disability. The main strategy for OA treatment focuses on inflammation suppression, inhibition of osteoclastogenesis, and protection of articular cartilage. These functions cannot be performed effectively by monotherapy. Therefore, an effective drug delivery system is required, capable of containing and controlling the efflux of various drugs to alleviate osteoclastogenesis, protect cartilage and subchondral bone, and suppress inflammation. In this work, an encapsulation system is constructed using a self healing chitosan hydrogel and allocated compound drugs. The self healing gel is composed of branched functionalized chitosan, created by simultaneously using polycaprolactone polyethylene glycol azide as a block polymer and the host guest assembly of beta cyclodextrin and adamantane. Inhibitors of the NFkB pathway are loaded into the cavities of beta cyclodextrin and the spring like structure of the block polymer, which can be rapidly released upon joint friction (due to the reassembly of beta cyclodextrin and adamantane by shear stress and the stretch of the block polymer). In vitro experiments using BMMs and the ATDC5 cell line confirm that the developed hydrogel can simultaneously suppress osteoclastogenesis and induce chondrogenesis. Additionally, a model of knee arthritis in C57 mice was used to confirm that this double crosslinked encapsulation system can lubricate the knee joint surface and provide adequate protection on demand through shear responsive drug release.

AB Large bone defects requiring long term osteosynthetic stabilization or repeated surgeries show a considerable rate of infection. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been successfully used to enhance bone regeneration, but their powerful immunomodulatory effects may impose an enhanced risk for osteomyelitis development. In order to unravel whether implantation of MSCs aggravates a simultaneous bone infection, a hydrogel supported osteomyelitis ostectomy model was developed in which rats received a femoral bone defect with rigid plate fixation. After fibrin assisted transfer of Staphylococcus aureus (SA), effects of MSC implantation on osteomyelitis development were quantified over 3 4 weeks.
   All SA infected animals developed an acute local osteomyelitis with significantly increased blood neutrophil count, abscess formation and bone destruction. MSC treatment of infected defects aggravated osteomyelitis according to a significantly elevated osteomyelitis score and enhanced distal bone loss with spongy alteration of cortical bone architecture. Increased attraction of macrophages, osteoclasts and regulation of pro  and anti inflammatory mediators were potential MSC actions.
   Overall trophic actions of MSCs implanted into non sterile bone defects may enhance an infection and/or exacerbate osteomyelitis. Studies on antibiotic carrier augmentation or antibiotic treatment are warranted to decide whether MSC implantation is a safe and promising therapy for orthopedic implant stabilized bone defects at high risk for development of infection.

TI MACC1 Contributes to the Development of Osteosarcoma Through Regulation

AB Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most prevalent human bone malignancy, and presents a global annual morbidity of approximately five cases per million. Notably, precise and efficient targeted therapy has become the most promising strategy for the treatment of OS; however, there is still an urgent need for the identification of suitable therapeutic targets. Metastasis associated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1) was first identified in colon tumors by differential display RT PCR, and was shown to be involved in the regulation of colon tumor growth and metastasis through the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c Met signaling pathway. Additionally, MACC1 overexpression has been reported to induce the growth of several types of cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme and gastric cancer. However, whether MACC1 also plays a role in the progression of OS remains unclear. In this study, we found that MACC1 was highly expressed in human OS tissues, as well as in U 2OS and MG 63 cells, when compared with normal tissues and osteoblasts, respectively. Our data further indicated that MACC1 expression was correlated with several clinicopathological features of OS. Through in vitro assays, we found that MACC1 depletion markedly suppressed the proliferative ability of both OS cells and endothelial cells, and inhibited the angiogenic capacity of endothelial cells. Similarly, MACC1 depletion inhibited tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis in mice. Mechanistically, we found that MACC1 could bind to the MET promoter, and enhanced the proliferation of both OS cells and endothelial cells through the HGF/c Met signaling pathway. Furthermore, we show that MACC1 also promoted angiogenesis by regulating microtubule dynamics, thereby promoting the progression of OS. Our results indicate that MACC1 may be a new and promising therapeutic target for the treatment of OS.

AB The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of glucocorticoid therapy (GCCT) on Wnt signalling antagonists (sderostin and Dkk 1) and their relationship with bone turnover. 25 patients (8 M/17 F, aged 48 +/  19 yrs) recently initiating GCCT (>= 7.5 mg/day, <= 6 months) were prospectively included. Bone turnover markers (bone formation: P1NP, osteocalcin [OC], bone ALP; bone resorption: sCTx) and Wnt antagonists (serum sclerostin and Dkk 1) were assessed in all patients (short term and 12 months after initiating GCCT). Bone mineral density (BMD) was performed to assess osteoporosis. The results were compared with 60 healthy controls. At short term patients on GCCT showed a significant decrease in bone formation markers versus controls (P1NP: 19 +/  9 vs. 43 16 ng/mL, p < 0.001; OC: 7.4 +/  2.4 vs. 18.4 +/  5.2 ng/mL, p = 0.001) and in Dkk 1 levels (24.5 +/  20.1 vs. 36.8 +/  13.7 pmol/L, p = 0.008) with similar sclerostin values (41.8 +/  21.8 vs. 42.1 +/  13.9 pmol/L, p = 0.950). Sderostin correlated positively with GCCT doses (r = 0.449, p = 0.024) and lumbar BMD (r = 0.424, p = 0.035), and negatively with bone ALP (r =  0398, p = 0.049). A progressive decrease in Dkk 1 levels was observed at 12 months, (19.1 +/  14.9, p = 0.001), whereas sclerostin increased compared to controls (48.9 +/  11.6, p = 0.045). In conclusion, the effect of GCCT on the serum levels of the Wnt signalling parameters differs depending on the antagonist evaluated. Whereas sclerostin values increased and showed a relationship with the dose and bone AP, Dkk 1 levels decreased throughout the study suggesting a counter regulatory mechanism of this factor thereby reducing the deleterious effect of GCCT in the bone.

TI Dynamic polarization shifting from M1 to M2 macrophages in reduced

AB Denosumab related osteonecrosis of the jaw (DRONJ), which mainly occurs in cancer patients receiving anti receptor activator NF kappaB ligand (RANKL) antibody, reduces oral health related quality of life. However, the exact mechanisms of and definitive treatment strategies for DRONJ remain unknown. We hypothesized that cessation of denosumab heals and/or ameliorates DRONJ, since it is a protein based antibody agent, although stopping denosumab should be avoided in clinical situations. Therefore, the aims of this study were: 1) to create a healing and/or amelioration murine model of DRONJ like lesions induced by chemotherapy/anti RANKL antibody (mAb) combination therapy and tooth extraction; and 2) to investigate histopathology and immunopathology in the extraction sockets by comparing the murine model of DRONJ like lesions with the amelioration/healing model of DRONJ like lesions. Eight week old, female C57B/6J mice received chemotherapeutic drug (cyclophosphamide: CY) and mAb combination therapy (CY/mAb) with tooth extraction. Open wounds were sustained in CY/mAb treated mice at 2 and 4 weeks post extraction. Impaired socket healing was diagnosed as CY/mAb related ONJ like lesions at 3 weeks post extraction in this study. Next, mAb was discontinued for 2 and 4 weeks after diagnosis of CY/mAb related ONJ like lesions. mAb cessation for 2 weeks induced partial osseous wound healing and significantly improved soft tissue wound healing of the extraction sockets. Anti angiogenesis and normal lymphangiogenesis with CY/mAb combination therapy was not changed by mAb discontinuation. However, mAb cessation for 2 weeks significantly increased the number of CD38(+)F4/80(+) M1 and CD163(+)F4/80(+) M2 macrophages, which significantly increased the M2/M1 ratio in the connective tissue of extraction sockets. No direct effects of mAb on macrophages were noted both in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, the developed healing and/or amelioration murine model of CY/mAb related ONJ like lesions is a useful tool to investigate the histopathology and immunopathology of DRONJ in humans. Dynamic polarization shifting from M1 to M2 macrophages induced by mAb cessation may play an important role in wound healing, rather than angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, in DRONJ.

AB The relaxed complex scheme is an in silico drug screening method that accounts for receptor flexibility using molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we used this approach combined with similarity searches and experimental inhibition assays to identify several low micromolar, non bisphosphonate inhibitors, bisamidines, of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), an enzyme targeted by some anticancer and antimicrobial agents and for the treatment of bone resorption diseases. This novel class of farnesyl diphosphate synthase inhibitors have more drug like properties than existing bisphosphonate inhibitors, making them interesting pharmaceutical leads.

AB Osteomyelitis is a limb  and life threatening orthopedic infection predominantly caused by Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Bone infections are extremely challenging to treat clinically. Therefore, we have been designing, synthesizing, and testing novel antibiotic conjugates to target bone infections. This class of conjugates comprises bone binding bisphosphonates as biochemical vectors for the delivery of antibiotic agents to bone minerals (hydroxyapatite). In the present study, we utilized a real time impedance based assay to study the growth of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms over time and to test the antimicrobial efficacy of our novel conjugates on the inhibition of biofilm growth in the presence and absence of hydroxyapatite. We tested early and newer generation quinolone antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, sitafloxacin, and nemonoxacin) and several bisphosphonate conjugated versions of these antibiotics (bisphosphonate carbamate sitafloxacin (BCS), bisphosphonate carbamate nemonoxacin (BCN), etidronate carbamate ciprofloxacin (ECC), and etidronate carbamate moxifloxacin (ECX)) and found that they were able to inhibit Staphylococcus aureus biofilms in a dose dependent manner. Among the conjugates, the greatest antimicrobial efficacy was observed for BCN with an MIC of 1.48 mu g/mL. The conjugates demonstrated varying antimicrobial activity depending on the specific antibiotic used for conjugation, the type of bisphosphonate moiety, the chemical conjugation scheme, and the presence or absence of hydroxyapatite. The conjugates designed and tested in this study retained the bone binding properties of the parent bisphosphonate moiety as confirmed using high performance liquid chromatography. They also retained the antimicrobial activity of the parent antibiotic in the presence or absence of hydroxyapatite, albeit at lower levels due to the nature of their chemical modification. These findings will aid in the optimization and testing of this novel class of drugs for future applications to pharmacotherapy in osteomyelitis.

TI The lack of EphB3 receptor prevents bone loss in mouse models of
   osteoporosis
SO JOURNAL OF BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCH

AB Bone homeostasis is a complex process in which some Eph kinase receptors and their ephrin ligands appear to be involved. In the present study, we address this issue by examining, both in vitro and in vivo, the role of EphB2 and EphB3 in mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (MSC) differentiation into bone tissue. This was first evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT qPCR) and histological staining in MSCs cultured in specific mediums revealing that although EphB2 /  MSCs mainly expressed pro adipogenic transcription factors, EphB3 /  MSCs showed abundant osteogenic transcripts, such as Runx2, Msx2, and Sp7. To clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms, we found that the lack of EphB3 signaling alters the genetic profile of differentiating MSCs, reducing the expression of many inhibitory molecules and antagonists of the BMP signaling pathway, and increasing Bmp7 expression, a robust bone inductor. Then, to confirm the osteogenic role of EphB3 in vivo, we studied the condition of 2 mouse models of induced bone loss (ovariectomy or long term glucocorticoid treatment). Interestingly, in both models, both WT and EphB2 /  mice equally developed the disease but EphB3 /  mice did not exhibit the typical bone loss, nor an increase in urine Ca2+ or blood serum CTX 1. This phenotype in EphB3 KO mice could be due to their significantly higher proportions of osteoprogenitor cells and preosteoblasts, and their lower number of osteoclasts, as compared with WT and EphB2 KO mice. Thus, we conclude that EphB3 acts as a negative regulator of the osteogenic differentiation, and its absence prevents bone loss in mice subjected to ovariectomy or dexamethasone treatment.
   Osteoporosis affects more than 200 million people, mostly women. Our work shows that the EphB3 receptor restricts bone formation, and its absence prevents bone loss in osteoporotic mice. The bone protection observed in EphB3 deficient mice is due to the presence of more bone forming cells and fewer bone degrading cells. Molecularly, we found that when there's no EphB3 in mesenchymal stem cells, some bone promoting genes are increased while many inhibitors are reduced. Therefore, this receptor could become a key target for new therapies that would help to improve the quality of life for those suffering from bone diseases. We're really excited to share our findings with a broad audience, including patients, healthcare professionals, researchers, and the life sciences industry.

AB Delayed healing and nonhealing of bone defects or resected bone sites remains an important clinical concern in the biomedical field. Osteosarcoma is one of the most common types of primary bone cancers. Among calcium phosphates, hydroxyapatite (HA) and tricalcium phosphate (TCP) are the most widely used in various biomedical applications for bone reconstruction and replacement. In this study, crocin, saffron's natural bioactive and anti inflammatory molecule, and bicarbonate, a neutralizing agent, were directly loaded onto HA disks to evaluate their in vitro release and effect on human osteoblast and osteosarcoma cell lines. This was assessed through release, initial toxicity, drug optimization, final toxicity studies and in vivo anti inflammatory assessment through H&E indexing. It is hypothesized that the release of crocin, bicarbonate, and the dual release of both agents will decrease osteosarcoma cellular viability with no effect on osteoblast cells. A plateaued release of crocin and bicarbonate was achieved over seven weeks in physiological and acidic environments, where bicarbonate was shown to modulate the release of crocin. Through morphological characterization and MTT assay analysis, bicarbonate showed no toxicity to human fetal osteoblast (hFOB) cells and crocin significantly enhanced osteoblast proliferation. Through drug concentration optimization, all drug loaded samples decreased human osteosarcoma (MG 63) viability by 50% compared to control samples by Day 11, with clear changes in cell spreading and morphology. Moreover, 3D printed TCP scaffolds loaded with crocin and bicarbonate were tested in vivo in order to assess their preliminary effects on inflammation in a rat distal femur model at 4 days. Lower inflammatory cellular recruitment was achieved in the presence of crocin and bicarbonate, compared to the control. These results suggest a pro apoptotic mechanism against osteosarcoma as well as anti inflammatory properties of crocin and bicarbonate, elucidating a potential application for osteosarcoma regulation and wound healing for bone tissue regeneration applications.

AB Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been revealed to be effective in the treatment of open fractures, although the underlying mechanism is not clear. This article aimed to investigate the effects of NPWT on muscle derived stem cell (MDSC) osteoblastic differentiation and the related potential mechanism. The cell proliferation rate was substantially increased in NPWT treated MDSCs in comparison with a static group for 3days. There was no observable effect on the apoptosis of MDSC treated with NPWT compared with the control group for 3days. The expression levels of HIF 1 alpha, BMP 2, COL I, OST and OPN were increased on days 3, 7 and 14, but the expression level of Runx2 was increased on days 3 and 7 in the NPWT group. Pre treatment, the specific inhibitors were added into the MDSCs treated with NPWT and the control group. ALP activity and mineralization were reduced by inhibiting the ERK1/2, p38 and JNK pathways. The expression levels of Runx2, COL I, OST and OPN genes and proteins were also decreased using the specific MAPK pathway inhibitors on days 3, 7 and 14. There were no significant effects on the expression of BMP 2 except on day 3. However, the expressions of the HIF 1 alpha gene and protein slightly increased when the JNK pathway was inhibited. Therefore, NPWT promotes the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MDSCs through the MAPK pathway.

AB Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by fibroblasts ossification. However, effective drug therapy for AS is lacking. As an antidiabetic drug, metformin has demonstrated an antiosteogenic effect on osteoblasts in vitro. And it is also a kind of specific agonists for adenosine 5 monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is blocked in the process of AS. Given the role in antiosteogenesis and AMPK activating, metformin was investigated of its effect on fibroblasts harvested from capsular ligament of patients with femoral neck fracture and AS. Osteogenic specific makers (Alp, Bglap, Runx2, Bmp2, and Col1) in fibroblasts administered with metformin (20g/mL) were detected by ALP staining, alizarin red staining, qPCR, and Western blotting after 7 and 14 days of culture. Inflammation genes (il1  and il6) and pathway (Pi3k, Akt, and Ampk) associated markers were also evaluated. Our results showed that osteogenic specific markers were greatly downregulated and ossification was effectively inhibited in AS fibroblasts after addition of metformin. Levels of inflammation markers were also decreased by metformin. Thus, metformin exerts potent effect on suppression of ossification and inflammation in AS fibroblasts via the activation of Pi3k/Akt and AMPK pathways, which may be developed as a potential agent for treatment of AS.

AB Background/purpose: Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) are an emerging source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for bone tissue regeneration and engineering. In bone regen eration using transplanted MSCs, the extracellular environment or co injected drugs can affect their success or failure. In this study, we investigated the effects and signaling mechanisms of lidocaine on osteogenic differentiation of hDPSCs after inducing inflammatory conditions with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF a).Materials and methods: To investigate the effect of lidocaine on the osteogenic differentiation of LPS/TNF a treated hDPSCs, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Alizarin red S (ARS) staining were conducted. The expression of osteogenesis related genes was assessed using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The expression of mitogen activated protein kinases was analyzed to evaluate the effect of lidocaine on osteogenic dif ferentiation of LPS/TNF a treated hDPSCs.Results: Various concentrations of lidocaine (0.05, 0.2, and 1 mM) further decreased ALP and ARS staining of LPS/TNF a treated hDPSCs. Similarly, the mRNA and protein expression of osteogenesis related genes was suppressed via lidocaine treatment in LPS/TNF a treated hDPSCs. Lidocaine treatment downregulated the protein expression of p ERK and p JNK in LPS/TNF a treated hDPSCs.Conclusion: Lidocaine intensified the inhibition of osteogenic differentiation on inflammation  induced hDPSCs by inhibiting the ERK and JNK signaling pathways. This in vitro study suggested that lidocaine may have an inhibitory effect on bone regeneration.& COPY; 2022 Association for Dental Sciences of the Republic of China.

AB Objective and BackgroundHuman periodontal ligament mesenchymal stem cells (hPDLMSCs) are reported to be responsible for homeostasis and regeneration of periodontal tissue. Although hPDLMSCs are commonly cultured in monolayers, monolayer cultures have been reported as inferior to 3 dimensional cultures such as spheroids, which are spherical clusters of cells formed by self assembly. The aim of this study was to examine the osteogenic phenotype of spheroids of hPDLMSCs, compared with monolayer cultures of hPDLMSC, in vitro and in vivo.
   Material and MethodsSpheroids were formed using microwell chips that were tagged with polyethylene glycol. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) markers in hPDLMSC spheroids were examined by flow cytometer. Real time polymerase chain reaction analysis was examined to measure the expressions of stemness markers and osteogenesis related genes in monolayer and spheroid cultured hPDLMSCs. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed to confirm protein expressions of stemness markers in PDLMSC spheroids. Nodule formation assay, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay and transplantation assay in a mouse calvarial defect model were performed to confirm the osteogenic potential of hPDLMSC spheroids. To elucidate the mechanism of spheroid culture enhanced osteogenesis in hPDLMSCs with osteoinductive medium (OIM), a small interfering RNA (siRNA) assay targeted with secreted frizzled related protein 3 (SFRP3) was examined. The levels of SFRP3 expression in monolayer and spheroid cultured hPDLMSCs with OIM were measured by real time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting analysis. ALP gene expression and ALP activity were examined in SFRP3 deficient hPDLMSC spheroids.
   ResultsThe hPDLMSC spheroids expressed MSC markers, which were similar to hPDLMSCs grown in monolayer cultures. Intriguingly, the protein and mRNA expressions of transcription factors that regulate stemness were significantly increased in hPDLMSC spheroids, compared with hPDLMSCs in monolayer cultures. Nodule formation by hPDLMSCs was significantly increased in spheroid cultures grown with OIM, compared with monolayer cultured hPDLMSCs. ALP activity and expression of osteogenesis related genes were also significantly enhanced in hPDLMSC spheroids, compared with monolayer cultures. Treatment with hPDLMSC spheroids significantly enhanced new bone formation in a murine calvarial defect model, compared with hPDLMSCs in monolayer culture. Finally, to elucidate mechanisms by which spheroid culture enhances ALP activation in hPDLMSCs grown with OIM, an siRNA assay was used to manipulate expression of SFRP3, a Wnt signaling antagonist. Knockdown of SFRP3 suppressed ALP gene expression in hPDLMSCs grown in OIM; further, it suppressed ALP activity in spheroid culture. These data suggest that the enhancement of osteogenic potential in hPDLMSC spheroids is regulated through SFRP3 mediated ALP activation.
   ConclusionSpheroid cultures of hPDLMSCs may be a novel and useful tool in regenerative medicine.

AB Chronic inflammation is triggered by numerous diseases such as osteoarthritis, Crohn's disease and cancer. The control of the pro inflammatory process can prevent, mitigate and/or inhibit the evolution of these diseases. Therefore, anti inflammatory drugs have been studied as possible compounds to act in these diseases. This paper proposes a computational analysis of eugenol in relation to aspirin and diclofenac and analyzing the ADMET profile and interactions with COX 2 and 5 LOX enzymes, important enzymes in the signaling pathway of pro inflammatory processes. Through the analysis of ADMET in silico, it was found that the pharmacokinetic results of eugenol are similar to NSAIDs, such as diclofenac and aspirin. Bioinformatics analysis using coupling tests showed that eugenol can bind to COX 2 and 5 LOX. These results corroborate with different findings in the literature that demonstrate anti inflammatory activity with less gastric irritation, bleeding and ulcerogenic side effects of eugenol. The results of bioinformatics reinforce studies that try to propose eugenol as an anti inflammatory compound that can act in the COX 2/5 LOX pathways, replacing some NSAIDs in different diseases.

AB Background: Zoledronic acid (ZA) reduces locoregional and distant metastases in estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer patients. Since ZA rapidly concentrates in the bone following i.v. administration, we hypothesized that this phenomenon involves the mechanism of action of ZA in bone tissue.
   Materials and methods: Migration assays were carried out in fibronectin coated Boyden chambers. Activation of signaling proteins was analyzed with a phosphoprotein array. Chemokines and growth factors were measured by immunoassays and real time PCR.
   Results: ZA significantly reduced in bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) the activation of AKT and mitogen activated protein kinase and their ability to migrate. Conditioned medium (CM) from ZA treated MSCs showed a reduced capacity to promote the migration of ER positive MCF 7 breast cancer cells as compared with CM from untreated MSCs. The levels of the chemokine (C C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5, also known as RANTES   Regulated upon Activation, Normal T cell Expressed, and Secreted) and interleukin (IL) 6 were significantly reduced in MSC CM following treatment with ZA. Anti RANTES and anti IL 6 antibodies almost completely abolished the migration of MCF 7 cells induced by MSC CM. Recombinant RANTES and IL 6 significantly induced MCF 7 cell migration and their combination showed a cooperative effect. Similar results were observed in different breast cancer cell lines.
   Conclusion: ZA might exert its antitumor activity by inhibiting MSC migration and blocking MSCs' secretion of factors involved in breast cancer progression.

AB Introduction: Stem cells are considered an important resource for tissue repair and regeneration. Their utilization in regenerative medicine will be aided by mechanistic insight into their responsiveness to external stimuli. It is likely that, similar to all other cells, an initial determinant of stem cell responsiveness to external stimuli is the organization of signaling molecules in cell membrane rafts. The clustering of signaling molecules in these cholesterol rich membrane microdomains can affect the activity, specificity, cross talk and amplification of cell signaling. Membrane rafts fall into two broad categories, non caveolar and caveolar, based on the absence or presence, respectively, of caveolin scaffolding proteins. We have recently demonstrated that caveolin 1 (Cav 1) expression increases during, and knockdown of Cav 1 expression enhances, osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The increase in Cav 1 expression observed during osteogenesis is likely a negative feedback mechanism. We hypothesize that focal adhesion signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt signaling may be negatively regulated by Cav 1 during human MSC osteogenesis.
   Methods: Human bone marrow MSCs were isolated from femoral heads obtained after total hip arthroplasty. MSCs were incubated in standard growth medium alone or induced to osteogenically differentiate by the addition of supplements (beta glycerophosphate, ascorbic acid, dexamethasone, and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D 3). The activation of and requirement for PI3K/Akt signaling in MSC osteogenesis were assessed by immunoblotting for phosphorylated Akt, and treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and Akt siRNA, respectively. The influences of Cav 1 and cholesterol membrane rafts on PI3K/Akt signaling were investigated by treatment with Cav 1 siRNA, methyl beta cyclodextrin, or cholesterol oxidase, followed by cellular sub fractionation and/or immunoblotting for phosphorylated Akt.
   Results: LY294002 and Akt siRNA inhibited MSC osteogenesis. Methyl beta cyclodextrin, which disrupts all membrane rafts, inhibited osteogenesis. Conversely, Cav 1 siRNA and cholesterol oxidase, which displaces Cav 1 from caveolae, enhanced Akt signaling induced by osteogenic supplements. In control cells, phosphorylated Akt began to accumulate in caveolae after 10 days of osteogenic differentiation.
   Conclusions: PI3K/Akt signaling is a key pathway required for human MSC osteogenesis, and it is likely that localization of active Akt in non caveolar and caveolar membrane rafts positively and negatively contributes to osteogenesis, respectively.

AB There have been no studies investigating the effects of the mechanical stimulation provided by Low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) treatment on periodontal disease accompanying bone loss. LIPUS is known to accelerate mineralization and bone regeneration, but the precise cellular mechanism is unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of LIPUS on osteogenesis by examining the effect of LIPUS stimulation on cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) activity, osteogenesis related gene expression, and mineralized nodule formation in a rat osteosarcoma cell line. The cells were cultured in medium with or without the addition of LIPUS stimulation. The ultrasound signal consisted of 1.5 MHz at an intensity of 30 mW/cm(2) for 20 min for all cultures. LIPUS stimulation did not affect the rate of cell proliferation. ALPase activity was increased at day 7 of culture after LIPUS stimulation. Real time PCR analysis indicated that LIPUS significantly increased the expression of mRNA for the transcription factors Runx2, Msx2, Dlx5, and Osterix and for bone sialoprotein, whereas the mRNA expression of AJ18 was significantly reduced. The mineralized nodule formation and the calcium content in mineralized nodules were markedly increased on day 14 of culture after LIPUS stimulation. Our study demonstrates that LIPUS stimulation directly affects osteogenic cells, leading to mineralized nodule formation. In view of the widespread use of LIPUS for the clinical therapy of periodontal disease, it is likely that LIPUS has an important influence on key functional activities of osteoblasts in alveolar bone.

AB Objective: Between 65% and 75% of patients with metastatic breast cancer will have decreased 5 year survival and increased morbidity due to cancer relapse in bone. At this stage of disease treatment is palliative, but tumor targeted compounds could add to the benefits of anti resorptive agents, improving clinical outcome. Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are overexpressed in many tumors and second mitochondria derived activator of caspases (Smac) mimetics have been designed to antagonize IAPs. In this work we explored the use of AT 406, a Smac mimetic, to target the tumor compartment of bone metastases.
   Methods: Effect of AT 406 on cancer cells apoptosis, expression of IAPs and osteogenic potential was addressed in vitro using the RANK positive MDA MB 231 breast cancer cell line. Effect of AT 406 on osteoclastogenesis was determined by inducing the differentiation of the RAW 2647 mouse monocytic cell line. Osteoclastogenesis was measured by TRAP staining and TRACP 5b quantification.
   Results: AT 406 increased apoptosis in MDA MB 231 breast cancer cells in vitro, and activation of RANK pathway improved this effect. RANKL stimuli induced a strong increase in c 1AP2. AT 406 increased osteoclast differentiation and activity, by up regulating the osteogenic transcription factor Nfatcl, but also increased the apoptosis of mature osteoclasts in the absence of RANKL.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that despite the anti  tumoral effect of AT 406, its use in the context of bone metastatic disease needs to be carefully monitored for the induction of increased bone resorption. We also hypothesize that the combination of AT 406 with anti RANKL directed therapies could have a beneficial effect, especially in RANK positive tumors. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Mutation of the MAPK7 gene was related to human scoliosis. Mapk7 regulated the development of limb bones and skulls in mice. However, the role of MAPK7 in vertebral devel opment is still unclear. In this study, we constructed Col2a1 cre; Mapk7f/f transgenic mouse model to delete Mapk7 in cartilage, which displayed kyphosis and osteopenia. Mechanistically, Mapk7 loss decreased MEF2C expression and thus activated PTEN to oppose PI3K/AKT signaling in vertebral growth plate chondrocytes, which impaired chondrocyte hypertrophy and attenu ated vertebral ossification. In vivo, systemic pharmacological activation of AKT rescued impaired chondrocyte hypertrophy and alleviated mouse vertebral defects caused by Mapk7 deficiency. Our study firstly clarified the mechanism by which MAPK7 was involved in vertebral development, which might contribute to understanding the pathology of spinal deformity and provide a basis for the treatment of developmental disorders of the spine. 2023 The Authors.

AB Background: Low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS, a form of mechanical stimulation) can promote skeletal muscle functional repair, but a lack of mechanistic understanding of its relationship and tissue regeneration limits progress in this field. We investigated the hypothesis that specific energy levels of LIPUS mediates skeletal muscle regeneration by modulating the inflammatory microenvironment. Methods: To address these gaps, LIPUS irritation was applied in vivo for 5 min at two different intensities (30mW/cm2 and 60mW/cm2) in next 7 consecutive days, and the treatment begun at 24h after air drop induced contusion injury. In vitro experiments, LIPUS irritation was applied at three different intensities (30mW/cm2, 45mW/cm2, and 60mW/cm2) for 2 times 24h after introduction of LPS in RAW264.7. Then, we comprehensively assessed the functional and histological parameters of skeletal muscle injury in mice and the phenotype shifting in macrophages through molecular biological methods and immunofluorescence analysis both in vivo and in vitro. Results: We reported that LIPUS therapy at intensity of 60mW/cm2 exhibited the most significant differences in functional recovery of contusion injured muscle in mice. The comprehensive functional tests and histological analysis in vivo indirectly and directly proved the effectiveness of LIPUS for muscle recovery. Through biological methods and immunofluorescence analysis both in vivo and in vitro, we found that this improvement was attributable in part to the clearance of M1 macrophages populations and the increase in M2 subtypes with the change of macrophage mediated factors. Depletion of macrophages in vivo eliminated the therapeutic effects of LIPUS, indicating that improvement in muscle function was the result of M2 shifted macrophage polarization. Moreover, the M2 inducing effects of LIPUS were proved partially through the WNT pathway by upregulating FZD5 expression and enhancing beta catenin nuclear translocation in macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. The inhibition and augment of WNT pathway in vitro further verified our results. Conclusion: LIPUS at intensity of 60mW/cm2 could significantly promoted skeletal muscle regeneration through shifting macrophage phenotype from M1 to M2. The ability of LIPUS to direct macrophage polarization may be a beneficial target in the clinical treatment of many injuries and inflammatory diseases.

AB Long term glucocorticoids administration inhibits bone mineralization and has a negative impact on basic cellular mechanisms that are critical in the development and maintenance of bone strength. Steroids can cause osteoporosis in children and have a negative impact on bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD). We aim to determine the BMD of children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) who are on corticosteroids therapy. This cross sectional study included 90 patients on corticosteroids therapy and 50 apparently healthy age and sex matched children served as a control group. Renal functions, bone biochemistry, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were measured in patients and controls. BMD was measured at the lumbar spinal region (L2 L4) using Dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan in both patients and controls groups. Serum PTH, phosphorous, and alkaline phosphatase levels were significantly higher in patients than in controls. There was a statistically significant reduction in blood calcium levels in patients compared to controls. Osteopenia was diagnosed by DEXA scan in 24 patients (26.7%) and osteoporosis in 12 patients (13.3 %). There was a statistically significant decline in BMD z score, BMD, and BMC in patients compared to the healthy group. Patients with INS on corticosteroids treatment have a lower BMD than their peers. Pediatric INS patients had a high prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis as measured by DEXA. Steroid therapy has a deleterious impact on bone mineralization in children with INS.

AB Glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis (GIO) is one of the most common causes of secondary osteoporosis. Given that glucocorticoids are considered as a main component of the treatment protocols for a variety of inflammation and immune mediated diseases besides its use as adjuvant to several chemotherapeutic agents, it is crucial to find ways to overcome this critical adverse effect. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), which is a natural compound derived from honeybee propolis displayed promising antiosteoporotic effects against mechanical bone injury in various studies. The current work aimed at investigating the potential protective effect of CAPE against GIO in vivo with emphasis on the modulation of oxidative status and receptor activator of NF kB ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegrin (OPG) signaling. The results showed that CAPE opposed dexamethasone (DEX) mediated alterations in bone histology and tartarate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity. In addition, CAPE restored oxidative balance, Runt related transcription factor 2 (RunX2) expression and reduced caspase 3 activity in femur tissues. Co administration of CAPE with DEX normalized RANKL/OPG ratio and Akt activation indicating a reduction in DEX osteoclastogenesis. In conclusion, concurrent treatment of CAPE with DEX exhibited promising effects in the protection against DEX induced osteoporosis through opposing osteoclastogenesis and protecting osteoblasts. The potent antioxidant activity of CAPE is, at least in part, involved in its anti apoptotic effects and modulation of RunX2 and RANKL/OPG signals. The use of CAPE enriched propolis formulas is strongly recommended for patients on chronic glucocorticoid therapy to help in the attenuation of GIO. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Bisphosphonate (BP) compounds are widely used in the treatment of bone disorders. This group of drugs with a high affinity to Ca+2 ions is rapidly attracted to bone mineral, especially in areas of high resorption. We have engineered unique biodegradable BP nanoparticles (NPs) by dispersion co polymerization of the monomers methacrylate PEG BP) and (3 Aminopropyl)mathacrylamide) with the crosslinker monomer tetra ethylene glycol diacrylate. These NPs possess a dual functionality: (1) covalent attachment of a dye (e.g. near IR dye) or a drug to the nanoparticles through the primary amine groups on the surface of the NPs; (2) chelation to the bone mineral hydroxyapatite through the BP on the surface of the NPs. This study describes the uptake of the unique near IR fluorescent Cy 7 conjugated BP NPs in bone of a young mouse model. Blood half life studies revealed a relatively long half life (approximately 5 h) due to a high concentration of PEG in the BP NPs as well as a relatively long whole body clearance (approximately 2 weeks). Body distribution studies showed a specific uptake of the BP NPs in bone. These unique engineered BP NPs are planned to be utilized in future work for diagnostic and drug delivery systems that are targeted to bone disorders.

AB BackgroundMinimal change disease (MCD) is one of the causes of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in adults. The pathogenesis of proteinuria in MCD has not been fully understood. Recently, it has been reported that the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK)/RANK ligand (RANKL) may contribute to the podocyte biology in kidney diseases. Denosumab is a human anti RANKL monoclonal antibody used to treat osteoporosis. Here we report a case of MCD after denosumab administration.Case presentationA 59 year old male without any episodes of proteinuria was given denosumab to treat osteoporosis. Two weeks after its administration, he noticed a foamy urine and bilateral pretibial edema. Laboratory tests revealed that he had severe proteinuria (15g/g Cr), hypoproteinemia (4.0g/dL), and hypoalbuminemia (1.5g/dL). Based on the results, he was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome. The proteinuria selectivity index was 0.05, indicating selective proteinuria. Renal biopsy showed minor glomerular abnormality with less tubulointerstitial damage, and electron microscopy showed extensive foot process effacement, indicating MCD. With all these results, glucocorticoid therapy of 50mg/day prednisolone was started. After 4weeks of treatment, the urinary protein level remains high (3.1g/g Cr). Prednisolone therapy was continued, and the levels of proteinuria decreased gradually to the range of partial remission (1.2g/g Cr) with another 7weeks of prednisolone treatment, but complete remission was not achieved.ConclusionsThis might be a case wherein RANKL inhibition is associated with the pathogenesis of MCD. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the causal relationship of RANK RANKL signaling to the pathogenesis of MCD.

AB Novel bisphosphonate platinum complexes: [Pt(isopropylamine)(2)(BP)]NO3 (BP = pamidronate and alendronate) have been synthesized and characterized. Their monomeric structure contains a bisphosphonate acting as chelate ligand through its oxygen atom donors, conferring the compounds cationic structure with a good solubility in water. The study of the compounds in solution showed high stability up to 24 h. The cytotoxicity in cancer cell lines has been assessed. We also present preliminary studies on the evaluation of the affinity towards biological targets such as DNA (both calf thymus DNA and supercoiled plasmid DNA) and hydroxyapatite where the complexes showed a low DNA interaction, but a clear affinity for hydroxyapatite comparing to their precursors.

AB Late stage breast cancer commonly metastasises to bone and patient survival averages 2 3 years following diagnosis of bone involvement. One of the most successful treatments for bone metastases is the bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid (ZOL). ZOL has been used in the advanced setting for many years where it has been shown to reduce skeletal complications associated with bone metastasis. More recently, several large adjuvant clinical trials have demonstrated that administration of ZOL can prevent recurrence and improve survival when given in early breast cancer. However, these promising effects were only observed in post menopausal women with confirmed low concentrations of circulating ovarian hormones. In this review we focus on potential interactions between the ovarian hormone, oestrogen, and ZOL to establish credible hypotheses that could explain why antitumour effects are specific to post menopausal women. Specifically, we discuss the molecular and immune cell driven mechanisms by which ZOL and oestrogen affect the tumour microenvironment to inhibit/induce tumour growth and how oestrogen can interact with zoledronic acid to inhibit its anti tumour actions.

AB Objectives With age, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) have reduced ability of differentiating into osteoblasts but have increased ability of differentiating into adipocytes which leads to age related bone loss. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play major roles in regulating BMSC differentiation. This paper explored the role of miRNAs in regulating BMSC differentiation swift fate in age related osteoporosis. Material and methods Mice and human BMSC were isolated from bone marrow, whose miR 130a level was measured. The abilities of BMSC differentiate into osteoblast or fat cell under the transfected with agomiR 130a or antagomiR 130a were analysed by the level of ALP, osteocalcin, Runx2, osterix or peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), Fabp4. Related mechanism was verified via qT PCR, Western blotting (WB) and siRNA transfection. Animal phenotype intravenous injection with agomiR 130a or agomiR NC was explored by Micro CT, immunochemistry and calcein double labelling. Results MiR 130a was dramatically decreased in BMSC of advanced subjects. Overexpression of miR 130a increased osteogenic differentiation of BMSC and attenuated adipogenic differentiation in BMSC, conversely, Inhibition of miR 130a reduced osteogenic differentiation and facilitated lipid droplet formation. Consistently, overexpression of miR 130a in elderly mice dropped off the bone loss. Furthermore, the protein levels of Smad regulatory factors 2 (Smurf2) and PPAR gamma were regulated by miR 130a with an negative effect through directly combining the 3'UTR of Smurf2 and PPAR gamma. Conclusions The results indicated that miR 130a promotes osteoblastic differentiation of BMSC by negatively regulating Smurf2 expression and suppresses adipogenic differentiation of BMSC by targeting the PPAR gamma, and supply a new target for clinical therapy of age related bone loss.

AB Radium 223 dichloride (radium 223) mimics calcium and emits high energy, short range alpha particles resulting in an antitumor effect on bone metastases. This open label, phase IIa nonrandomized study investigated safety and short term efficacy of radium 223 in breast cancer patients with bone dominant disease. Twenty three advanced breast cancer patients with progressive bone dominant disease, and no longer candidates for further endocrine therapy, were to receive radium 223 (50 kBq/kg IV) every 4 weeks for 4 cycles. The coprimary end points were change in urinary N telopeptide of type 1 (uNTX 1) and serum bone alkaline phosphatase (bALP) after 16 weeks of treatment. Exploratory end points included sequential F 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) to assess metabolic changes in osteoblastic bone metastases. Safety data were collected for all patients. Radium 223 significantly reduced uNTX 1 and bALP from baseline to end of treatment. Median uNTX 1 change was  10.1 nmol bone collagen equivalents/mmol creatinine ( 32.8 %; P = 0.0124); median bALP change was  16.7 ng/mL ( 42.0 %; P = 0.0045). Twenty of twenty three patients had FDG PET/CT identifying 155 hypermetabolic osteoblastic bone lesions at baseline: 50 lesions showed metabolic decrease (a parts per thousand yen25 % reduction of maximum standardized uptake value from baseline) after 2 radium 223 injections [32.3 % metabolic response rate (mRR) at week 9], persisting after the treatment period (41.5 % mRR at week 17). Radium 223 was safe and well tolerated. Radium 223 targets areas of increased bone metabolism and shows biological activity in advanced breast cancer patients with bone dominant disease.

AB Zoledronate (Zol) is a third generation bisphosphonate that is widely used as an anti resorptive agent for the treatment of cancer bone metastasis. While there is preclinical data indicating that bisphosphonates such as Zol have direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, such effect has not been firmly established in the clinical setting. This is likely due to the rapid absorption of bisphosphonates by the skeleton after intravenous (i.v.) administration. Herein, we report the reformulation of Zol using nanotechnology and evaluation of this novel nanoscale metal organic frameworks (nMOFs) formulation of Zol as an anticancer agent. The nMOF formulation is comprised of a calcium zoledronate (CaZol) core and a polyethylene glycol (PEG) surface. To preferentially deliver CaZol nMOFs to tumors as well as facilitate cellular uptake of Zol, we incorporated folate (Fop targeted ligands on the nMOFs. The folate receptor (FR) is known to be overexpressed in several tumor types, including head and neck, prostate, and non small cell lung cancers. We demonstrated that these targeted CaZol nMOFs possess excellent chemical and colloidal stability in physiological conditions. The release of encapsulated Zol from the nMOFs occurs in the mid endosomes during nMOF endocytosis. In vitro toxicity studies demonstrated that Fol targeted CaZol nMOFs are more efficient than small molecule Zol in inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in FR overexpressing H460 non small cell lung and PC3 prostate cancer cells. Our findings were further validated in vivo using mouse xenograft models of H460 and PC3. We demonstrated that Fol targeted CaZol nMOFs are effective anticancer agents and increase the direct antitumor activity of Zol by 80 85% in vivo through inhibition of tumor neovasculature, and inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis.

ID ACUPUNCTURE; STIMULATION
AB Carfilzomib (CFZ), a proteasome inhibitor commonly used in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), exhibits limited clinical application due to its cardiotoxicity. In our study, electroacupuncture (EA) at Neiguan acupoint (PC6) effectively reversed CFZ induced reduction in ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS), demonstrating great potential effect for heart protection. Through comparative analysis of the transcriptome profile from heart samples of mice treated with DMSO control, CFZ injection, and EA stimulation, we identified a total of 770 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CFZ (vs. Control) group and 329 DEGs in EA (vs. CFZ) group. Specifically, CFZ (vs. Control) group exhibited 65 up regulated DEGs and 705 down regulated DEGs, while EA (vs. CFZ) group displayed 251 up regulated DEGs and 78 down regulated DEGs. Metascape analysis revealed that among these treatment groups, there were 137 co expressed DEGs remarkably enriched in skeletal system development, cellular response to growth factor stimulus, negative regulation of Wnt signaling pathway, and muscle contraction. The expression patterns of miR 8114, Myl4, Col1a1, Tmem163, Myl7, Sln, and Fxyd3, which belong to the top 30 DEGs, were verified by quantitative real time PCR (RT qPCR). In summary, this study firstly discloses novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying PC6 based EA therapy against CFZ induced cardiotoxicity, potentially serving as a theoretical foundation for further clinical applications.

AB Bisphosphonates, besides being important drugs for the treatment of various bone diseases, could also be used to induce apoptosis in macrophage like and cancer cells. However, their activity in vivo is limited by a short plasma half life and rapid uptake within bone. Therefore, several delivery systems have been proposed to modify their pharmacokinetic profile and biodistribution. Among these, red blood cells (RBCs) represent one of the most promising biological carriers. The aim of this study was to select the best performing compound among Clodronate, Pamidronate, Ibandronate and Zoledronate in killing macrophages and to investigate RBCs as innovative carrier system to selectively target bisphosphonates to macrophages. To this end, the encapsulation of the selected bisphosphonates in autologous RBCs as well as the effect on macrophages, both in vitro and in vivo were studied. This work shows that, among the tested bisphosphonates, Zoledronate has proven to be the most active molecule. Human and murine RBCs have been successfully loaded with Zoledronate by a procedure of hypotonic dialysis and isotonic resealing, obtaining a dose dependent drug entrapment with a maximal loading of 7.96 +/  2.03, 6.95 +/  3.9 and 7.0 +/  1.89 mu moles of Zoledronate/ml of packed RBCs for human, Swiss and Balb/C murine RBCs, respectively. Engineered RBCs were able to detach human and murine macrophages in vitro, leading to a detachment of 66 +/  8%, 67 +/  8% and 60.5 +/  3.5% for human, Swiss and Balb/C RBCs, respectively. The in vivo efficacy of loaded RBCs was tested in Balb/C mice administering 59 mu g/mouse of RBC encapsulated Zoledronate. By a single administration, depletion of 29.0 +/  16.38% hepatic macrophages and of 67.84 +/  5.48% spleen macrophages was obtained, confirming the ability of encapsulated Zoledronate to deplete macrophages in vivo. In conclusion, RBCs loaded with Zoledronate should be considered a suitable system for targeted delivery to macrophages, both in vitro and in vivo.

AB Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase 5 (ACP5), which is essential for bone resorption and osteoclast differentiation, promotes cell motility through the modulation of focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation. However, whether ACP5 contributes to the metastasis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. In this paper, a complementary DNA microarray, serial deletion, site directed mutagenesis and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that ACP5 is a direct transcriptional target of Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1). ACP5 expression was markedly higher in HCC tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues. ACP5 overexpression was correlated with microvascular invasion, poor differentiation and higher tumor node metastasis stage. HCC patients with positive ACP5 expression had poorer prognoses than those with negative ACP5 expression. A multivariate analysis revealed that ACP5 expression was an independent and significant risk factor for disease recurrence and reduced patient survival following curative resection. Transwell assays and an orthotopic metastatic model showed that the upregulation of ACP5 promoted HCC invasion and lung metastasis, whereas ACP5 knockdown inhibited these processes. The knockdown of ACP5 significantly attenuated FoxM1 enhanced invasion and lung metastasis. Immunohistochemistry revealed that ACP5 expression was positively correlated with FoxM1 expression in human HCC tissues, and their coexpression was associated with poor prognoses. In summary, ACP5 is a direct transcriptional and functional target of FoxM1. This novel FoxM1/ACP5 signaling pathway promotes HCC metastasis and may be a candidate biomarker for prognosis and a target for new therapies.

AB The p28 subunit of the composite cytokine IL 27 comprises a polyglutamic acid domain, which is unique among type I cytokines. This domain is very similar to the acidic domain known to confer hydroxyapatite (HA) binding properties and bone tropism to bone sialoprotein. We observed IL 27 binding to HA, in accordance with previous studies reporting successful p28 HA chromatography. The IL 27 polyglutamic acid domain is located in a flexible inter a helix loop, and HA bound IL 27 retained biological activity. Using IL 27 alanine mutants, we observed that the p28 polyglutamic acid domain confers HA and bone binding properties to IL27 in vitro and bone tropism in vivo. Because IL 27 is a potent regulator of cells residing in endosteal bone marrow niches such as osteoclasts, T regulatory, memory T, plasma, and stem cells, this specific property could be beneficial for therapeutic applications. IL 27 has potent antitumoral and antiosteoclastogenic activities. It could therefore also be useful for therapies targeting hematologic cancer or solid tumors metastasis with bone tropism. Furthermore, these observations suggest that polyglutamic motifs could be grafted onto other type I cytokine inter a helix loops to modify their pharmacological properties.

AB Combined parathyroid hormone (PTH) and bisphosphonate (alendronate ALN) therapy has recently been shown to increase bone volume fraction and plate like trabecular structure beyond either monotherapy. To identify the mechanism through which plate like structure was enhanced, we used in vivo microcomputed tomography (mu CT) of the proximal tibia metaphysis and individual trabecular dynamics (ITD) analysis to quantify connectivity repair (incidences of rod connection and plate perforation filling) and deterioration (incidences of rod disconnection and plate perforation). Three month old female, intact rats were scanned before and after a 12 day treatment period of vehicle (Veh, n = 5), ALN (n = 6), PTH (n = 6), and combined (PTH+ALN, n = 6) therapy. Additionally, we used computational simulation and finite element (FE) analysis to delineate the contributions of connectivity repair or trabecular thickening to trabecular bone stiffness. Our results showed that the combined therapy group had greater connectivity repair (5.8 +/  0.5% connected rods and 2.0 +/  0.3% filled plates) beyond that of the Veh group, resulting in the greatest net gain in connectivity. For all treatment groups, increases in bone volume due to thickening (5 31%) were far greater than those due to connectivity repair (2 3%). Newly formed bone contributing only to trabecular thickening caused a 10%, 41%, and 69% increase in stiffness in the ALN, PTH, and PTH+ALN groups, respectively. Moreover, newly formed bone that led to connectivity repair resulted in an additional improvement in stiffness, with the highest in PTH+ALN (by an additional 12%), which was significantly greater than either PTH (5.6%) or ALN (4.5%). An efficiency ratio was calculated as the mean percent increase in stiffness divided by mean percent increase in BV for either thickening or connectivity repair in each treatment. For all treatments, the efficiency ratio of connectivity repair (ALN: 2.9; PTH: 3.4; PTH+ALN: 4.4) was higher than that due to thickening (ALN: 2.0; PTH: 1.7; PTH+ALN: 2.2), suggesting connectivity repair required less new bone formation to induce larger gains in stiffness. We conclude that through rod connection and plate perforation filling PTH+ALN combination therapy improved bone stiffness in a more efficient and effective manner than either monotherapy.

AB LIM mineralization protein 1 (LMP 1) is it novel intracellular osteogenic factor associated with bone development that has been implicated in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway. This preliminary study evaluated the possibility of LMP 1 based retroviral gene therapy to stimulate osteoblast differentiation in vitro and fracture repair in vivo. A moloney leukemia virus (MLV) based retroviral vector to express LMP 1 with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag was developed, and its effects were evaluated on MC3T3 E1 cell differentiation and in the rat femur fracture model. MC3T3 E1 osteoblasts transduced with the MLV HA LMP 1 vector demonstrated significantly increased osteoblast marker gene expression (P<0.05) and mineral deposition compared to control transduced cells. Femoral midshaft fractures were produced in Fischer 344 rats by the three point bending technique. The MLV HA LMP 1 or control vector was applied at the fracture site through percutaneous injections 1 day postfracture. Analysis of fracture healing of 10 MLV HA LMP 1 treated and 10 control MLV beta galactosidase (beta gal) treated animals was completed at 3 weeks by X ray, peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and histology. MLV HA_LMP_1 treated animals had 63% more bone mineral content at the fracture site (P < 0.01), and 45% less 34% greater total hard callus area (P < 0.05) compared to MLV beta gal treated animals. There was no effect of LMP 1 treatment on the density of the hard callus. Immunohisto chemistry revealed expression of the LMP 1 transgene in the fracture callus at 21 days postfracture. Immunohistochemistry also revealed that LMP 1 transgene expression did not result in an increase in BMP 4 expression in the fracture callus. Compared to MLV BMP 4 gene therapy studies, MLV HA LMP 1 gene therapy improved bony union of the fracture gap to a greater extent and did not cause heterotopic bone formation. This suggests that LMP 1 may be a better potential candidate for gene therapy for fracture repair than BMP 4. These exciting, albeit preliminary, findings indicate that LMP 1 based gene therapy may potentially be a simple and effective means to enhance fracture repair that warrants further investigation.

TI TNF α induced Inhibition of Protein Myristoylation Via Binding
   Between NMT1 and Sorbs2 in Osteoblasts
SO IN VIVO
LA English
DT Article
DE Myristoylation; NMT1; Sorbs2; osteoblast; TNF alpha
ID N MYRISTOYLTRANSFERASE
AB Background/aim: Bone resolution due to tumor invasion often occurs on the surface of the jaw and is important for clinical prognosis. Although cytokines, such as TNF alpha are known to impair osteoblasts, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Protein myristoylation, a post translational modification, plays an important role in the development of immune responses and cancerization of cells. A clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying this involvement will provide insights into molecular targeted therapies. N myristoyltransferase1 (NMT1), a specific enzyme involved in myristoylation, is expressed in cancer cells and in other normal cells, suggesting that changes in myristoylation may result from the regulation of NMT1 in cancer cells. Materials and methods: Using newly emerging state of the art techniques such as the Click it assay, RNA interference, mass spectrometry, immunoprecipitation, immunocytochemistry, and western blotting, the expression of myristoylated proteins and the role of TNF alpha stimulation on NMT1 and Sorbs2 binding were evaluated in a murine osteoblastic cell line (MC3T3 E1). Results: The expression of myristoylated proteins was detected; however, TNF alpha stimulation resulted in their inhibition in MC3T3 E1 cells. The expression of NMT1 also increased. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry identified Sorbs2 as a novel binding protein of NMT1, which upon TNF alpha stimulation, inhibited myristoylation. Conclusion: The binding between NMT1 and Sorbs2 can regulate myristoylation, and NMT1 can be considered as a potential target molecule for tumor invasion.

AB To explore the skeletal effects and the potential underlying mechanisms of treatment with two thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) or metformin in insulin resistant mice, 24 female, 12 week old C57BL6J ob/ob mice were evaluated according to the following treatment groups for 6 weeks: placebo group, pioglitazone group (Pio), rosiglitazone group (Rosi), and metformin group (Met). Bone mineral density (BMD), bone microarchitecture, bone histomorphometry, and expression of three phenotype specific gene markers, including bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2), runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and fatty acid binding protein 4 (Fabp4), were compared across the four groups. At the femur, the Met group had the highest BMD (0.084 +/  A 0.001 g/cm(2)) and trabecular bone volume/total volume (0.644 +/  A 0.018 %) and the lowest trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp.) (0.143 +/  A 0.008 mu m), whereas the Rosi group had lower BMD (0.076 +/  A 0.003 g/cm(2)) and a relatively higher degree of Tb.Sp. (0.173 +/  A 0.024 mu m). A histomorphometric analysis revealed that in the Rosi group the number of adipocytes was fourfold higher than in the placebo group and fivefold higher than in the Met group, whereas the highest osteoid width and mineral apposition rate were found in the Met group (49.88 +/  A 48.53 mu m and 4.46 +/  A 1.72 mu m/day). Furthermore, the Rosi group displayed the highest level of Fabp4 gene expression, which was accompanied by normal expression levels of Bmp2 and Runx2. Seemingly, metformin is a bone friendly antidiabetic drug. Rosiglitazone had adverse effects on the skeleton at the trabecular bone even in insulin resistant mice, whereas no evidence of adverse effects was found for pioglitazone.

TI IGF 1 reverses the osteogenic inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on

AB Glucocorticoid Induced Osteoporosis (GIOP) is a prevalent clinical complication caused by large dose administration of glucocorticoids, such as Dexamethasone (Dex) and Prednisone. GIOP may lead to fractures and even Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head (ONFH). It has been reported that glucocorticoids inhibit osteogenesis via the suppression of osteogenic differentiation in Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs), but the precise mechanism underlying this suppression awaits further investigation. Meanwhile, novel and efficacious therapies are recommended to cope with GIOP. In this study, we demonstrated that Dex had the inhibitory effect on Bone Morphogenetic Protein 9 (BMP9) induced ALP activities and matrix mineralization in Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs). In addition, the study confirmed that Dex decreased the expression of osteogenic markers such as Runx2 and OPN. However, the inhibitory effect of Dex on these osteogenic markers can be reversed when combined with insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF 1). Regarding the inhibitory mechanism, we found that the level of AKT and p AKT can be decreased by Dex and that Ly294002, the PI3K inhibitor, can block the reversal effect of IGF 1. Moreover, the knockdown or inhibition of COX 2 produced similar results to those of Ly294002. Our findings indicated that IGF 1 may reverse the osteogenic inhibitory effect of Dex via PI3K/AKT pathway, which may be associated with the up regulation of COX 2. This study may provide new clinical management strategy for GIOP cases.

AB Objective: FGFR3 chondrodysplasia is caused by a gain of function mutation of the FGFR3 gene. The disease causes abnormal growth plate cartilage and lacks effective drug treatment. We sought to establish an in vivo model for the study of FGFR3 chondrodysplasia pathology and drug testing.
   Design: We created cartilage from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and transplanted the cartilage into the subcutaneous spaces of immunodeficient mice. We then created cartilage from the hiPSCs of patients with FGFR3 chondrodysplasia and transplanted them into immunodeficient mice. We treated some mice with a FGFR inhibitor after the transplantation.
   Results: Xenografting the hiPSC derived cartilage reproduced human growth plate cartilage consisting of zones of resting, proliferating, prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes and bone in immunodeficient mice. Immunohistochemistry of xenografts using anti human nuclear antigen antibody indicated that all chondrocytes in growth plate cartilage were human, whereas bone was composed of human and mouse cells. The pathology of small hypertrophic chondrocytes due to up regulated FGFR3 signaling in FGFR3 skeletal dysplasia was recapitulated in growth plate cartilage formed in the xenografts of patient specific hiPSC derived cartilage. The mean diameters of hypertrophic chondrocytes between wild type and thanatophoric dysplasia were significantly different (95% CI: 13.2 26.9; n = 4 mice, one way analysis of variance (ANOVA)). The pathology was corrected by systemic administration of a FGFR inhibitor to the mice.
   Conclusion: The patient specific growth plate cartilage xenograft model for FGFR3 skeletal dysplasia indicated recapitulation of pathology and effectiveness of a FGFR inhibitor for treatment and warrants more study for its usefulness to study disease pathology and drug testing.

TI Inhibitory effect of YQHYRJ recipe on osteoblast

AB Ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a common disease in Asian countries. Osteoblast differentiation in posterior longitudinal ligamentous fibroblast is a pathologic basis of OPLL. Nowadays, an effective pharmacotherapy for OPLL is still hunted for. YQHYRJ Recipe (YQHYRJ) is designed based on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theories, and previous clinic trials reported its effect on relieving syndromes of cervical spondylopathy. To clarify the YQHYRJ effect of OPLL on a cellular level, we induced mice fibroblasts from posterior longitudinal ligaments to differentiate into osteoblasts by human recombinant BMP 2, and treated them with YQHYRJ and its three sub compounds: YQ, HY and RJ. YQHYRJ and the sub compounds reduced the increase of fibroblast proliferation, mineralization, type I collagen secretion induced by BMP 2 via MTT, alizarin red staining and immunochemical examination. Moreover, these agents inhibited BMP 2 induced upregulation of ossification related genes ALP, Colt and OC as well as BMP signal molecules Smad1, Smad 5 and Runx2 mRNA expression. These results suggested YQHYRJ to be effective in inhibiting osteoblast differentiation induced by BMP 2 in fibroblasts from posterior longitudinal ligament. YQHYRJ might be a promising medicine for preventing OPLL disease.

AB Background: Zoledronate suppresses human sarcomas by blocking the formation of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) via inhibiting GGPP synthase. Objectives: Designing of new derivative of dronic acid (1 hydroxy 2 (4 nitro 1H imidazol 1 yl)ethan 1,1 diyl)bis phosphonic acid), structurally related to zoledronate to be used for osteosarcoma therapy. Methods: 1 hydroxy 2 (4 nitro 1H imidazol 1 yl)ethan 1,1 diyl)bis(phosphonic acid) was synthesized in one pot reaction with a yield of 65 +/  4%. The synthesized nitro zoledronate compound was successfully radiolabeled with Tc 99m with a radiochemical purity of 92.05%. Docking accuracy and scoring reliability for the new nitro zoledronate with human GGPPS using MOE software has been presented. Results and Conclusion: The nitro zoledronate successfully coupled with technetium 99m at high yield to investigate its in vivo biodistribution which indicated highly selective uptake in the skeletal system and rapid clearance from soft tissues. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the nitro zoledronate was evaluated and potently inhibited the osteosarcoma cell line (MG 63) after 72 hours with an IC50 value of 10 mu M. To summarize, our data point to a promising candidate to improve osteosarcoma therapy.

AB A biomimetic Zein polydopamine based nanofiber scaffold was fabricated to deliver bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP 2) peptide conjugated titanium dioxide nanoparticles in a sustained manner for investigating its osteogenic differentiation potential. To prolong its retention time at the target site, BMP 2 peptide has been conjugated to titanium dioxide nanoparticles owing to its high surface to volume ratio. The effect of biochemical cues from BMP 2 peptide and nanotopographical stimulation of electrospun Zein polydopamine nanofiber were examined for its enhanced osteogenic expression of human fetal osteoblast cells. The sustained delivery of bioactive signals, improved cell adhesion, mineralization, and differentiation could be attributed to its highly interconnected nanofibrous matrix with unique material composition. Further, the expression of osteogenic markers revealed that the fabricated nanofibrous scaffold possess better cell biomaterial interactions. These promising results demonstrate the potential of the composite nanofibrous scaffold as an effective biomaterial substrate for bone regeneration.

TI The Effect of Antiosteoporosis Therapy With Risedronate on Rotator Cuff

AB Background: Osteoporosis increases the revision rate of rotator cuff repair (RCR). Weak fixation might not be the only cause of high RCR failure rates. The biological mechanism associated with tendon to bone healing after RCR in osteoporosis should be investigated. Hypothesis: (1) Osteoporosis would impair rotator cuff healing through the high osteoclastic activity at the repaired interface. (2) Risedronate would promote rotator cuff healing by reducing osteoclastic activity at the repaired interface. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 84 female Sprague Dawley rats were randomly treated using ovariectomy or sham surgeries to establish osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic rat models. After confirming osteoporosis, a chronic rotator cuff tear model was created and RCR was performed. Postoperatively, osteoporotic rats were randomly divided into osteoporosis (OP) and osteoporosis with risedronate administration (OP+RIS) groups. Nonosteoporotic rats were used as the control (CON) group. Osteoclastic activity was measured at 1 and 3 weeks after RCR, and histologic analysis of the tendon to bone interface, bone morphometric evaluation, and biomechanical tests were performed at 4 and 8 weeks. Results: At the early healing stages of 1 and 3 weeks after RCR, the OP group showed the highest osteoclast density at the repaired interface. Compared with the OP group, risedronate administration significantly decreased osteoclast density in the OP+RIS group. At 8 weeks, histologic scores were greater in the OP+RIS group than in the OP group but still lower than in the CON group. Histologic scores at 8 weeks were negatively correlated with osteoclast density at the early healing stage. Additionally, the OP+RIS group showed better bone morphometric parameters and biomechanical properties than did the OP group. Conclusion: Osteoporosis impaired rotator cuff healing, which might be related to the high osteoclast density at the repaired interface at the early healing stage. Postoperative risedronate administration decreased osteoclast density and enhanced rotator cuff healing in osteoporotic rats, although the effect was inferior to that in nonosteoporotic rats.

AB Adipose tissues provide circulating nutrients and hormones. We present in vivo mouse studies highlighting roles for Wnt signals in both aspects of metabolism. beta catenin activation in PPAR gamma expressing fat progenitors (PBCA) decreased fat mass and induced fibrotic replacement of subcutaneous fat specifically. In spite of lipodystrophy, PBCA mice did not develop the expected diabetes and hepatosteatosis, but rather exhibited improved glucose metabolism and normal insulin sensitivity. Glucose uptake was increased in muscle independently of insulin, associated with cell surface translocation of glucose transporters and AMPK activation. Ex vivo assays showed these effects were likely secondary to blood borne signals since PBCA sera or conditioned media from PBCA fat progenitors enhanced glucose uptake and activated AMPK in muscle cultures. Thus, adipose progenitor Wnt activation dissociates lipodystrophy from dysfunctional metabolism and highlights a fat muscle endocrine axis, which may represent a potential therapy to lower blood glucose and improve metabolism.

AB Cancer treatment related bone loss has become growing problematic, especially in breast and prostate cancer treated with hormone/endocrine therapy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, bone loss caused by targeted therapy in cancer patients is largely unknown yet. In present study, a kinase inhibitors screen was applied for MC3T3 E1, a murine osteoprogenitor cell line, and seven kinase inhibitors (GSK1838705A, PF 04691502, Dasatinib, Masitinib, GDC 0941, XL880 and Everolimus) were found to suppress the cell viability with dose and time dependent manner. The most interesting is that many kinase inhibitors (such as lapatinib, erlotinib and sunitinib) can promote MC3T3 E1 cell proliferation at 0.01 mu M. 4 out of 7 inhibitors were selected to perform the functional study and found that they lead to cell cycle dysregulation, treatments of PF 04691502 (AKT inhibitor), Dasatinib (Src inhibitor) and Everolimus (mTOR inhibitor) lead to G1 arrest of MC3T3 E1 cells via downregulation of cyclin D1 and p AKT, whereas XL880 (MET and VEGFR inhibitor) treatment results in increase of sub G1 and G2/M phase by upregulation of p53 protein. Our work provides important indications for the comprehensive care of cancer patients treated with some targeted drugs.

AB The apolipoprotein E knockout (Apo E / ) mouse is a well known model of atherosclerosis. Bisphosphonates, through their affinity to hydroxyapatite, are known to reduce arterial calcification in several animal models. Thus, we examined the effect of two therapeutically used oral bisphosphonates, alendronate and risedronate, on plaque formation in the Apo E /  mouse. The drugs were administered by gavage to 16 week old Apo E /  mice for 8 weeks. At 8 weeks, there was no difference in bone mineral density (BMD) of the alendronate  and risedronate treated mice at any site. A time dependent increase in BMD was demonstrated in Apo E /  mice with risedronate (p < 0.01). Histological evaluation revealed that both bisphosphonates caused atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Five of 17 mice had severe inflammation with or without plaque rupture, while seven mice showed inflammation, but without plaque rupture. Neither caspase 3 nor metalloproteinases 2 and 9 were increased in ruptured plaques on immunocytochemistry. Quantitative measurements of arterial caliber remained unaffected. Our finding of plaque inflammation and rupture in bisphosphonate treated Apo E /  mice may provide the first animal model for studies aimed at characterizing mechanisms of plaque rupture in animal models.

TI High dose glucocorticoids increase serum levels of soluble IL 6 receptor
   α and its ratio to soluble gp130:: an additional mechanism for early
   increased bone resorption

AB Objective: Glucocorticoids (GCs) at pharmacological doses stimulate bone resorption. Mechanisms of this action are unclear. The osteoclastogenic cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 acts through an oligomeric receptor consisting of two subunits, gp80 (or IL 6 receptor alpha, IL 6R alpha) and gp130; both exist in membrane and soluble forms. Soluble IL 6R alpha (sII 6Ra) enhances, while sgp130 inhibits IL 6 signalling. In vitro, GCs enhance many effects of IL 6 by up regulation of IL 6R alpha. The aim of the present study was to assess acute changes of IL 6 system in the peripheral blood of patients given high dose GCs.
   Subjects and methods: Serum levels of IL 6, sIL 6R alpha, sgp130 and bone turnover markers were assessed before and each day during treatment in 24 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients undergoing high dose (prednisolone, 15 mg/kg per day), short term (3 to 5 days) intravenous GC therapy for relapse at the Regional Multiple Sclerosis Centre.
   Results: An immediate and marked fall of osteocalcin and an early increase of C terminal telopeptide of type I collagen were already noticed at day 2 (P < 0.001 and P < 0.02, respectively); both became more apparent in the subsequent days. IL 6 was always below or near the detection limit of our ELISA. sgp130 showed a slight increase. sIL 6R alpha significantly increased, peaking at day 4 (P < 0.01). However, inter individual variability of response was noticed. Four patients showed a slight decrease, while no change was observed in one patient and an increase was noticed in the remaining nineteen (maximum change ranging from + 10% to + 67% with respect to baseline). In these patients, a significant increase of sIL 6R alpha/sgp130 ratio was apparent. No correlation was found between bone turnover markers and any measured component of the IL 6 system.
   Conclusions: sIL 6R alpha and sIL 6R alpha/sgp130 ratio are precociously increased in the peripheral blood of the vast majority of patients given high dose, intravenous GCs. The increase of systemically available sIL 6R alpha conceivably results in the enhancement of IL 6 dependent osteoclastogenesis. The role of such a mechanism in the bone loss observed in inflammatory and immune mediated diseases (where abundancy of IL 6 in the bone microenvironment is expected) requires further investigation.

ID OSTEOPOROSIS; MECHANISMS
AB Bisphosphonate related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) is an adverse drug reaction described as the progressive destruction and death of bone tissue of the mandible or maxilla, in the course of bisphosphonate therapy. Orally administered bisphosphonates, widely used for the treatment of osteoporosis, are rarely associated with BRONJ. Instead, the risk greatly increases whether the patient is concomitantly taking steroid and/or immunosuppressant agents. The aims of this paper are to briefly discuss the evidence of the associations between bisphosphonate therapy and BRONJ, and the effects of co occurring factors such as the presence of rheumatoid arthritis, dental surgery, and concomitant corticosteroid therapy. In particular, we present the case of an elderly woman with BRONJ suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, with a recent dental extraction and with a very unusual complication: a temporal abscess, who was successfully treated.

AB ObjectivesTumour hypoxia is a major obstacle in cancer therapy that leads to poor prognosis. Therefore, the development of cancer treatments that are effective in hypoxia is necessary. Nitrogen containing bisphosphonates (N BPs), which are used to treat bone disease, are cytotoxic to several cancer cells in normoxia. Therefore, we investigated the cytotoxicity of N BPs in cancer cells in hypoxia.
   MethodsWe studied the cytotoxicities of N BPs, statins and anticancer drugs in human cancer cells under hypoxic conditions (1% O 2). The expression levels of enzymes in the mevalonate pathway in hypoxia were measured by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting.
   Key findingsIn hypoxia, cell growth inhibition by 5 fluorouracil and cisplatin was not changed as compared to that in normoxia; however, cell growth inhibition by N BPs and via zoledronate induced apoptosis was higher in hypoxia than that in normoxia. Furthermore, geranylgeraniol completely inhibited the growth inhibitory effects of zoledronate. Additionally, the mRNA and protein levels of 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase significantly decreased in hypoxia. Moreover, simvastatin potentiated the growth inhibitory effect of zoledronate.
   ConclusionsThe cytotoxicity of N BPs, but not 5 fluorouracil and cisplatin, is potentiated in hypoxia, through the loss of HMG CoA reductase function. N BPs may be effective against cancer in normoxia and hypoxia.

AB Osteogenesis imperfecta (01) is a collagen related disorder associated to dominant, recessive or X linked transmission, mainly caused by mutations in type I collagen genes or in genes involved in type I collagen metabolism. Among the recessive forms, 01 types VII, VIII, and IX are due to mutations in CRTAP, P3H1, and PPIB genes, respectively. They code for the three components of the endoplasmic reticulum complex that catalyzes 3 hydroxylation of type I collagen alpha 1Pro986. Under hydroxylation of this residue leads to collagen structural abnormalities and results in moderate to lethal 01 phenotype, despite the exact molecular mechanisms are still not completely clear. To shed light on these recessive forms, primary fibroblasts from OI patients with mutations in CRTAP (n = 3), P3H1 (n = 3), PPIB (n = 1) genes and from controls (n = 4) were investigated by a functional proteomic approach. Cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton asset, protein fate, and metabolism were delineated as mainly affected. While western blot experiments confirmed altered expression of lamin A/C and cofilin 1, immunofluorescence analysis using antibody against lamin A/C and phalloidin showed an aberrant organization of nucleus and cytoskeleton. This is the first report describing an altered organization of intracellular structural proteins in recessive OI and pointing them as possible novel target for 01 treatment.
   Significance: OI is a prototype for skeletal dysplasias. It is a highly heterogeneous collagen related disorder with dominant, recessive and X linked transmission. There is no definitive cure for this disease, thus a better understanding of the molecular basis of its pathophysiology is expected to contribute in identifying potential targets to develop new treatments.
   Based on this concept, we performed a functional proteomic study to delineate affected molecular pathways in primary fibroblasts from recessive OI patients, carrying mutations in CRTAP (01 type VII), P3HI (01 type VIII), and PPIB (01 type IX) genes. Our analyses demonstrated the occurrence of an altered cytoskeleton and, for the first time in 01, of nuclear lamina organization. Hence, cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton components may be considered as novel drug targets for clinical management of the disease. Finally, according to our analyses, 01 emerged to share similar deregulated pathways and molecular aberrances, as previously described, with other rare disorders caused by different genetic defects. Those aberrances may provide common pharmacological targets to support classical clinical approach in treating different diseases. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Legg Calve Perthes disease (LCPD) is a juvenile form of osteonecrosis of the femoral head that presents in children aged 2 14 years. To date, there is no effective medical therapy for treating LCPD largely due to an inability to modulate the repair process, including the predominance of bone resorption. This investigation aims to evaluate the feasibility of using gold nanoparticles (GNPs) that are surface modified with a bisphosphonate compound for the treatment of osteonecrosis at the cellular level. Studies have found osteoclast mediated resorption to be a process that contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of femoral head deformities arising from Perthes disease. Our in vitro model was designed to elucidate the effect of alendronate (a bisphosphonate) modified GNPs, on osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast function. RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were cultured with recombinant mouse receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand (RANKL), which stimulates osteoclastogenesis, and were then treated with alendronate modified GNPs for 24, 48, and 72 h. Cell proliferation, osteoclast function, and osteoclast morphology were evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion assay, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging. Comparative studies were performed with GNPs that were only stabilized with citrate ions and with alendronate alone. Neither osteoclastogenesis nor osteoclast function were adversely affected by the presence of the citrate GNP. Alendronate modified GNPs had an enhanced effect on inducing osteoclast apoptosis and impairing osteoclast function when compared to unbound alendronate populations.

TI Effect of Bone Mineral Guideline Target Achievement on Mortality in

AB Background: Abnormalities in bone mineral metabolism parameters are common in patients with end stage kidney disease on dialysis therapy. The National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines propose targets for calcium, phosphate, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels in patients undergoing dialysis. However, whether achievement of these targets improves survival is unknown.
   Study Design: Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting & Participants: Incident patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis therapy in the United Kingdom from 2000 2004 who survived at least 12 months.
   Predictor: Achievement of KDOQI calcium, phosphate, and iPTH guideline targets during the first year of dialysis therapy.
   Outcomes: All cause mortality in the subsequent 2 years.
   Measurements: Calcium, phosphate, and iPTH at quarterly intervals, demographic and comorbid condition data at baseline.
   Results: We included 7,076 incident patients (4,947 hemodialysis, 2,129 peritoneal dialysis) in our analysis. Approximately two thirds of patients were men and 21% had diabetes as the cause of kidney failure. Guideline target achievement for each quarter varied from 23% 26% for iPTH level, 43% 47% for calcium level, and 54% 62% for phosphate level targets. In adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, patients who achieved guideline targets in all 4 quarters did not have a survival advantage over patients who never achieved target (P > 0.1 for calcium, phosphate, and iPTH).
   Limitations: Missing information about medication use, vitamin D and alkaline phosphatase levels, and dialysate calcium content.
   Conclusions: Our findings do not support the use of KDOQI bone mineral guideline achievement as a quality measure for dialysis care. Prospective studies with longer term follow up are needed to define the optimal cutoff values for calcium, phosphate, and iPTH and assess the effect of guideline implementation on patient survival.

AB Periostitis, which is characterized by bony pain and diffuse periosteal ossification, has been increasingly reported with prolonged clinical use of voriconazole. While resolution of clinical symptoms following discontinuation of therapy suggests a causative role for voriconazole, the biological mechanisms contributing to voriconazole induced periostitis are unknown. To elucidate potential mechanisms, we exposed human osteoblasts in vitro to voriconazole or fluconazole at 15 or 200 mu g/ml (reflecting systemic or local administration, respectively), under nonosteogenic or osteogenic conditions, for 1, 3, or 7 days and evaluated the effects on cell proliferation (reflected by total cellular DNA) and osteogenic differentiation (reflected by alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium accumulation, and expression of genes involved in osteogenic differentiation). Release of free fluoride, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) was also measured in cell supernatants of osteoblasts exposed to triazoles, with an ion selective electrode (for free fluoride) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (for VEGF and PDGF). Voriconazole but not fluconazole significantly enhanced the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts. In contrast to clinical observations, no increases in free fluoride levels were detected following exposure to either voriconazole or fluconazole; however, significant increases in the expression of VEGF and PDGF by osteoblasts were observed following exposure to voriconazole. Our results demonstrate that voriconazole can induce osteoblast proliferation and enhance osteogenic activity in vitro. Importantly, and in contrast to the previously proposed mechanism of fluoride stimulated osteogenesis, our findings suggest that voriconazole induced periostitis may also occur through fluoride independent mechanisms that enhance the expression of cytokines that can augment osteoblastic activity.

AB Recently increasing emphasis is placed on preventive health and management of chronic comorbidities avoiding long term toxicities of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Drawing from this background we decided to use the Saos 2, osteosarcoma cell line, as a cellular model, to evaluate the effects of some antiretroviral drugs such as abacavir (ABC), tenofovir (TDF), efavirenz (EFV), etravirine (ETR), and darunavir (DRV), on bone differentiation related pathways. According to our observation, treatment with TDF and ABC affects the ability of the cells to produce calcium deposits with a reduced expression of type I collagen gene and p21 mRNA, also increasing the activity of Wnt3a related pathway. On the other hand treatment with EFV and DRV was not related to any significant reduction of calcium deposits but displayed a decrease in the expression of Wnt3a at day 14 and Type I Collagen at day 7 compared with untreated cells, even if this last down regulation was not confirmed at day 14. Instead ETR administration to Saos 2 cells increases the calcium deposits collagen type I production, as a result of Wnt3a mRNA overexpression, and of an upregulation of collagen type I expression, being also the only drug able to increase the expression of p21 cdk inhibitor as further marker of terminal differentiation. In summary these data suggest the potential negative interference of TDF and ABC on bone differentiation. DRV and EFV partially affect collagen type I production, instead ETR facilitates a positive bone balance as a result of an increased osteoblasts terminal differentiation. J. Cell.

AB The crosstalk between tumor cells and bone cells in the bone microenvironment is crucial to understanding the mechanism of bone metastasis formation. We developed an in vitro fully human preclinical model of a co culture of breast cancer cells and monocytes undergoing differentiation towards osteoclasts. We optimized a model of osteoclastogenesis starting from a sample of peripheral blood collected from healthy donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were first separated by density gradient centrifugation, seeded at a high density and induced to differentiate by adding two growth factors (GFs): receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF). The cells were left in culture for 14 days and then fixed and analyzed by downstream analysis. In osteolytic bone metastases, one of the effects of cancer cell arrival in bone is the induction of osteoclastogenesis. We thus challenged our model with co cultures of breast cancer cells to study the differentiation power of cancer cells with respect to GFs. A straightforward way of studying cancer cell osteoclast interaction is to perform indirect co cultures based on the use of conditioned medium collected from breast cancer cell cultures and mixed with fresh medium. This mixture is then used to induce osteoclast differentiation. We also optimized a method of direct co culture in which cancer cells and monocytes undergoing differentiation share the medium and exchange secreted factors. This is a significant improvement over the original indirect co culture method as researchers can observe the reciprocal interactions of the two cell types and perform downstream analyses for both cancer cells and osteoclasts. This method enables us to study the effect of drugs on the metastatic bone microenvironment and to seed cell lines other than those derived from breast cancer. The model can also be used to study other diseases such as osteoporosis or other bone conditions.

AB It is known that osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be promoted by suppression of adipogenesis of MSCs. We have recently found that the chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) significantly reduces adipogenesis of MSCs. In the present study, we examined whether TUDCA can promote osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) by regulating Integrin 5 (ITGA5) associated with activation of ERK1/2 signal pathway and thereby enhance bone tissue regeneration by reducing apoptosis and the inflammatory response. TUDCA treatment promoted in vitro osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs and in vivo bone tissue regeneration in a calvarial defect model, as confirmed by micro computed tomography, histological staining, and immunohistochemistry for osteocalcin. In addition, TUDCA treatment significantly decreased apoptosis and the inflammatory response in vivo and in vitro, which is important to enhance bone tissue regeneration. These results indicate that TUDCA plays a critical role in enhancing osteogenesis of BMMSCs, and is therefore a potential alternative drug for bone tissue regeneration. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB The functions of Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs) during osteoclastic differentiation were investigated using the NHE inhibitor amiloride and a monoclonal antibody (MAb). Compared with sRANKL stimulated control cells, amiloride decreased the number of large TRAP positive osteoclast cells (OCs) with 10 nuclei and increased the number of small TRAP positive OCs with 10 nuclei during sRANKL dependent osteoclastic differentiation of RAW264.7 cells. NHE10 mRNA expression and OC differentiation markers were increased by sRANKL stimulation in dose  and time dependent manners. NHEs 1 9 mRNA expression was not increased by sRANKL stimulation. Similar to amiloride, a rat anti mouse NHE10 MAb (clone 6B11) decreased the number of large TRAP positive OCs, but increased the number of small TRAP positive OCs. These findings suggested that inhibition of NHEs by amiloride or an anti NHE10 MAb prevented sRANKL promoted cellular fusion. The anti NHE10 MAb has the potential for use as an effective inhibitor of bone resorption for targeted bone disease therapy.

AB Although once yearly intravenous administration of zoledronic acid has been reported to inhibit bone resorption and increase bone mineral density, no studies have evaluated its effectiveness in treating osteoporosis in Japanese patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics and assess the safety of and changes in bone metabolism associated with zoledronic acid treatment in Japanese patients with primary osteoporosis. This was a single administration study with a single blind parallel group design. The study participants were 24 Japanese patients with primary osteoporosis. The patients were divided into two groups, with each group receiving a single injection of zoledronic acid (4 or 5 mg). Pharmacokinetics and urinary excretion were then compared, and drug related adverse events and changes in the levels of bone turnover markers were assessed at 12 months. Mean plasma concentrations of zoledronic acid peaked in both groups immediately after administration, and decreased to 1% or less of peak levels after 24 h. Noncompartmental analysis revealed that C (max) and the area under the curve from time zero to infinity increased in proportion to the dose. The levels of bone resorption and formation markers decreased from day 15 and from 3 months after administration respectively, and suppression of these markers remained constant for the entire study period. No serious adverse events were reported. There was no large difference between the 4  and 5 mg groups in terms of pharmacokinetics, changes in the levels of bone turnover markers, and safety profiles. This study demonstrated acceptable pharmacokinetics and changes in bone metabolism associated with zoledronic acid treatment in female Japanese osteoporosis patients. Both the 4 mg dose and the 5 mg dose demonstrated acceptable safety and sustained antiresorptive effects for the duration of the study.

TI Cabozantinib Affects Osteosarcoma Growth Through A Direct Effect On

AB Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant tumor of the bone. Due to its high heterogeneity and to survival signals from bone microenvironment, OS can resist to standard treatments, therefore novel therapies are needed. c MET oncogene, a tyrosine kinase receptor, plays a crucial role in OS initiation and progression. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of c MET inhibitor cabozantinib (CBZ) on OS both directly and through its action on bone microenvironment. We tested different doses of CBZ in in vitro models of OS alone or in co culture with bone cells in order to reproduce OS tumor microenvironment interactions. CBZ is able to decrease proliferation and migration of OS cells, inhibiting ERK and AKT signaling pathways. Furthermore, CBZ leads to the inhibition of the proliferation of OS cells expressing receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK), due to its effect on bone microenvironment, where it causes an overproduction of osteoprotegerin and a decrease of production of RANK ligand by osteoblasts. Overall, our data demonstrate that CBZ might represent a new potential treatment against OS, affecting both OS cells and their microenvironment. In this scenario, RANK expression in OS cells could represent a predictive factor of better response to CBZ treatment.

TI Proliferation coupled osteoclast differentiation by RANKL: Cell density
   as a determinant of osteoclast formation

ID COLONY STIMULATING FACTOR; IDENTIFICATION; DEMETHYLATION; MECHANISMS
AB Although it is widely recognized that the osteoclast differentiation induced by RANKL is linked to the anti proliferative activity of the cytokine, we report here that RANKL in the presence of M CSF actually stimulates DNA synthesis and cell proliferation during the early proliferative phase (0 48 h) of osteoclastogenesis ex vivo, while the same cytokine exerts an anti proliferative activity in the latter half (48 96 h). A tracing of the individual cells using Fucci cell cycle indicators showed that waves of active DNA synthesis in the S phase during the period 0 48 h are followed by cell cycle arrest and cell fusion after 48 h. Inhibition of DNA synthesis with hydroxyurea (HU) during the first half almost completely inhibited osteoclastogenesis; however, the same HU treated cells, when re plated at 48 h at increasing cell densities, exhibited restored osteoclast formation, suggesting that a sufficient number of cells, rather than prior DNA synthesis, is the most critical requirement for osteoclast formation. In addition, varying either the number of bone marrow macrophages at the start of osteoclastogenic cultures or pre osteoclasts halfway through the process had a substantial impact on the number of osteoclasts that finally formed, as well as the timing of the peak of osteoclast formation. Thus, caution should be exerted in the performance of any manipulative procedure, whether pharmacological or genetic, that affects the cell number prior to cell fusion. Such procedures can have a profound effect on the number of osteoclasts that form, the final outcome of "differentiation", leading to misinterpretation of the results.

AB Background: Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO(2)NPs) are potent scavengers of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Their antioxidant properties make CeO(2)NPs promising therapeutic agents for bone diseases and bone tissue engineering. However, the effects of CeO(2)NPs on intracellular ROS production in osteoclasts (OCs) are still unclear. Numerous studies have reported that intracellular ROS are essential for osteoclastogenesis. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of CeO(2)NPs on osteoclast differentiation and the potential underlying mechanisms.
   Methods: The bidirectional modulation of osteoclast differentiation by CeO(2)NPs was explored by different methods, such as fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT PCR), and Western blotting. The cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects of CeO(2)NPs were detected by cell counting kit (CCK 8) assay, TdT mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and flow cytometry.
   Results: The results of this study demonstrated that although CeO(2)NPs were capable of scavenging ROS in acellular environments, they facilitated the production of ROS in the acidic cellular environment during receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) dependent osteoclast differentiation of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs). CeO(2)NPs at lower concentrations (4.0 mu g/mL to 8.0 mu g/mL) promoted osteoclast formation, as shown by increased expression of Nfatcl and C Fos, F actin ring formation and bone resorption. However, at higher concentrations (greater than 16.0 mu g/mL), CeO(2)NPs inhibited osteoclast differentiation and promoted apoptosis of BM,Ms by reducing Bcl2 expression and increasing the expression of cleaved caspase 3, which may be due to the overproduction of ROS.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that CeO(2)NPs facilitate osteoclast formation at lower concentrations while inhibiting osteoclastogenesis in vitro by inducing the apoptosis of BMMs at higher concentrations by modulating cellular ROS levels.

AB Background Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease that results in alveolar bone resorption due to inflammatory cytokine production induced by bacterial antigens such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Here, the preventive effect of the Amyl 1 18 peptide derived from rice in an experimental model of periodontitis and the effect on the anti inflammatory response were assessed. Methods Alveolar bone resorption, gene transcription of proinflammatory cytokines in the gingiva, and the endotoxin level in the oral cavity were evaluated after oral administration of the Amyl 1 18 peptide for 14 days using a ligature induced periodontitis model in mice. Additionally, murine macrophages were incubated with LPS of Escherichia coli or Porphyromonas gingivalis in the presence of Amyl 1 18 to analyze the suppressive effects of Amyl 1 18 on the cell signaling pathways associated with proinflammatory cytokine production, including inflammasome activities. Results Oral administration of Amyl 1 18 suppressed alveolar bone resorption and gene transcription of interleukin (il)6 in the gingiva of the periodontitis model, and decreased endotoxin levels in the oral cavity, suggesting modulation of periodontal inflammation by inhibition of endotoxin activities in vivo. Also, Amyl 1 18 suppressed IL 6 production induced by LPS and recombinant IL 1 beta in macrophages in vitro but had no effect on inflammasome activity. Conclusions The Amyl 1 18 peptide from rice inhibited alveolar bone destruction in mouse periodontitis model via suppressing inflammatory cytokine production induced by LPS. It was suggested that Amyl 1 18 peptide has anti inflammatory property against LPS, not only by neutralization of LPS and subsequent inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B signaling but also by inhibition of the IL 1R related signaling cascade.

AB The aging of the global population has made postmenopausal osteoporosis prevention essential; however, pharmacological treatments are limited. Herein, we evaluate the effect of calcium fortified fresh milk (FM) in ameliorating postmenopausal osteoporosis in a rat model established using bilateral ovariectomy. After 3 months of FM (containing vitamin D, and casein phosphopeptides, 1 000 mg Ca/100 g) or control milk (110 mg Ca/100 g milk) supplementation, bone changes were assessed using dual energy X ray absorptiometry, microcomputed tomography, and bone biomechanical testing. The results revealed that FM can regulate bone metabolism and gut microbiota composition, which act on bone metabolism through pathways associated with steroid hormone biosynthesis, relaxin signaling, serotonergic synapse, and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. Furthermore, FM administration significantly increased bone mineral content and density in the lumbar spine and femur, as well as femoral compressive strength, while improving femoral trabecular bone parameters and microarchitecture. Mechanistically, we found that the effects may be due to increased levels of estrogen, bone formation marker osteocalcin, and procollagen type I N propeptide, and decreased expression of the bone resorption marker C telopeptide and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase 5b. Overall, the findings suggest that FM is a potential alternative therapeutic option for ameliorating postmenopausal osteoporosis. (c) 2024 Beijing Academy of Food Sciences.

AB Galectin 3 is a beta galactoside binding animal lectin having pleiotropic effects on cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. This lectin has been shown to be involved in phagocytosis by macrophages and in inflammation. Here we investigated an involvement of galectin 3 in the regulatory process of inflammatory bone resorption in rats with adjuvant induced arthritis (AA rats) accompanying severe bone destruction in the ankle joints. The protein level of galectin 3 in the ankle joint extracts was markedly augmented at week 3 after adjuvant injection, at the time when severe bone destruction was observed. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed an extremely high expression of galectin 3 in macrophages and granulocytes infiltrated in the area of severe bone destruction. To estimate the role of galectin 3 in osteoclastogenesis and osteoclastic bone resorption, recombinant galectin 3 was added to in vitro culture systems. Galectin 3 markedly inhibited the formation of osteoclasts in cultures of murine osteoclast precursor cell line as well as in rat bone marrow culture systems. This inhibition was not observed by heat inactivated galectin 3 or by galectin 7. Although recombinant galectin 3 did not affect signaling through mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) or nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B), it specifically suppressed the induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). Galectin 3 significantly inhibited dentine resorption by mature osteoclasts in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo studies clearly showed a significant suppression of bone destruction and osteoclast recruitment accompanying arthritis, when galectin 3 was injected into the cavity of ankle joint of AA rats. Thus, abundant galectin 3 observed in the area of severe bone destruction may act as a negative regulator for the upregulated osteoclastogenesis accompanying inflammation to prevent excess bone destruction.

AB Osteoporosis, which is characterized by low bone mineral density and susceptibility to fracture, is caused by increased osteoclastic activity. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL)/RANK signaling plays an important role in osteoclast differentiation and activation. The current treatment strategies for osteoporosis do not directly address this underlying cause and generates undesired side effects. This led to emergence of controlled delivery systems to increase drug bioavailability and efficacy specifically at the bone tissue. With better understanding of molecular pathology of bone, the use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to inhibit translation of abnormal gene expression in cells is becoming a promising approach. In this study, we report a siRNA delivery system consisting of PEI:RANK siRNA complex entrapped in nanosized poly(lactic acid co glycolic acid) (PLGA) capsules intended to be used in the treatment of osteoporosis. The nanosize will enable the nanoparticles to be administered by intravenous injection. The RANK siRNA was complexed with polyethylenimine (PEI) and loaded into biodegradable PLGA nanocapsules (NCs). The PEI:RANK siRNA loaded nanocapsules significantly reduced (47%) RANK mRNA levels. The differentiation of osteoclast precursors to mature osteoclasts was significantly suppressed (approximate to 54%). The reduction in the osteoclastic activity of the differentiated osteoclasts (55%) was found to be statistically significant. The siRNA delivery system developed in the study is planned to be tested i.v. in mouse and has the potential to be used as a novel alternative approach for the systemic treatment of osteoporosis.

AB The in vitro osteogenic differentiation has been intensively studied. However, it is not yet clear precisely how osteogenesis can be optimized. Changes in extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](e)), as well as modulation of purinergic receptors play an important role in the regulation of osteoblasts differentiation and bone formation. In this study, we investigated the effects of a combined treatment of ATP S and high [Ca2+](e) (5.35mM) on osteogenic differentiation and function of primary cell cultures from rat calvaria. Our results indicate that ATP S stimulates cell transition from the G(0) to S phase of cell cycle, involving the PI3K signaling pathway. Treatment with 10 or 100 mu M ATP S and [Ca2+](e) (ATP [Ca2+](e)) for 48h increases cell number significantly above the control. ATP S treatment in osteogenic medium containing [Ca2+](e) stimulates the gene expression of BMP 4, BMP 5, and OPN at 16, 48, and 72h, respectively, above control. In same conditions, treatment for 6 days with 10 mu M UTP or 100 mu M UDP significantly increased the ALP activity respect to control. Cells grown in osteogenic medium showed a statistically significant increase in calcium deposits at 15 and 18 days, for 10 mu M ATP S treatment, and at 18 and 22 days, for [Ca2+](e) treatment, respect to control but ATP [Ca2+](e) treatment shown a significant greater mineralization at 15 days respect to ATP S, and at 18 days respect to both agonists. In conclusion, we demonstrated that an osteogenic medium containing 10 mu M ATP S and 5.35mM [Ca2+](e) enhance osteogenesis and mineralization by rat primary calvarial cells cultures. J. Cell.

AB Synovium derived mesenchymal stromal cells (SMSCs) may play an important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and show promise for therapeutic applications in RA. In this study, a whole genome microarray analysis was used to detect differential gene expression in SMSCs from RA patients and healthy donors (HDs). Our results showed that there were 4828 differentially expressed genes in the RA group compared to the HD group; 3117 genes were upregulated, and 1711 genes were downregulated. A Gene Ontology analysis showed significantly enriched terms of differentially expressed genes in the biological process, cellular component, and molecular function domains. A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that the MAPK signaling and rheumatoid arthritis pathways were upregulated and that the p53 signaling pathway was downregulated in RA SMSCs. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction was applied to verify the expression variations of the partial genes mentioned above, and a western blot analysis was used to determine the expression levels of p53, p JNK, p ERK, and p p38. Our study found that differentially expressed genes in the MAPK signaling, rheumatoid arthritis, and p53 signaling pathways may help to explain the pathogenic mechanism of RA and lead to therapeutic RA SMSC applications.

AB Objective: To analyze gene expression profiles analysis during the differentiation of sheep muscle derived stem cells (MDSCs) into smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in sheep. Methods: A modified preplate technique was employed to isolation of the MDSCs from sheep. The MDSCs were subjected to flow cytometry analysis targeting CD44, CD31, CD45, CD14, and CD49f and were treated with TGF beta 1 at a concentration of 10 ng/ml for ten days. The expression levels of smooth muscle alpha actin (alpha SMA) and calponin after treatment with TGF beta 1 were determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. A microarray analysis was performed to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during MDSC differentiation using total RNA extracted from MDSCs and SMCs generated from MDSCs. Molecule Annotation System (MAS) 3.0, which employs KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and GO (Gene Ontology) Consortium annotations, was used to identify global biological trends in the gene expression data. Results: The expression levels of the SMC specific contractile proteins alpha SMA and calponin were dramatically increased after treatment with TGF beta 1. Immunofluorescece staining showed that the TGF beta 1 treated MDSCs were positive for alpha SMA. We identified 486 genes that were differentially expressed between the MDSCs and TGF beta 1 treated MDSCs. 260 of which were up regulated and 226 of which were down regulated. Twenty one genes exhibited a greater than ten fold change, 13 of which were up regulated and 8 of which were down regulated. TGF beta 1 treatment up regulated both the SMAD and MAPK signaling pathways during the differentiation of these sheep cells. The PPAR and Wnt signaling pathways were also found to be involved in the differentiation process. Conclusions: TGF beta 1 can successfully induce the differentiation of sheep MDSCs into SMCs. For the first time, we analyzed the gene expression profiles associated with this differentiation process, and the results showed that both the SMAD and MAPK signaling pathways are involved. This study indicated that multiple signaling networks coordinate the development and differentiation of MDSCs into SMCs.

AB The crucial effects of androgens on the male skeleton are at least partly mediated via the androgen receptor (AR). In addition to hormone binding, the AR activity is regulated by post translational modifications, including SUMOylation. SUMOylation is a reversible modification in which Small Ubiquitin related MOdifier proteins (SUMOs) are attached to the AR and thereby regulate the activity of the AR and change its interactions with other proteins.
   To elucidate the importance of SUMOylation of AR for male bone metabolism, we used a mouse model devoid of the two AR SUMOylation sites (AR(SUM );K381R and K500R are substituted). Six month old male AR(SUM ) mice displayed significantly reduced trabecular bone volume fraction in the distal metaphyseal region of femur compared with wild type (WT) mice (BV/TV,  19.1 +/  4.9%, P < 0.05). The number of osteoblasts per bone perimeter was substantially reduced ( 60.5 +/  7.2%, P < 0.001) while no significant effect was observed on the number of osteoclasts in the trabecular bone of male AR(SUM ) mice. Dynamic histomorphometric analysis of trabecular bone revealed a reduced bone formation rate ( 32.6 +/  7.4%, P < 0.05) as a result of reduced mineralizing surface per bone surface in AR(SUM ) mice compared with WT mice ( 24.3 +/  3.6%, P < 0.001). Furthermore, cortical bone thickness in the diaphyseal region of femur was reduced in male AR(SUM ) mice compared with WT mice ( 7.3 +/  2.0%, P < 0.05).
   In conclusion, mice devoid of AR SUMOylation have reduced trabecular bone mass as a result of reduced bone formation. We propose that therapies enhancing AR SUMOylation might result in bone specific anabolic effects with minimal adverse effects in other tissues.

TI Resveratrol prevents RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation of murine

AB The bone protective effects of resveratrol have been demonstrated in several osteoporosis models while the underlying mechanism is largely unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of resveratrol on differentiation and apoptosis of murine osteoclast progenitor RAW 264.7 cells. We found that resveratrol at non toxic concentrations dose dependently inhibited RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation and induced apoptosis. Resveratrol has been shown to be an activator of Sirt1, a NAD(+) dependent protein deacetylase, and has been demonstrated to mimic estrogen. However, we found that although Sirt1 protein was abundantly expressed in RAW264.7 cells, the specific Sirt1 inhibitor EX 527 could not attenuate the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis mediated by resveratrol. Also, the effects of resveratrol could not be attenuated by ICI 182780, a high affinity estrogen receptor antagonist. The central role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation has recently been clarified. We found that resveratrol suppressed RANKL induced ROS generation in a concentration dependent manner. We postulate that the direct inhibitory effects of resveratrol on osteoclastogenesis are mediated via inhibition of ROS generation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. Interleukin 17 (IL 17) is an important cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of bone lesions of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The aim of our study was to explore the short term effects (<= 6 months) of secukinumab (an anti IL 17 antibody) on the serum levels of bone turnover markers (BTMs) and on the inhibitors of the WNT signalling pathway.
   Methods. The study sample consisted of patients with PsA starting treatment with secukinumab 150 mg every month, and healthy controls (HCs). For the PsA group, the DAS28 score was recorded, and serum samples were collected at baseline, and then at Month 1, 3 and 6 of therapy. As for the HCs, a single observation was performed, with the relevant serum collection. Intact N terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PINP), C terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX I I), Dickkopf related protein 1 (Dkk 1) and sclerostin were administered.
   Results. 28 patients with PsA and 43 HCs were enrolled. Neither PINP nor CTX I serum levels showed any significant variation during the observation period. Baseline mean Dkk 1 serum levels for the PsA arm were significantly lower than in the HC (p<0.05). Dkk 1 and sclerostin serum levels increased at Month 6 during the treatment with secukinumab (p<0.05 vs. baseline). When the PsA arm was compared to the HC, the difference between the serum levels of Dkk 1 lost significance at Month 6.
   Conclusion. Treatment with secukinumab does not have any significant short term effect on BTMs, but may influence some fine regulators of the bone cell activity, such as the WNT inhibitors.

AB BackgroundSystemic sclerosis (SSc) is a disease that features severe fibrosis of the skin and lacks effective therapy. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are potential stem cell based tools for the treatment of SSc.MethodsBMSCs were isolated from the bone marrow of mice and identified with surface markers according to multilineage differentiation. EVs were isolated from the BMSC culture medium by ultracentrifugation and identified with a Nanosight NS300 particle size analyzer, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blot. The microRNAs (miRNAs) of BMSC derived EVs (BMSC EVs) were studied via miRNA sequencing (miRNA seq) and bioinformatic analysis. An SSc mouse model was established via subcutaneous bleomycin (BLM) injection, and the mice were treated with BMSCs or BMSC derived EVs. Skin tissues were dissociated and analyzed with H&E staining, RNA sequencing (RNA seq), western blot, and immunohistochemical staining.ResultsEvident pathological changes, like fibrosis and inflammation, were induced in the skin of BLM treated mice. BMSCs and BMSC EVs effectively intervened such pathological manifestations and disease processes in a very similar way. The effects of the BMSC EVs were found to be caused by the miRNAs they carried, which were proven to be involved in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of multiple cell types and in multiple EV related biological processes. Furthermore, TGF beta 1 positive cells and alpha  SMA positive myofibroblasts were significantly increased in the scleroderma skin of BLM treated mice but evidently reduced in the scleroderma skin of the EV treated SSc group. In addition, the numbers of mast cells and infiltrating macrophages and lymphocytes were evidently increased in the skin of BLM treated mice but significantly reduced by EV treatment. In line with these observations, there were significantly higher mRNA levels of the inflammatory cytokines Il6, Il10, and Tnf alpha in SSc mice than in control mice, but the levels decreased following EV treatment. Through bioinformatics analysis, the TGF beta and WNT signaling pathways were revealed to be closely involved in the pathogenic changes seen in mouse SSc, and these pathways could be therapeutic targets for treating the disease.ConclusionsBMSC derived EVs could be developed as a potential therapy for treating skin dysfunction in SSc, especially considering that they show similar efficacy to BMSCs but have fewer developmental regulatory requirements than cell therapy. The effects of EVs are generated by the miRNAs they carry, which alleviate SSc pathogenic changes by regulating the WNT and TGF beta signaling pathways.

AB Background: Bone tissue is one of the main sites for breast metastasis; patients diagnosed with advanced breast cancer mostly develop bone metastasis characterized by severe osteolytic lesions, which heavily influence their life quality. Low Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound (LIPUS) is a form of mechanical energy able to modulate various molecular pathways both in cancer and in health cells.
   The purpose of the present study was to evaluate for the first time, the ability of LIPUS to modulate osteolytic capability of breast cancer cells.
   Methods: Two different approaches were employed: a) Indirect method  conditioned medium obtained by MDA MB 231 cell line treated or untreated with LIPUS was used to induce osteoclast differentiation of murine macrophage Raw264.7 cell line; and b) Direct method  MDA MB 231 were co cultured with Raw264.7 cells and treated or untreated with LIPUS.
   Results: LIPUS treatment impaired MDA MB 231 cell dependentosteoclast differentiation and produced a reduction of osteoclast markers such as Cathepsin K, Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 and Tartrate Resistant Acid Phosphatase, suggesting its role as an effective and safe adjuvant in bone metastasis management.
   Conclusion: LIPUS treatment could be a good and safety therapeutic adjuvant in osteolyitic bone metastasis not only for the induction properties of bone regeneration, but also for the reduction of osteolysis.

TI Cannabinoid receptor type 2 gene is associated with human osteoporosis
SO HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS
LA English
DT Article
ID BONE MINERAL DENSITY; COMPONENT LINKAGE ANALYSIS; LOCI
AB Osteoporosis is one of the most common degenerative diseases. It is characterized by reduced bone mineral density (BMD) with an increased risk for bone fractures. There is a substantial genetic contribution to BMD, although the genetic factors involved in the pathogenesis of human osteoporosis are largely unknown. Mice with a targeted deletion of either the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (Cnr1) or type 2 (Cnr2) gene show an alteration of bone mass, and pharmacological modification of both receptors can regulate osteoclast activity and BMD. We therefore analyzed both genes in a systematic genetic association study in a human sample of postmenopausal osteoporosis patients and matched female controls. We found a significant association of single polymorphisms (P = 0.0014) and haplotypes (P = 0.0001) encompassing the CNR2 gene on human chromosome 1p36, whereas we found no convincing association for CNR1. These results demonstrate a role for the peripherally expressed CB2 receptor in the etiology of osteoporosis and provide an interesting novel therapeutical target for this severe and common disease.

AB Fufang Zhenzhu Tiaozhi (FTZ), as an effective traditional Chinese medicine, has been prescribed for more than 20 years. It has proven clinical efficacy as a prescription for patients with dyslipidemia, glucocorticoid  and high fat induced osteoporosis, but its effect on osteoporosis induced by aging is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti osteoporosis effect of FTZ in aging mice and revealed its biochemical action mechanism using metabolomics. Model of primary osteoporosis induced by aging was established. The mice in treatment group received a therapeutic dose of oral FTZ extract once daily during the experiment. The model and control groups received the corresponding volume of oral normal saline solution. Plasma samples of all three groups were collected after 12 weeks. Clinical biochemical parameters and biomechanics were determined in the osteoporosis model induced by normal aging to evaluate anti osteoporosis effect of FTZ. Ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC QTOF/MS) was used to analyze metabolic changes. The changes of histomorphometric and biomechanic parameters of femurs, as well as osteoblast and osteoclast activity indicated that FTZ administration reduced the risk of osteoporosis. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS DA) score plot revealed a clear separation trend between model and controls. Moreover, PLS DA score plot indicated the anti osteoporosis effect of FTZ with sphingosine 1 phosphate, LPA (16:0) and arachidonic acid (AA) among key biomarkers. The pivotal pathways revealed by pathway analysis including sphingolipid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and M metabolism. The mechanism by which FTZ reduces the risk of primary age related osteoporosis in mice might be related to disorders of the above mentioned pathways. FTZ has a protective effect against osteoporosis induced by aging, which may be mediated via interference with sphingolipid, glycerophospholipid, and AA metabolisms in mice.

AB Importance Denosumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), is a widely used antiresorptive medication for osteoporosis treatment. Recent preclinical studies indicate that inhibition of RANKL signaling improves insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and beta cell proliferation, suggesting that denosumab may improve glucose homeostasis; however, whether denosumab reduces the risk of incident diabetes remains unclear.
   Objective To evaluate whether denosumab use is associated with a lower risk of developing diabetes in patients with osteoporosis.
   Design, Setting, and Participants This nationwide, propensity score matched cohort study used administrative data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Adult patients who received denosumab for osteoporosis therapy in Taiwan between 2012 and 2019 were included. To eliminate the inherent bias from confounding by indication, the patients were categorized into a treatment group (34 255 patients who initiated denosumab treatment and adhered to it) and a comparison group (34 255 patients who initiated denosumab treatment but discontinued it after the initial dose) according to the administration status of the second dose of denosumab. Propensity score matching was performed to balance patient characteristics and to control for confounders.
   Exposure Treatment with denosumab.
   Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was incident diabetes requiring treatment with antidiabetic drugs. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for incident diabetes. Data were analyzed from January 1 to November 30, 2023.
   Results After propensity score matching, 68 510 patients were included (mean [SD] age, 77.7 [9.8] years; 57 762 [84.3%] female). During a mean (SD) follow up of 1.9 (1.6) years, 2016 patients developed diabetes in the treatment group and 3220 developed diabetes in the comparison group (incidence rate, 35.9 vs 43.6 per 1000 person years). Compared with the comparison group, denosumab treatment was associated with a lower risk of incident diabetes (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78 0.90). Several sensitivity analyses also demonstrated similar results of lower diabetes risk associated with denosumab treatment.
   Conclusions and relevance The results from this cohort study indicating that denosumab treatment was associated with lower risk of incident diabetes may help physicians choose an appropriate antiosteoporosis medication for patients with osteoporosis while also considering the risk of diabetes.

AB Zoledronic acid (ZA) is the most widely used bisphosphonate to treat cancer induced bone disease. There is evidence that bisphosphonates have direct antitumor activity and that their combination with anticancer agents can significantly enhance the effect of treatment. We evaluated whether the combination of ZA with different platinum compounds exerts a synergistic effect in breast cancer cell lines and we investigated the mechanisms of action involved. This study was performed on four breast cancer cell lines, MCF 7, SKBR3, MDA MB 231 and BRC 230, and confirmed on a primary culture obtained from a breast cancer bone metastasis specimen. ZA (50 mu M) was administered for 72 h alone or in combination with cisplatin (Cis) or carboplatin. Drug induced growth inhibition was detected by sulforhodamine B assay, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation were detected by flow cytometry, and protein expression was evaluated by western blot analysis. MCF 7 and SKBR3 showed very low sensitivity to the three drugs tested. The ZA + Cis combination exerted a high antitumor activity in the two triple negative lines MDA MB 231 and BRC 230. An important synergistic effect was obtained in MDA MB 231 and an additive effect was observed in BRC 230. The p21, pMAPK and m TOR pathways were regulated by this combined treatment, particularly at lower Cis doses. Carboplatin did not show antitumor activity either alone or in combination with ZA. In conclusion, the potential novel treatment schedule identified for triple negative breast cancer could prove beneficial in view of the limited therapeutic options available for patients and also since the synergism with ZA would enable lower Cis doses to be used, thus reducing toxicity. Although further research in a clinical setting is warranted, our results on cell lines has been confirmed on a human primary bone metastasis culture.

AB Defective autophagy occurred in osteoblasts under stress induced by high glucose and played an essential role in the development of diabetic osteoporosis. Timosaponin BII, a steroidal saponin isolated from the rhizomes of Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge, possessed anti osteoporosis properties. In this study, we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of timosaponin BII on diabetic osteoporosis. Timosaponin BII attenuated the deterioration in the microarchitecture of the tibias in diabetic rats. Furthermore, treatment with timosaponin BII dose dependently reduced hyperglycemia induced cell apoptosis in primary osteoblasts from rat calvaria. High glucose exposed osteoblasts exhibited increased mitochondrial superoxide level, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and impaired autophagic flux, which was attenuated by timosaponin BII, as evidenced by the upregulation of autophagosome numbers, LC3B puncta formation and Beclin1 expression. The antiapoptotic and antioxidative effect of timosaponin BII were repressed by the autophagy inhibitor 3 methyladenine and enhanced by the autophagy inducer rapamycin. Further studies showed that timosaponin BII suppressed the phosphorylation of mTOR and S6K, as well as the downstream factors NF kappa B and I kappa B, consequently activating autophagy and decreasing apoptosis. Of note, coincubation of timosaponin BII with MHY1485, a pharmacological activator of mTOR, diminished the protein expression of Bc12 induced by timosaponin BII, which was in parallel with decreased autophagy and increased phosphorylation of NF kappa B and I kappa B. Overexpression of NF kappa B reduced timosaponin BII evoked autophagy and promoted apoptosis. The in vivo results showed that oral administration of timosaponin BII downregulated the phosphorylation of mTOR and NF kappa B and upregulated Beclinl expression in the proximal tibias of diabetic rats. These results suggested that timosaponin BII attenuated high glucose induced oxidative stress and apoptosis through activating autophagy by inhibiting mTOR/NF kappa B signalling in osteoblasts.

AB Simvastatin has been shown to stimulate osteogenic cell differentiation. Our previous study showed osteoblasts on trabecular surface are increased by simvastatin treatment in animal study. However, whether simvastatin stimulates osteoblast proliferation and by what molecular mechanism have not been adequately investigated. Because the mitochondrial function is crucial for cell survival and proliferation, we hypothesize that simvastatin may promote human osteoblast (hOBs) proliferation and it may be related to mitochondrial function. Our results showed that simvastatin significantly enhanced proliferation and increased both mRNA and protein levels of cyclin D2, Bcl 2 and the ratio of Bcl 2 to Bax (Bcl 2/Bax). Furthermore, simvastatin increased mitochondrial activity and ATP content of hOBs. Most importantly, treatment with ATP synthase blocker, oligomycin, significantly decreased both simvastatin stimulated ATP content and cell proliferation, and completely reversed the simvastatin induced up regulation of cyclin D2 and Bcl 2 expression in hOBs. On the other hand, rotenone, the complex I blocker, also partially blocked simvastatin stimulated ATP content and cell proliferation, but the blocker did not suppress the effect of simvastatin on cyclin D2 and Bcl 2 expression. These results indicate that the up regulation of cyclin D2 and Bcl 2/Bax by simvastatin depends on the intact function of ATP synthase in the mitochondria of hOBs. It suggests that simvastatin may promote hOB proliferation, at least partly, via up regulating mitochondrial function and subsequently cyclin D2 and Bcl 2/Bax expression. The findings provide new information for the basic medical science in bone physiology and for new therapy strategy of simvastatin on bone formation in future. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Brief rationale: Zoledronic acid treatment against osteoporosis is limited by APR. Main result: Combination therapy (hydrocortisone plus non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, and prednisolone) reduced intolerable APR levels and provided complete symptom relief in most patients. Significance of the paper: Combination therapy can enhance patient outcomes in osteoporosis management. Purpose Osteoporosis is a common condition associated with high morbidity rates, often requiring treatment with bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid. However, the persistence to zoledronic acid infusion is commonly limited by acute phase response (APR). This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel combination therapy in preventing APR symptoms. Methods A retrospective case control study was conducted on 931 patients who received their first zoledronic acid infusion between 2011 and 2021. We evaluated the efficacy of combination therapy comprising a single dose of hydrocortisone prior to the infusion and a 3 d oral regimen of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, and prednisolone following the infusion. Patients were divided into protocol (receiving combination therapy) and control groups (without treatment). Baseline characteristics, APR incidence, and the efficacy of symptom control were compared between groups using Fisher's exact test and Student's t test. Results There was no difference in APR incidence between the protocol (n = 507) and control group (n = 407; p = 0.1442). However, the protocol group exhibited lower intolerable APR levels (3.72% vs. 16.71%; p < 0.0001) and complete symptom relief in 96.28% of cases. Conclusion The combination therapy protocol effectively reduced intolerable APR and relieved symptoms in most patients following zoledronic acid infusion. This study highlights the importance of proactive management strategies for APR and emphasizes the potential of combination therapy in alleviating APR symptoms and reducing the occurrence of severe APR in patients undergoing osteoporosis management.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: The deficiency of kidney Yin is the main pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) according to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Zuoguiwan (ZGW) is among the classical prescriptions in TCM and has been applied to various diseases that are due to deficiency of kidney Yin, including osteoporosis, fractures, menopausal syndromes. However, the underlying mechanism of ZGW in treating PMOP remains poorly understood.
   Aim of the study: ZGW, a traditional Chinese prescription, has been used to nourish Yin and reinforce the kidney since ancient times. The investigation aimed to explore the mechanism of ZGW via the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) signaling pathway as mediated by the beta 2 adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR) in an osteoporosis rat model.
   Materials and methods: An osteoporosis model induced by ovariectomy was established in rats. A total of 40 female Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned into bilateral ovariectomy group (OVX), sham operated group (Sham), 17 beta estradiol treated positive group (E2, 25 mu g/kg/d), ZGW low dose group (ZGW L, 2.3 g/kg/d lyophilized powder) and ZGW high dose group (ZGW H, 4.6 g/kg/d lyophilized powder). The serum markers of bone turnover were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The morphological structure changes in bones were detected through H&E staining. Local bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone microarchitecture of the right distal femur were measured and evaluated by using micro CT. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein expressions levels of beta 2AR, OPG and RANKL were measured by qPCR and Western blot analysis.
   Results: Compared with the OVX group, ZGW groups showed significantly reduced levels of serum tartrate resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP 5b) and beta cross linked c telopeptide of type I collagen (beta CTX) (P < 0.01), increased levels of serum bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) (P < 0.01) and OPG (P < 0.05), prevention of OVX induced bone loss, and improved microarchitecture of the trabecular bone of distal femur. Moreover, ZGW mediated the osteoporosis syndrome by reducing the empty bone lacunae, promoting the ordered arrangement of trabeculae structure, and increasing the trabeculae structure thickness. Furthermore, in ZGW groups, the protein expression of OPG in the tibia was notably up regulated (P < 0.01), whereas the mRNA and protein expression of beta 2AR in the hippocampus (P < 0.01), and the protein expressions levels of beta 2AR (P < 0.01) and RANKL (P< 0.05) in the tibia were down regulated compared with OVX group.
   Conclusions: ZGW through its protective effects, stimulates bone formation and suppresses bone resorption. The underlying mechanism of ZGW in improving perimenopausal syndrome and increasing bone mass might be attributed to the regulation of RANKL/OPG, as mediated by beta 2AR. Therefore, ZGW may be used as an alternative treatment for PMOP.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Mortis bombycis Koidzumi is widely distributed in Asia. In Korea, it has been used in traditional medicine because of its apparent anti inflammatory, antioxidant, and hepatoprotective properties.
   Aim of the study: Although the extract of Morus bombycis Koidzumi (MB) has long since been used as a traditional anti inflammatory medicine in Korea, its effect on arthritis remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the anti arthritis activity of MB and the mechanism underlying it.
   Materials and methods: The anti arthritis activity of MB was assessed by using mouse models of type II collagen induced arthritis (CIA). The clinical arthritis index and histopathological changes were evaluated in mice. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and other biologic approaches were used for measuring the effect of MB on arthritis and understanding the underlying mechanism.
   Results: MB significantly decreased the clinical arthritis index in CIA mice; this was confirmed by examining histological changes in joints. Infiltration of immune cells, synovial hyperplasia, cartilage destruction, and bone erosion in the hind paw were largely suppressed by MB. The mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1/MMP 3, inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNE) alpha, interleukin (IL) 1 beta, IL 6), and chemokines (macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 1, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) 1, RANTES) were significantly suppressed by MB in a dose dependent manner. The number of osteoclasts in the hind tibia was also significantly decreased. With regard to the mechanism, MB suppressed the activation of nuclear factor (NF) kappa B and activator protein (AP) 1 in CIA mice.
   Conclusions: MB produced an anti arthritis effect in CIA mice by inhibiting the production of critical inflammatory mediators and osteoclasts through the downregulation of NF kappa B and AP 1. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel aptamer based competitive drug screening platform for osteoporosis was devised in which fluorescence labeled, sclerostin specific aptamers compete with compounds from selected chemical libraries for the binding of immobilized recombinant human sclerostin to achieve high throughput screening for potential small molecule sclerostin inhibitors and to facilitate drug repurposing and drug discovery. Of the 96 selected inhibitors and FDA approved drugs, six were shown to result in a significant decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the aptamer, suggesting a higher affinity toward sclerostin compared with that of the aptamer. The targets of these potential sclerostin inhibitors were correlated to lipid or bone metabolism, and several of the compounds have already been shown to be potential osteogenic activators, indicating that the aptamer based competitive drug screening assay offered a potentially reliable strategy for the discovery of target specific new drugs. The six potential sclerostin inhibitors suppressed the level of both intracellular and/or extracellular sclerostin in mouse osteocyte IDG SW3 and increased alkaline phosphatase activity in IDG SW3 cells, human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells and human fetal osteoblasts hFOB1.19. Potential small molecule drug candidates obtained in this study are expected to provide new therapeutics for osteoporosis as well as insights into the structure activity relationship of sclerostin inhibitors for rational drug design.

AB Kanazawa I, Yamaguchi T, Yano S, Yamauchi M, Sugimoto T. Activation of AMP kinase and inhibition of Rho kinase induce the mineralization of osteoblastic MC3T3 E1 cells through endothelial NOS and BMP 2 expression. Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 296: E139 E146, 2009. First published November 11, 2008; doi: 10.1152/ajpendo.90677.2008. AMP activated protein kinase ( AMPK) and Rho kinase (ROK) are known to modulate the mevalonate pathway. Activation of AMPK suppresses 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A (CoA) reductase. ROK acts downstream of HMG CoA reductase, and its inhibition exerts anti atherosclerosis effects. However, whether or not these enzymes are involved in bone metabolism is unclear. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of an AMPK activator, 5 aminoimidazole 4 carboxamide1 beta D ribonucleoside ( AICAR), and a ROK inhibitor, fasudil hydrochrolide, on the mineralization of osteoblastic MC3T3 E1 cells. Real time PCR and mineralization stainings revealed that both AICAR and fasudil significantly stimulated endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP 2), and osteocalcin mRNA expression as well as mineralization in the cells. Supplementation of either mevalonate or geranyl geranyl pyrophosphate, the downstream molecules of HMG CoA reductase, or coincubation with either a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N G nitro L arginine methyl ester, or a BMP 2 antagonist, noggin, significantly reversed these AICAR induced reactions. Western blot analysis showed that AICAR activated protein kinase B and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK). ERK inhibitor significantly reversed the AICAR induced increase in eNOS and BMP 2 mRNA expression. Measurement of ROK activities by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay revealed that both AICAR and fasudil significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of the myosin binding subunit of myosin phosphate, a ROK substrate. These findings suggest that the AMPK activator and the ROK inhibitor are able to stimulate the mineralization of osteoblasts through modulating the mevalonate pathway. These agents could be candidate drugs that promote bone formation for the treatment of osteoporosis.

AB The antiresorptive agents still are the mainstay of osteoporosis treatment. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of recombinant Lingzhi 8 (rLZ 8) on osteoclast in vitro and bone resorption in vivo. The rLZ 8 protein was derived from Ganoderma lucidum transformation and produced by a genetic system. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand induced RAW 264.7 cells to differentiate into osteoclastic cells in vitro. Cells were exposed to different doses of rLZ 8 for 7 days to measure differences of osteoclastic differentiation, apoptosis rate and gene expression. rLZ 8 was labeled with Alexa Fluor 568 to observe its intracellular distribution under super resolution light microscopy. In addition, retinoic acid was administered to female rats for 14 days to develop osteopenia changes. Different doses of rLZ 8 were simultaneously administered to rats treated with retinoic acid to observe changes of bone mineral density, biochemical parameters and organ weight ratio. Results indicated that rLZ 8 regulated receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK)   tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6)   c Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway, by which rLZ 8 inhibited osteoclastic differentiation and promoted osteoclastic apoptosis. Through 3D structured illumination microscopy, it was observed that rLZ 8 entered RAW264.7 cells and accumulated gradually into the cytoplasm but lithe into nucleus. Administration with rLZ 8 reversed loss of bone mass and improved ALP activity in osteoporotic rats. Low to high dose rLZ 8 treatments displayed lithe toxic effects on rat organs and did not seem to impact their overall health. All data suggested that rLZ 8 has possible action against osteoporosis.

AB Using sodium dodecyl sulphate micelles as template, hollow cored calcium phosphate nanocapsules were produced. The surfaces of the nanocapsule were subsequently silanised by a polyethylene glycol (PEG) based silane with an N hydroxy succinimide ester end groups which permits for further attachment with bisphosphonates (BP). Characterisations of these nanocapsules were investigated using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy, Fourier Transform Infra Red Spectroscopy, X ray diffraction, X ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Dynamic Light Scattering. To further validate the bone targeting potential, dentine discs were incubated with these functionalised nanocapsules. FESEM analysis showed that these surface modified nanocapsules would bind strongly to dentine surfaces compared to non functionalised nanocapsules. We envisage that respective components would give this construct a bifunctional attribute, whereby (1) the shell of the calcium phosphate nanocapsule would serve as biocompatible coating aiding in gradual osteoconduction, while (2) surface BP moieties, acting as targeting ligands, would provide the bone targeting potential of these calcium phosphate nanocapsules.

AB The combined incidence and the extended disease course of breast and prostate cancer is a major challenge for health care systems. The solution for society requires an economically viable treatment strategy to maintain individuals disease free and productive, so as to avoid the fracture of the family unit. Forty years ago, translational research using the antiestrogen tamoxifen was targeted to estrogen receptor (ER) positive micrometastatic tumor cells and established the long term anti hormone adjuvant treatment strategy used universally today. The anti hormone strategy was the accepted structure of cancer biology. Sex steroid deprivation therapy remains the orthodox strategy for the treatment of both breast and prostate cancer.
   Despite major initial therapeutic success, the strategies of long term anti hormone therapies with either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors (AI) or anti androgens or abiraterone for breast and prostate cancer, respectively, eventually lead to a significant proportion of anti hormone resistant or stimulated tumor growth. Remarkably, a general principle of anti hormone resistance has emerged for both breast and prostate cancer based primarily on clinical and supportive laboratory data. Paradoxically, anti hormone resistant cell populations emerge and grow but are vulnerable to the cytotoxicity of estrogen or androgen induced apoptosis for both breast and prostate cancer, respectively. These consistent anticancer actions of sex steroids appear to recapitulate the more complex mechanism of bone remodeling in elderly men and women during sex steroid deprivation. Estrogen is the key hormone in both sexes because in men androgen is first converted to estrogen. Estrogen regulates and triggers apoptosis in osteoclasts that develop during estrogen deprivation and destroy bone to cause osteoporosis. Sex steroid deprived breast and prostate cancer has recruited a streamlined natural apoptotic program from the human genome, but this is suppressed in the majority of sex steroid deprived tumors. Targeted strategies to neutralize cell survival pathways are now required to amplify and enhance sex steroid induced apoptosis. Successful blockade of the critical pathways for cell survival will introduce an inexpensive targeted therapy to maintain breast and prostate cancer patients indefinitely. Rotating anti hormonal and sex steroid targeted cocktails could maintain patients at a microscopic tumor burden to enhance the quality of life, enhance survival, and maintain the family as a self supporting and economically productive unit within society.

AB The approach to patients with acute pain begins by identifying the underlying cause and a disease specific treatment. The first line pharmacologic agent for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate pain is acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug (NSAID). The choice between these two medications depends on the type of pain and patient risk factors for NSAID related adverse effects (e.g., gastrointestinal, renovascular, or cardiovascular effects). Different NSAIDs have similar analgesic effects. However, cyclooxygenase 2 selective NSAIDs (e.g., celecoxib) must be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and are more expensive than nonselective NSAIDs. If these first line agents are not sufficient for mild to moderate pain, medications that target separate pathways simultaneously, such as an acetaminophen/opioid combination, are reasonable choices. Severe acute pain is typically treated with potent opioids. At each step, adjuvant medications directed at the underlying condition can be used. Newer medications with dual actions (e.g., tapentadol) are also an option. There is little evidence that one opioid is superior for pain control, but there are some pharmacologic differences among opioids. Because of the growing misuse and diversion of controlled substances, caution should be used when prescribing opioids, even for short term treatment. Patients should be advised to properly dispose of unused medications. (Am Fam Physician. 2013;87(11):766 772. Copyright (C) 2013 American Academy of Family Physicians.)

AB Mesenchymal Stromal/Stem Cells (MSC) are currently being explored in diverse clinical applications, including regenerative therapies. Their contribution to regeneration of bone fractures is dependent on their capacity to proliferate, undergo osteogenesis and induce angiogenesis. This study aimed to uncover microRNAs capable of concomitantly regulate these mechanisms. Following microRNA array results, we identified miR 195 and miR 497 as downregulated in human primary MSC under osteogenic differentiation. Overexpression of miR 195 or miR 497 in human primary MSC leads to a decrease in osteogenic differentiation and proliferation rate. Conversely, inhibition of miR 195 increased alkaline phosphatase expression and activity and cells proliferation. Then, miR 195 was used to study MSC capacity to recruit blood vessels in vivo. We provide evidence that the paracrine effect of MSC on angiogenesis is diminished when cells over express miR 195. VEGF may partially mediate this effect, as its expression and secreted protein levels are reduced by miR195, while increased by anti miR 195, in human MSC. Luciferase reporter assays revealed a direct interaction between miR 195 and VEGF 3' UTR in bone cancer cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that miR 195 regulates important mechanisms for bone regeneration, specifically MSC osteogenic differentiation, proliferation and control of angiogenesis; therefore, it is a potential target for clinical bone regenerative therapies.

AB The hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche in the bone marrow has been studied extensively over the past few decades, yet the bone marrow microenvironment that supports the growth of metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) has only been recently considered to be a specialized `niche' as well. New evidence supports the fact that disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) of PCa actually target the HSC niche, displace the occupant HSCs and take up residence in the pre existing niche space. This review describes some of the evidence and mechanisms by which DTCs act as molecular parasites of the HSC niche. Furthermore, the interactions between DTCs, HSCs and the niche may provide new targets for niche directed therapy, as well as insight into the perplexing clinical manifestations of metastatic PCa disease.

AB Non invasive treatment approaches are gaining increased attention in recent times due to the potential improvement in treatment efficiency. Here we report a brand new ultrasound (US), magnetic field (MF), and light responsive nanoparticle system based on piezoelectric barium titanate and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles termed as PiezoMagnetic nanoparticles (PMNPs) for the multimodal anticancer treatment, complimentary imaging, and non invasive cell stimulation. Systematic electrical studies reveal that PMNPs exhibit superior ferroelectric and conducting properties and produce electrical signals analogous to native tissues when mechanically stimulated and using Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Low intensity Pulsed Ultrasound (LIPUS) non invasively for cell stimulation. The green energy generation from PMNPs are further proved by the real time demonstration of commercial LED lit up. Thus, as a proof of concept, we have demonstrated a stepwise treatment efficacy of PMNPs for the post surgical osteosarcoma therapy, diagnosis, and regeneration (termed as Theranogeneration). The PMNPs exhibited excellent anticancer properties to eradicate the residual osteosarcoma cells by magnetic hyperthermia, photothermal and photodynamic therapy along with complimentary imaging capabilities as X ray computed tomography contrast agent and label free fluorescent probe. The conjugation of risedronate R (RIS) a new generation bisphosphonates to PMNPs imparted bone seeking property to PMNPs. Therefore, as a result of noninvasive cell stimulation properties of PMNPs under LIPUS and LIPUS mediated RIS release from PMNPs resulted in enhanced bone regeneration and bone turnover which helps to repair the large bone defects occurs in osteosarcoma resection. Thus, the study corroborates the development of a potential bioactive piezoelectric nanoplatform that can be used to control the cell behaviour and fate in order to develop new types of therapies for multiple diseases including various types of cancers in remotely controlled approaches.

AB Bone targeted agents (BTAs) used for the prevention of skeletal related events (SREs) associated with metastatic bone disease possess different attributes that factor into treatment decisions.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate preferences of patients, caregivers, and nurses for features of BTAs used to prevent SREs in patients with a self reported physician diagnosis of bone metastasis from solid tumors.
   Patients (n = 187), primary caregivers (n = 197), or nurses (n = 196) completed a web enabled discrete choice experiment (10 question survey) in which they chose between pairs of hypothetical profiles of BTAs. Each profile was defined by six key treatment attributes, including efficacy and safety (two each) and route/frequency of administration and cost (one each). The relative importance of treatment attributes and levels was estimated.
   The most important treatment attribute for patients and nurses was out of pocket cost, and for caregivers, treatment related risk of renal impairment. Risk of renal impairment was the second most important attribute for patients and nurses, while time until first SRE was the third most important attribute for all respondents. For nurses, risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw was least important, and for patients and caregivers, mode of administration was least important.
   Respondents considered hypothetical medications; therefore, their decisions may not have the same consequences as actual decisions.
   The perspectives of patients, caregivers, and nurses are integral when making treatment decisions about BTAs to prevent SREs associated with solid tumors. Identifying the relative importance of attributes of BTAs will aid in the proper selection of therapy in this setting, which may improve patient outcomes.

AB Prostate cancer (PCa) is known to develop resistance to chemotherapy. Growth arrest specific 6 (GAS6), plays a role in tumor progression by regulating growth in many cancers. Here, we explored how GAS6 regulates the cell cycle and apoptosis of PCa cells in response to chemotherapy. We found that GAS6 is sufficient to significantly increase the fraction of cells in G(1) and the duration of phase in PCa cells. Importantly, the effect of GAS6 on G(1) is potentiated during docetaxel chemotherapy. GAS6 altered the levels of several key cell cycle regulators, including the downregulation of Cyclin B1 (G(2)/M phase), CDC25A, Cyclin E1, and CDK2 (S phase entry), while the upregulation of cell cycle inhibitors p27 and p21, Cyclin D1, and CDK4. Importantly, these changes became further accentuated during docetaxel treatment in the presence of GAS6. Moreover, GAS6 alters the apoptotic response of PCa cells during docetaxel chemotherapy. Docetaxel induced PCa cell apoptosis is efficiently suppressed in PCa cell culture in the presence of GAS6 or GAS6 secreted from co cultured osteoblasts. Similarly, the GAS6 expressing bone environment protects PCa cells from apoptosis within primary tumors in vivo studies. Docetaxel induced significant levels of Caspase 3 and PARP cleavage in PCa cells, while GAS6 protected PCa cells from docetaxel induced apoptotic signaling. Together, these data suggest that GAS6, expressed by osteoblasts in the bone marrow, plays a significant role in the regulation of PCa cell survival during chemotherapy, which will have important implications for targeting metastatic disease.

AB Phosphatidylserine nanocochleates (Nanocochs) are novel delivery systems that may play a prominent osteoprotective role with their cargo, vitamin D3 (Vit D3), against osteoporosis. Therefore, this study was conducted to characterize a Nanococh containing vitamin D3 (Nanococh D3) and investigate its potential role in improving GIO in a rat model. Roll shaped Nanococh D3 particles were obtained in a size range of 320 nm with a sustained release performance. Oral Nanococh D3 significantly increased the bioavailability of Vit D3, enhanced bone mechanical strength, and improved osteogenic biomarkers including B ALP, osteocalcin, Ca, and OPG in GIO rats. This formulation markedly suppressed gene expression of RANK and RANKL in treated rats. Histomorphometric analysis showed significant repairs in bone tissues and TRAP staining indicated a significant decrease in osteoclasts using Nanococh D3 in osteoporotic rats. Nanococh alone similar to Nanococh D3 acted better than AL as a standard anti osteoporotic drug in the improvement of bone strength. In conclusion, our results established the potential role of Nanococh D3 against osteoporosis in rats. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: To determine the effect of dietary soy isoflavone supplementation on bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) rats.
   Methods: Forty eight rats were assigned randomly to groups of OVX rats receiving soy isoflavones (20, 30, or 40 mg/kg of body weight daily), untreated OVX rats, or untreated intact rats. After 8 weeks, bone mineral density (BMD), mineral (Ca, P, Mn, Mg, and Zn) concentrations, and the expression of osteoblast related genes were measured in femur tissue samples.
   Results: Eight weeks after OVX, there was a significant decrease in body weight, serum levels of osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, and oestradiol, BMD and mineral elements, as well as the expressions of Ctnnb1, Runx2, and Sp7 (all p < 0.05). These decreases were accompanied by reduced maximum load capacity of lumbar vertebrae. Daily supplementation with soy isoflavones dose dependently ameliorated these effects (all p < 0.05). Western blotting revealed that these effects were likely due to the reversal of the OVX induced decrease in Notch1 proteins in bone and muscle.
   Conclusion: Soy isoflavone treatment represents a potential therapy for preventing postmenopausal bone loss by stimulating the Notch signalling.

AB Many plant derived substances have estrogenic activities. Due to their ability to bind the estrogen receptor, these compounds have the potential to counteract the deleterious effects of estrogen deficiency on bone. In this study, the effects of apigenin on the function of osteoblastic MC3T3 E1 cells and the production of local factors in osteoblasts were investigated. Apigenin (0.01 mu M) significantly increased the growth of MC3T3 E1 cells and caused a significant elevation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and collagen content in the cells (P < 0.05). The effect of apigenin in increasing ALP activity and collagen content was completely prevented by the presence of 10( 6) M cycloheximide and 10 6 M tamoxifen, suggesting that apigenin's effect results from a newly synthesized protein component and might be partly involved in estrogen action. Locally derived mediators in bone play a crucial role in the regulation of bone remodeling, i.e., bone formation and bone resorption processes. The effect of apigenin on the TNF alpha induced production of IL 6 and nitric oxide (NO) in osteoblasts was examined. Treatment with apigenin (10 mu M) decreased the TNF alpha induced production of IL 6 and NO in osteoblasts. Taken together, these results suggest that apigenin may represent new pharmacological tools for the treatment of osteoporosis.

AB Introduction Osteosarcoma (OSA) is an aggressive form of bone cancer in both dogs and humans. The treatment options for metastatic (stage III) OSA are currently limited and the prognosis is poor. Zoledronate, a second generation amino bisphosphonate, is commonly used for palliation of cancer induced bone pain. Zoledronate has also demonstrated anti cancer properties and possibly enhances the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in a canine histiocytosis cell line and human prostatic cancer cell line. The goal of this study was to evaluate the combination effect of zoledronate and various chemotherapeutic drugs in canine OSA cells.Methods Canine OSA cell line (D17), cells from two canine primary OSAs, and MDCK, a canine kidney cell line, were used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of these drugs. Carboplatin, doxorubicin, vinorelbine, toceranib, and isophosphoramide mustard (active metabolite of ifosfamide) were used as chemotherapeutic agents. First, cells were treated with either zoledronate or chemotherapy drug alone for 72 hours. Cell viability was assessed using CellTiter Glo and IC5, IC10, IC20, and IC50 were calculated. Second, cells were treated with a combination of zoledronate and each chemotherapeutic agent at their IC5, IC10, IC20, and IC50 concentrations. After 72 hours, cell viability was assessed by CellTiter Glo.Results and discussion Zoledronate, carboplatin, doxorubicin, vinorelbine, and isophosphoramide mustard showed concentration dependent decrease in cell viability. Toceranib showed decreased cell viability only at higher concentrations. When zoledronate was used in combination with chemotherapy drugs, while it showed potential synergistic effects with toceranib, potential antagonistic effects with vinorelbine and isophosphoramide mustard were observed. However, the results differed by cell line and thus, further evaluation is warranted to understand the exact mechanism of action.

AB The phosphaturic hormone Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) controls phosphate homeostasis by regulating renal expression of sodium dependent phosphate co transporters and cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in vitamin D catabolism. Multiple FGF Receptors (FGFRs) can act as receptors for FGF23 when bound by the co receptor Klotho expressed in the renal tubular epithelium. FGFRs also regulate skeletal FGF23 secretion; ectopic FGFR activation is implicated in genetic conditions associated with FGF23 overproduction and hypophosphatemia. The identity of FGFRs that mediate the activity of FGF23 or that regulate skeletal FGF23 secretion remains ill defined. Here we report that pharmacological activation of FGFR1 with monoclonal anti FGFR1 antibodies (R1MAb) in adult mice is sufficient to cause an elevation in serum FGF23 and mild hypophosphatemia. In cultured rat calvariae osteoblasts, R1MAb induces FGF23 mRNA expression and FGF23 protein secretion into the culture medium. In a cultured kidney epithelial cell line, R1MAb acts as a functional FGF23 mimetic and activates the FGF23 program. siRNA mediated Fgfr1 knockdown induced the opposite effects. Taken together, our work reveals the central role of FGFR1 in the regulation of FGF23 production and signal transduction, and has implications in the pathogenesis of FGF23 related hypophosphatemic disorders.

TI RNAi Mediated Silencing of Atp6i and Atp6i Haploinsufficiency Prevents
   Both Bone Loss and Inflammation in a Mouse Model of Periodontal Disease

AB Periodontal disease affects about 80% of adults in America, and is characterized by oral bacterial infection induced gingival inflammation, oral bone resorption, and tooth loss. Periodontitis is also associated with other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and heart disease. Although many efforts have been made to develop effective therapies for this disease, none have been very effective and there is still an urgent need for better treatments and preventative strategies. Herein we explored for the first time the possibility that adeno associated virus (AAV) mediated RNAi knockdown could be used to treat periodontal disease with improved efficacy. For this purpose, we used AAV mediated RNAi knockdown of Atp6i/TIRC7 gene expression to target bone resorption and gingival inflammation simultaneously. Mice were infected with the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis W50 (P. gingivalis) in the maxillary periodontium to induce periodontitis. We found that Atp6i depletion impaired extracellular acidification and osteoclast mediated bone resorption. Furthermore, local injection of AAV shRNA Atp6i/TIRC7 into the periodontal tissues in vivo protected mice from P. gingivalis infection stimulated bone resorption by >85% and decreased the T cell number in periodontal tissues. Notably, AAV mediated Atp6i/TIRC7 knockdown also reduced the expression of osteoclast marker genes and inflammation induced cytokine genes. Atp6i(+/ ) mice with haploinsufficiency were similarly protected from P. gingivalis infection stimulated bone loss and gingival inflammation. This suggests that AAV shRNA Atp6i/TIRC7 therapeutic treatment may significantly improve the health of millions who suffer from P. gingivalis mediated periodontal disease.

AB Recent animal studies have demonstrated that undercarboxylated osteocalcin upregulates insulin secretion via osteoblast insulin signaling. However, it remains unclear whether such a pathway exists in humans. This study showed that serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin levels were inversely associated with fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A(1c), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA IR) levels in community dwelling elderly Japanese men.
   Undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) was reported to increase insulin secretion and improve glucose tolerance via osteoblast insulin signaling in animal based studies. Whether this pathway also exists in humans is unknown. We aimed to clarify whether serum ucOC levels are associated with glycemic status and insulin resistance in the general Japanese population.
   We included 2,174 Japanese men (a parts per thousand yen65 years) who were able to walk without aid from others and lived at home in four cities of Nara Prefecture. We excluded participants with a history of diseases or medications that affect bone metabolism, other than type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin A(1c), and HOMA IR levels were determined as outcome measures.
   Of the 1,597 participants included in the analysis, both intact OC (iOC) and ucOC levels showed significant inverse correlations with all outcome measures, even after adjusting for potential confounders. Mean values of outcome measures showed a significant decreasing trend with higher quintiles of iOC or ucOC after adjusting for confounders. This trend remained significant for ucOC quintiles after further adjustment for iOC levels, but was not significant for iOC quintiles after adjusting for ucOC levels. These results were attenuated, but still apparent, after excluding participants receiving drug therapy for T2DM.
   Levels of ucOC, but not iOC, were inversely associated with glycemic index and insulin resistance in a population of Japanese men. These findings will need to be confirmed with longitudinal studies.

AB A recent approach to improve the osseointegration of implants is to utilize local drug administration. The presence of an osteoporosis drug may influence both bone quantity and quality at the bone/implant interface. Despite this, the performance of bone anchoring implants is traditionally evaluated only by quantitative measurements. In the present study, the osteoporosis drug alendronate (ALN) was administrated from mesoporous titania thin films that were coated onto titanium implants. The effect that the drug had on biomineralization was explored both in vitro using simulated body fluid (SBF) and in vivo in a rat tibia model. The SBF study showed that the apatite formation was completely hindered at a high concentration of ALN (0.1 mg/mL). However, when ALN was administrated from the mesoporous coating the surface became completely covered with apatite. Ex vivo characterization of the bone/implant interface using Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that the presence of ALN enhanced the bone mineralization, and that the chemical signature of newly formed bone in the presence of ALN had a higher resemblance to the pre existing mature bone than to the bone formed without drug. Taken together, this study demonstrates the importance of evaluating the quality of the formed bone to better understand the performance of implants. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Background Osteopenia, sarcopenia, and vascular calcification (VC) are prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease and often coexist. In the absence of proven therapies, it is necessary to develop therapeutic or preventive nutrients supplementation for osteopenia, sarcopenia, and VC. The present study investigated the effect of omega 3 fatty acid (FA) and menaquinone 7 (MK 7) on osteopenia, sarcopenia, and VC in adenine and low protein diet induced uremic rats. Methods Thirty two male Sprague Dawley rats were fed diets containing 0.75% adenine and 2.5% protein for three weeks. Rats were randomly divided into four groups that were fed diets containing 2.5% protein for four weeks: adenine control (0.9% saline), omega 3 FA (300 mg/kg/day), MK 7 (50 mu g/kg/day), and omega 3 FA/MK 7. Von Kossa staining for aortic calcification assessment was performed. Osteoclast surface/bone surface ratio (OcS/BS) of bone and muscle fiber were analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) immunohistochemical staining was done in the aorta and bone. Molecules related with sarcopenia were analyzed using western blotting. Results Compared to the normal control, OcS/BS and aortic calcification, and OPG staining in the aorta and bone were significantly increased in the adenine controls. OPG staining and aortic calcification progressed the least in the group supplemented with both omega 3 FA/MK 7. In the adenine controls, the regular arrangement of muscle fiber was severely disrupted, and inflammatory cell infiltration was more prominent. These findings were reduced after combined supplementation with omega 3 FA/MK 7. Furthermore, decreased mammalian target of rapamycin and increased Forkhead box protein 1 expression was significantly restored by combined supplementation. Conclusions Combined nutrients supplementation with omega 3 FA and MK 7 may be helpful for aortic VC prevention, reducing osteoclast activation and improving sarcopenia related molecules in adenine and low protein diet induced uremic rats.

AB Introduction: We designed OP3 4 (YCEIEFCYLIR), a cyclic peptide, to mimic the soluble osteoprotegerin (OPG), and was proven to bind to RANKL (receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand), thereby inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. We recently found that another RANKL binding peptide, W9, could accelerate bone formation by affecting RANKL signaling in osteoblasts. We herein demonstrate the effects of OP3 4 on bone formation and bone loss in a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis.
   Methods: Twenty four seven week old male DBA/1J mice were used to generate a murine model of collagen induced arthritis (CIA). Then, vehicle or OP3 4 (9 mg/kg/day or 18 mg/kg/day) was subcutaneously infused using infusion pumps for three weeks beginning seven days after the second immunization. The arthritis score was assessed, and the mice were sacrificed on day 49. Thereafter, radiographic, histological and biochemical analyses were performed.
   Results: The OP3 4 treatment did not significantly inhibit the CIA induced arthritis, but limited bone loss. Micro CT images and quantitative measurements of the bone mineral density revealed that 18 mg/kg/day OP3 4 prevented the CIA induced bone loss at both articular and periarticular sites of tibiae. As expected, OP3 4 significantly reduced the CIA induced serum CTX levels, a marker of bone resorption. Interestingly, the bone histomorphometric analyses using undecalcified sections showed that OP3 4 prevented the CIA induced reduction of bone formation related parameters at the periarticular sites.
   Conclusion: The peptide that mimicked OPG prevented inflammatory bone loss by inhibiting bone resorption and stimulating bone formation. It could therefore be a useful template for the development of small molecule drugs for inflammatory bone loss.

AB BackgroundAccurate documentation of a patient's prior medication use and awareness of side effects associated with anti osteoporotic agents can assist dentists to prevent medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw. I aimed to determine the awareness of Korean dentists regarding medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw and the duration of drug holidays they prescribe to patients who need to undergo various dental procedures.MethodsAn online, questionnaire based survey was conducted among 1000 dentists registered in an online community in Korea. The following were determined: general characteristics; type of practice; recordkeeping regarding patients' use of bone modifying agents; requirement of a doctor's referral letter; advice given regarding drug holidays of bone modifying agents before dental surgery procedures; and experience with medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw. Differences between dentists with and without experience in treating patients with medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw were evaluated using the chi (2) test.ResultsAlthough a relatively high proportion (293/1000, 29.3%) of dentists had experienced cases of medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw, only 650/1000 (65.0%) routinely documented the type of bone modifying agent used by patients and the duration of its use. Moreover, only 591/1000 (59.1%) dentists routinely requested referral letters from doctors before performing dental surgery on patients. Although the recommended period for a drug holiday differs for each drug, 533/1000 (53.3%) dentists did not make such a distinction. There was a statistically significant difference in the level of detail documented in terms of anti osteoporotic drug use between dentists who had no experience in medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw (707/1000) and those who had such experience (P=0.007). There was a statistically significant difference in the length of drug holidays prescribed between dentists with and without prior experience with the condition (P=0.001).ConclusionsThese results suggest that dentists do not respond consistently to patients' drug history prior to performing dental procedures. This implies the need for increased cooperation between dentists and physicians, as well as the development of targeted educational interventions for the dental profession, to reduce the risk of medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw.Trial registrationNot applicable.

AB Osteosarcoma (OS) metastasis and recurrence and multidrug resistance are three major obstacles in the clinic. New highly effective and low toxicity drugs for osteosarcoma are needed. The antitumoral efficacy of cetrimonium bromide (CTAB), a quaternary ammonium compound, is gradually being investigated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of CTAB on OS cells and the underlying mechanisms. CTAB inhibited the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells in a concentration  and time dependent manner, resulting in cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. CTAB also suppressed the migration and invasion of HOS and MG63 cells at a low concentration without inhibiting the growth of human osteoblasts. Moreover, CTAB promoted caspase mediated apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells through the PI3K/AKT cascade, and this effect was accompanied by obvious mitochondrial toxicity. In vivo, CTAB inhibited OS proliferation without inducing organ toxicity. In conclusion, this study reveals that CTAB has an inhibitory effect on OS by suppressing proliferation and metastasis and inducing apoptosis through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and identifies CTAB as a potential therapeutic drug.

AB Parathyroid hormone (PTH) plays a critical role in calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Interestingly, in two forms of hyperparathyroidism (excessive amount of PTH in the serum), the metabolic disturbances in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) significantly differ from those with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP). Since an intuitive understanding of these PTH linked regulatory mechanisms are hardly possible, we developed a mathematical model using clinical data (1586 CKD and 40 PHP patients). The model was composed of a set of ordinary differential equations, in which the regulatory mechanism of PTH together with other key factors such as 1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D) and calcium was described in the tissues including bone, the kidney, the serum, and the parathyroid glands. In this model, an increase in PTH was induced by its autonomous production in PHP, while PTH in CKD was elevated by a decrease in feedback inhibition of 1,25(OH) 2D in the serum, as well as an increase in stimulation by phosphorus in the serum. The model based analysis revealed characteristic differences in the outcomes of hyperparathyroidism in CKD and PHP. The calcium exchange in bone, for instance, was predicted significantly higher in PHP than CKD. Furthermore, we evaluated the observed and predicted responses to the administration of calcimimetics, a recently developed synthetic drug that modulated efficacy of calcium sensing receptors. The results herein support the notion that the described model would enable us to pose testable hypotheses about the actions of PTH, providing a quantitative analytical tool for evaluating treatment strategies of PHP and CKD.

AB It is well known that patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus exhibit bone abnormalities as one of the complications of the disease. Whether this occurs in type 2 diabetes is controversial. This uncertainty could be because type 2 diabetes includes several pathological types such as obese and non obese. To examine the bone abnormalities in non obese type 2 diabetes, we used Spontaneously Diabetic Torii (SDT) rats, which is a newly established model of non obese type 2 diabetes. Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were used as a control group (n=17). SDT rats were divided into two groups: the diabetic (DM) group (n=18) and the DM+insulin (INS) group (n=18) at 20 weeks of age. The DM+INS group received subcutaneously implanted insulin pellets every 2 weeks. At 36 weeks of age, the rats were killed, and we evaluated bone formation and the effect of insulin on bone formation, blood and urine analyses, bone mineral density (BMD), histomorphometry, and mRNA expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OCN). Despite renal function not being impaired, BMD and bone. strength were significantly lower in the DM group than in the control group. Osteoid volume per bone volume, osteoblast surface per bone surface, eroded surface per bone surface, osteoclast surface per bone surface, the mineral apposition rate, and the bone formation rate per bone surface were significantly lower in the DM group than in the control and DM+INS groups. The mRNA expression of ALP and OCN was significantly lower in the DM group than in the control group. Furthermore, 8 hydroxydeoxyguanosine, which is an oxidative stress marker, was remarkably elevated in the DM group. These abnormalities were recovered by insulin therapy.
   Our data support the notion that non obese type 2 diabetes is associated with a low turnover of bone and that the abnormalities are ameliorated by insulin. The SDT rat may be a useful animal model for examining the mechanisms of bone abnormalities in non obese type 2 diabetes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: To investigate the effects of bezafibrate on the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblastic MC3T3 E1 cells, and to determine the signaling pathway underlying the effects.
   Methods: MC3T3 E1 cells, a mouse osteoblastic cell line, were used. Cell viability and proliferation were examined using MTT assay and colorimetric BrdU incorporation assay, respectively. NO production was evaluated using the Griess reagent. The mRNA expression of ALP, collagen I, osteocalcin, BMP 2, and Runx 2 was measured using real time PCR. Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of AMPK and eNOS proteins.
   Results: Bezafibrate increased the viability and proliferation of MC3T3 E1 cells in a dose and time dependent manner. Bezafibrate (100 mu mol/L) significantly enhanced osteoblastic mineralization and expression of the differentiation markers ALP, collagen I and osteocalcin. Bezafibrate (100 mu mol/L) increased phosphorylation of AMPK and eNOS, which led to an increase of NO production by 4.08 fold, and upregulating BMP 2 and Runx 2 mRNA expression. These effects could be blocked by AMPK inhibitor compound C (5 mu mol/L), or the PPAR beta inhibitor GSK0660 (0.5 mu mol/L), but not by the PPAR alpha inhibitor MK886 (10 mu mol/L). Furthermore, GSK0660, compound C, or N G nitro L arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L NAME, 1 mmol/L) could reverse the stimulatory effects of bezafibrate (100 mu mol/L) on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, whereas MK886 only inhibited bezafibrate induced osteoblast proliferation.
   Conclusion: Bezafibrate stimulates proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3 E1 cells, mainly via a PPAR beta dependent mechanism. The drug might be beneficial for osteoporosis by promoting bone formation.

TI Erdheim Chester's disease of the heart:: A diagnostic conundrum and
   collision with the same mass in the orbit
SO HEART SURGERY FORUM
LA English
DT Article
AB Erdheim Chester's disease is a rare multisystem xanthogranulomatosis, afflicting the skeletal system with the occasional involvement of soft tissues. We delineate an unusual case of a cardiac variant of Erdheim Chester's disease presenting with pericardial effusion and as a collision with a synchronous orbital manifestation. We describe our diagnostic pathway and propose a novel treatment option involving nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs. The role of cyclo oxygenase in the disease process and inhibition thereof by NSAIDs is hypothesized and discussed.

AB Per operative infection is a common complication for bone graft surgery. Combining antiseptic agents with graft materials may offer a solution by increasing local drug concentration at target sites. Aiming to achieve a sustained local antibiotic (ATB) delivery for a widely applied bone substitute material hydroxyapatite (HA), we attempted incorporating hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin polymer (polyHP beta CD) into microporous HA via impregnating either in a CD monomers mixture solution or a pre synthesized CD polymer solution, followed by thermal fixation processing. In such functionalised material (CD HA), polyHP beta CD could entrap ATBs and release them progressively. Infrared spectroscopic analysis confirmed the presence of polyHP beta CD in functionalised HA via both processing pathways; polyHP beta CD functionalisation yields were quantitated by thermogravimetric analysis for optimising the processing regime. Ciprofloxacin (CFX) and vancomycin (VCM), commonly applied in orthopaedics, have been respectively loaded on CD HA by dip coating. For both ATBs, kinetic release test in phosphate buffered saline showed significantly increased initial burst amount and prolonged release from CD HA compared with those from non functionalised HA. Encouragingly, ATBs loaded CD HA also revealed a prolonged bacteriostatic activity against Staphylococcus aureus and progressively increased cytocompatibility to osteoblasts (MC3T 3 E1). Overall, polyHP beta CD functionalisation on HA could be an effective drug delivery model for loading different drug molecules in prevention of infection. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Glucocorticoid induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (GIONFH) is a common bone and joint disease. There is currently a lack of effective treatment for GIONFH, and the disease progression may lead to total hip arthroplasty (THA). The exact mechanism of GIONFH pathogenesis remains unsettled, and emerging evidence indicates that the overactivation of osteoclasts plays a pivotal role in the occurrence and progression of this condition. Our previous study has shown that cycloastragenol (CAG), a triterpenoid saponin with multiple bioactivities, is a natural osteoclast inhibitor and has a protective effect on bone loss. However, its effect on GIONFH remains unclear. Methods: In this study, methylprednisolone (MPS) (20 mg/kg) was administered via gluteal muscle injection to female Sprague  Dawley (SD) rats to induce GIONFH, and different doses of CAG (5 and 15 mg/kg) were dispensed intraperitoneally for intervention. Micro  CT screening and angiography were applied to determine the shaping of necrotic lesions, the loss of trabecular bone, and the change in the local blood supply. The molecular mechanism was established by Real time qPCR and Western blotting. Hematoxylin and eosin (H &E) staining was performed to identify empty lacunae in the femoral head. Results: CAG treatment shanked the necrotic lesion area, inhibited the trabecular bone loss, and improved the local blood supply in the femoral head. In addition, CAG medication lowered the ratio of Tnfsf11 (encoding RANKL) to Tnfrsf11b (encoding OPG) and the expression of osteoclast specific genes, including Acp5 and Ctsk. Consistently, CAG treatment exhibited a dose  dependent weakening effect on the expression of osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption  related proteins, including TRAP, CTSK, and MMP9. CAG addition also alleviated the occurrence of empty lacunae in the subchondral region. Conclusion: Our discoveries demonstrate that CAG is a potential option for hip preservation therapy in GIONFH patients. Translational potential of this article: The protective effect of CAG on rats with GIONFH can be translated into clinical use.

TI Abnormal Decrease of Macrophage ALKBH5 Expression Causes Abnormal
   Polarization and Inhibits Osteoblast Differentiation
SO STEM CELLS INTERNATIONAL

DT Article
ID MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS; THERAPY; RISK
AB Peri implant tissue inflammation is an inflammatory injury that occurs in the soft and hard tissues surrounding the implant and is the main cause of short  or long term failure of implant prosthetic restorations, which is compounded by bone loss and bone destruction in the alveolar bone of diabetes patients with peri implantitis. However, the mechanisms underlying the persistence of diabetic peri implantitis, as well as the essential connections and key molecules that regulate its start and progression, remain unknown. In this study, we discovered that M1 macrophage polarization was abnormally enhanced in diabetic peri implantitis and influenced the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. RNA sequencing revealed that ALKBH5 expression was abnormally reduced in diabetic peri implantitis. Further mechanism study showed that ALKBH5 and its mediated m(6)A can influence osteogenic differentiation, which in turn influences the persistence of diabetic peri implantitis. Our findings present a new mechanism for the suppression of osteoblast development in diabetic peri implantitis and a new treatment strategy to promote anabolism by inhibiting ALKBH5.

AB We have synthesized a flavonoid metal complex (FMC) by chelating zinc to epigallocatechin 3 gallate (EGCG), a flavonoid present in green tea and incorporated into chitosan (CS) to form 3D constructs by freeze drying method. Scanning electron microscopy characterized The scaffolds for surface morphology and pore dimensions and depicted the presence of interconnected porous network. The scaffolds exhibited optimal pore size (>50 mu m), facilitating bone tissue ingrowth and neovascularization. Inclusion of Zn EGCG into CS matrix improved the mechanical property by increasing compressive strength (0.53 +/  0.045 MPa) and reducing enzymatic degradation with controlled swelling. In addition, increased protein adsorption was observed during the initial hour, which is crucial for cell attachment. Furthermore, the FMC inclusion promoted exogenous biomineralization of CS scaffolds as early as 4d in simulated body fluid. Indirect cytotoxicity measurements indicated the scaffolds with ZnEGCG had no toxic effects on mouse mesenchymal stem cells (mMSCs). Under osteogenic environment, the scaffold promoted calcium deposition of mMSCs by upregulation of ALP activity and increased expression of osteoblast differentiation markers such as Runx2, Col I, OC and OPN. We found that the involvement of miR15b/smurf 1 signalling pathway behind the osteogenic potential of the scaffold. In vivo assessments using the chick embryo CAM assay showed enhanced angiogenesis and confirmed the scaffold's biocompatibility with no toxicity. Additionally, in a zebrafish scale regeneration model, the scaffold enhanced calcium deposition and osteoblast marker expression, aligning with the in vitro findings. Overall, form the study it is clear that the osteogenic potential of the scaffold is as follows chitosan < EGCG Chitosan < Zn EGCG Chitosan.

AB Objectives
   To clarify which rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients benefit most from the anti receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand antibody denosumab to reduce the progression of joint destruction.
   Methods
   We pooled patient data from the 12 month, double blind, placebo controlled DRIVE (phase II) and DESIRABLE (phase III) studies. In DRIVE, concomitant treatment was limited to methotrexate, salazosulfapyridine and bucillamine. In DESIRABLE, patients could receive any disease modifying antirheumatic drug. RA patients were randomised to denosumab 60 mg every 6 months (Q6M), every 3 months (Q3M) or placebo. Efficacy was assessed by van der Heijde modified total Sharp score (mTSS), bone erosion score (ES) and joint space narrowing score (JSNS). Change in mTSS was assessed in subgroups stratified by risk factors for radiographic damage if the interaction factor was significant.
   Results
   The pooled analysis included 909 patients. Denosumab reduced worsening of mTSS (mean (SD)) at 12 months in the Q6M (0.88 (3.30), p=0.0024) and Q3M (0.66 (2.16), p=0.0002) groups versus placebo (1.50 (3.73)). This reduction in mTSS progression was due to the change in ES (Q6M, 0.44 (1.89), p=0.0006; Q3M, 0.20 (0.86), p<0.0001) versus placebo (0.98 (2.54)); no effect was observed on JSNS. Anti cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies, glucocorticoid use and baseline ES showed a significant interaction. Denosumab was particularly effective in patients who were anti CCP antibody positive (p<0.05). Changes in mTSS versus placebo were observed in all denosumab dose groups, regardless of glucocorticoid use and baseline ES.
   Conclusions
   Denosumab broadly reduced the progression of joint destruction in RA patients with risk factors for radiographic damage such as especially anti CCP antibody positivity.

AB The hallmark of multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma cell infiltration in the bone marrow accompanied by myelosuppression and osteolysis. Premalignant stages such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and asymptomatic stages such as smoldering myeloma (SMM) can progress to MM. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are an integral component of the bone marrow microenvironment and play an important role in osteoblast differentiation and hematopoietic support. Although stromal alterations have been reported in MM contributing to hematopoietic insufficiency and osteolysis, it is not clear whether alterations in MSC already occur in MGUS or SMM. In this study, we analyzed MSCs from MGUS, SMM, and MM regarding their properties and functionality and performed messenger RNA sequencing to find underlying molecular signatures in different disease stages. A high number of senescent cells and a reduced osteogenic differentiation capacity and hematopoietic support were already present in MGUS MSC. As shown by RNA sequencing, there was a broad spectrum of differentially expressed genes including genes of the BMP/TGF signaling pathway, detected already in MGUS and that clearly increases in patients with SMM and MM. Our data may help to block these signaling pathways in the future to hinder progression to MM.

AB Biodegradable polymer coatings on magnesium alloys are attractive, as they can provide corrosion resistance as well as additional functions for biomedical applications, e.g., drug delivery. A gelatin nanospheres/chitosan (GNs/CTS) composite coating on WE43 substrate was fabricated by electrophoretic deposition with simvastatin (SIM) loaded into the GNs. Apart from a sustained drug release over 28 days, an anticorrosion behavior of the coated WE43 substrates was confirmed by electrochemical tests. Both the degradation and corrosion rates of the coated substrate were significantly minimized in contrast to bare WE43. The cytocompatibility of the coated samples was analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally, the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3El cells on SIM containing coatings was assessed by measuring the expression of osteogenic genes and related proteins, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and extracellular matrix mineralization, showing that the SIM loaded composite coating could upregulate the expression of osteogenic genes and related proteins, promote ALP activity, and enhance extracellular matrix mineralization. In summary, the SIM loaded GNs/CTS composite coatings were able to enhance the corrosion resistance of the WE43 substrate and promote osteogenic activity, thus demonstrating a promising coating system for modifying the surface of magnesium alloys targeted for orthopedic applications.

AB Amentoflavone is a bioflavonoid found in a variety of traditional Chinese medicines such as Gingko and Selaginella tamariscina. It has been reported that amentoflavone has anti inflammatory, antioxidant, antiviral and anticancer effects. However, the effect of amentoflavone on osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) has not been studied. In this study, we aim to explore the effect of amentoflavone on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. The results showed that amentoflavone significantly enhanced the proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization in hMSCs. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of runt related transcription factor 2 and osterix proteins was upregulated in amentoflavone treated hMSCs. Furthermore, we investigated the possible signaling pathways responsible for osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs by amentoflavone. We found that amentoflavone significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated JNK and p p38. The amentoflavone induced increases of ALP and mineralization were significantly diminished when the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways were blocked by selected inhibitors (SP600125, SB203580) in hMSCs. Furthermore, in vivo evidence indicated that amentoflavone protected against the dexamethasone induced inhibition of osteoblast differentiation in tg(sp7:egfp) zebrafish larvae. Thus, we showed for the first time that amentoflavone improves the osteogenesis of hMSCs through the JNK and p38 MAPK pathway. Amentoflavone may be beneficial in treating bone related disorders.

AB The treatment for oral cancer usually involves surgical excision followed by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. The combination of these therapies generally promotes a serious inflammation of the mucosa of the digestive tract, denominated mucositis, which compromises continuity of treatment. Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy has been used successfully to reduce the oral mucositis, however there is still some controversy regarding the effects of this therapy on unintentionally irradiated tumor cells that may remain after cancer treatment. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of PBM therapy (using parameters for mucositis) on the modulation of osteoclastogenic potential of a cell line derived from human lingual squamous cell carcinoma (SCC9). Previously irradiated SCC9 cells were co cultured with human osteoclast precursors. Cocultures performed with non irradiated SCC9 cells served as control. After 7, 14 and 21 days the co cultures were evaluated for the tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity, an osteoclastogenic marker. Additionally, the monocultures of SCC9 cells (non irradiated and irradiated) were analyzed for cell viability/proliferation and for the expression of IL 11 and PTHrP. The irradiation of SCC9 cells with PBM with an energy density of 4 J/cm(2) decreased the pro osteoclastogenic potential of those cells. This may represent a potential useful side effect of PBM therapy.

AB Purpose: Despite recent improvements in therapeutic management of osteosarcoma, ongoing challenges in improving the response to chemotherapy warrants the development of new strategies to improve overall patient survival. Among them, HSP90 is a molecular chaperone involved in the maturation and stability of various oncogenic proteins leading to tumor cells survival and disease progression. We assessed the antitumor properties of a synthetic HSP90 inhibitor, PF4942847, alone or in combination with zoledronic acid in osteosarcoma.
   Experimental Design: The effects of PF4942847 were evaluated on human osteosarcoma cells growth and apoptosis. Signaling pathways were analyzed by Western blotting. The consequence of HSP90 therapy combined or notwith zoledronic acid was evaluated in mice bearing HOS MNNG xenografts on tumor growth, associated bone lesions, and pulmonary metastasis. The effect of PF4942847 on osteoclastogenesis was assessed on human CD14(+) monocytes.
   Results: In osteosarcoma cell lines, PF4942847 inhibited cell growth in a dose dependent manner (IC50 +/  50 nmol/L) and induced apoptosis with an increase of sub G(1) fraction and cleaved PARP. These biologic events were accompanied by decreased expression of Akt, p ERK, c Met, and c RAF1. When administered orally to mice bearing osteosarcoma tumors, PF4942847 significantly inhibited tumor growth by 80%, prolonged survival compared with controls, and inhibited pulmonary metastases by blocking c Met, FAK, and MMP9 signaling. In contrast to 17 allylamino 17 demethoxygeldanamycin (17 AAG), PF4942847 did not induce osteoclast differentiation, and synergistically acted with zoledronic acid to delay osteosarcoma progression and prevent bone lesions.
   Conclusions: All these data provide a strong rationale for clinical evaluation of PF4942847 alone or in combination with zoledronic acid in osteosarcoma. (C) 2015 AACR.

AB Supplemental Digital Content is Available in the Text.Opioid analgesics can off target activate the toll like receptor 4. In models of metastatic cancer to the bone, this activation leads to enhanced osteolysis and hyperalgesia.
   The propensity for breast cancer to metastasize to bone is coupled to the most common complaint among breast cancer patients: bone pain. Classically, this type of pain is treated using escalating doses of opioids, which lack long term efficacy due to analgesic tolerance, opioid induced hypersensitivity, and have recently been linked to enhanced bone loss. To date, the molecular mechanisms underlying these adverse effects have not been fully explored. Using an immunocompetent murine model of metastatic breast cancer, we demonstrated that sustained morphine infusion induced a significant increase in osteolysis and hypersensitivity within the ipsilateral femur through the activation of toll like receptor 4 (TLR4). Pharmacological blockade with TAK242 (resatorvid) as well as the use of a TLR4 genetic knockout ameliorated the chronic morphine induced osteolysis and hypersensitivity. Genetic MOR knockout did not mitigate chronic morphine hypersensitivity or bone loss. In vitro studies using RAW264.7 murine macrophages precursor cells demonstrated morphine enhanced osteoclastogenesis that was inhibited by the TLR4 antagonist. Together, these data indicate that morphine induces osteolysis and hypersensitivity that are mediated, in part, through a TLR4 receptor mechanism.

AB Glucocorticoid (GC) therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for many conditions of childhood and an important cause of skeletal and endocrine morbidity. Here, we discuss cases that bring to life the most important concepts in the management of pediatric GC induced osteoporosis (pGIO). Given the wide variety of underlying conditions linked to pGIO, we focus on the fundamental clinical biological principles that provide a blueprint for management in any clinical context. In so doing, we underscore the importance of longitudinal vertebral fracture phenotyping, how knowledge about the timing and risk of fractures influences monitoring, the role of bone mineral density in pGIO assessments, and the impact of growth mediated "vertebral body reshaping" after spine fractures on the therapeutic approach. Overall, pGIO management is predicated upon early identification of fractures (including vertebral) in those at risk, and timely intervention when there is limited potential for spontaneous recovery. Even a single, low trauma long bone or vertebral fracture can signal an osteoporotic event in an at risk child. The most widely used treatments for pediatric osteoporosis, intravenous bisphosphonates, are currently recommended first line for the treatment of pGIO. It is recognized, however, that even early identification of bone fragility, combined with timely introduction of the most potent bisphosphonate therapies, may not completely prevent osteoporosis progression in all contexts. Therefore, prevention of first ever fractures in the highest risk settings is on the horizon, where there is also a need to move beyond antiresorptives to the study of anabolic agents.

AB Bisphosphonates are commonly used to treat malignant tumours that originate in bone. In recent years, with the widespread application of these drugs in chemotherapy, reports have raised concerns about the development of osteonecrosis. Though the mechanism of bisphosphonate related osteonecrosis of the jaw is not clear, vascular injury resulting from their use has been suggested as a possible cause. This study was designed to explore the influence of zoledronic acid, one of the most common bisphosphonates, on the function and viability of vascular endothelial cells in vitro to try to find possible mechanisms of the action bisphosphonates in osteonecrosis. Endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis were examined with MTT assays, scratch tests, and flow cytometry in the presence of zoledronic acid in different concentrations. The relative expressions of protein were also examined by western blot assays, and the significance of the differences among concentrations of the drug were assessed statistically. Concentrations zoledronic acid of 15 mu mol 150 mu mol, can dose dependently inhibit the activity of vascular endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and significantly up regulate cell apoptosis (p < 0.05). Zoledronic acid can inhibit the vascular endothelial cell activities of proliferation and migration, and can up regulate cellular apoptosis, which suggests that direct inhibition of angiogenesis together with vascular impairment might contribute to the development of osteonecrosis of the jaw.

AB Background Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D) and Osteoarthritis (OA) are both prevalent diseases that significantly impact the health of patients. Increasing evidence suggests that there is a big correlation between T2D and OA, but the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. The aims of this study are to investigate the shared biomarkers and potential molecular mechanisms in T2D combined with OA.Methods T2D and OA related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified via bioinformatic analysis on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets GSE26168 and GSE114007 respectively. Subsequently, extensive target prediction and network analysis were finished with Gene Ontology (GO), protein protein interaction (PPI), and pathway enrichment with DEGs. The transcription factors (TFs) and miRNAs coupled in co expressed DEGs involved in T2D and OA were predicted as well. The key genes expressed both in the clinical tissues of T2D and OA were detected with western blot and qRT PCR assay. Finally, the most promising candidate compounds were predicted with the Drug Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb) and molecular docking.Results In this study, 209 shared DEGs between T2D and OA were identified. Functional analysis disclosed that these DEGs are predominantly related to ossification, regulation of leukocyte migration, extracellular matrix (ECM) structural constituents, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt signaling pathways. Further analysis via Protein Protein Interaction (PPI) analysis and validation with external datasets emphasized MMP9 and ANGPTL4 as crucial genes in both T2D and OA. Our findings were validated through qRT PCR and Western blot analyses, which indicated high expression levels of these pivotal genes in T2D, OA, and T2D combined with OA cases. Additionally, the analysis of Transcription Factors (TFs) miRNA interactions identified 7 TFs and one miRNA that jointly regulate these important genes. The Receiver Operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated the significant diagnostic potential of MMP9 and ANGPTL4.Moreover, we identified raloxifene, ezetimibe, and S 3304 as promising agents for patients with both T2D and OA.Conclusion This study uncovers the shared signaling pathways, biomarkers, potential therapeutics, and diagnostic models for individuals suffering from both T2D and OA. These findings not only present novel perspectives on the complex interplay between T2D and OA but also hold significant promise for improving the clinical management and prognosis of patients with this concurrent condition.

AB Objective: To investigate the effect of simvastatin loaded polymer nanoparticles on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, and to seek a better pharmaceutical dosage form to improve the osteogenic effect of simvastatin and provide a more practical drug carrier for its clinical application.Methods: polymer nanoparticles were prepared via the modified spontaneous emulsifying solvent diffusion (SESD) method, and the effects of simvastatin loaded methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) polylactic acid nano  particles on osteoblasts were investigated. A 3 (4,5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl) 5 (3 carboxymethoxyphenyl) 2 (4 sulfophenyl) 2H tetrazolium (MTS) assay was adopted to detect the proliferation abilities of the cells. An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the amount of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the cells. A real time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression of osteocalcin (OC) and bone morpho genetic protein 2 (BMP 2) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA).Results: The study found that the proliferation of osteocytes was inhibited in the simvastatin loaded nanoparticle (Sim NP) group, and this inhibition was stronger in the Sim NP than in the simvastatin group; the ALP activity of osteoblasts was increased in both groups, and this increase was stronger in the Sim NP than in the simvastatin group. The expression of ALP, OC and BMP 2 mRNA was increased in both groups, and this increase was stronger in the Sim NP than in the simvastatin group.Conclusion: The authors thus posited that the modified Sim NPs SESD preparation method was simple and reproducible, and the prepared nanoparticles, with uniform distribution, a regular morphology and spherical shape could greatly improve the solubility of simvastatin. The polymer nanoparticle carrier system improved the effect of simvastatin on the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts so that the Sim NPs were systemati cally applied to target bone tissues. These results provide a new direction for research on the drugs and treatment methods for osteoporosis.

AB Background: Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance requires a specific microenvironment. HSC niches can be activated by tissue damaging chemotherapeutic drugs and various cell signaling molecules such as SDF 1 and FGF, which might also result in bone marrow stress. Recent research has insufficiently shown that endosteal osteolineage cells and other niche constituents recover after marrow injury.
   Methods: We investigated the role of FGF2 in the osteoblastic niche cells during hematopoietic homeostasis recovery after bone marrow injury. Mice were treated with 5 fluorouracil (5FU) to eliminate actively cycling cells in the bone marrow. Primary osteoblasts were isolated and subjected to cell culture. Real time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemical staining were performed to study niche related genes, osteoblast markers, and FGF2 signaling. Proliferation rate were analyzed by marker gene Ki67 and colony formation assay. Also, osterix positive osteoprogenitor cells were isolated by FACS from Osx GFP Cre mice after 5FU treatment, and subjected to RNA sequencing and analyzed for Fgf receptors and niche markers.
   Results: The endosteal osteolineage cells isolated from 5FU treated mice showed increased expression of the niche related genes Sdf 1, Jagged 1, Scf, N cad, Angpt1 and Vcam 1 and the osteoblast marker genes Osx, Opn, Runx2, and Alp, indicating that BM stress upon 5FU treatment activated the osteoblastic niche. Endosteal osteoblast expanded from a single layer to several layers 3 and 6 days after 5FU treatment. During the early recovery phase in 5FU activated osteoblastic niches increased FGF2 expression and activated its downstream pERK. FGF2 treatment resulted in increased proliferation rate and the expression of niche marker genes in 5FU activated osteoblastic niche cells. RNA seq analysis in Osterix positive osteoprogenitor cells isolated from 5FU treated Osx GFP mice showed significantly increased expression of Fgf receptors Fgfr1, 2 and 3. Although osteoblastic niche cells were damaged by 5FU treatment in the beginning, the increased number of OB layers in the recovery phase may be derived from resident osteoprogenitor cells by FGF2 activation under stress.
   Conclusions: Taken together, FGF2 signaling can regulate osteoblastic niche cells to support HSC homeostasis in response to bone marrow damage.

AB Human amnion mesenchymal stem cells (HAMSCs) can be obtained from human amniotic membrane, a highly abundant and readily available tissue. HAMSC sources present fewer ethical issues, have low immunogenicity, anti inflammatory properties, considerable advantageous characteristics, and are considered an attractive potential treatment material in the field of regenerative medicine. We used a co culture system to determine whether HAMSCs could promote osteogenesis in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (HBMSCs). We isolated HAMSCs from discarded amnion samples and collected them using pancreatin/collagenase digestion. We cultured HAMSCs and HBMSCSs in basal medium. Activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), an early osteogenesis marker, was increased in the co culture system compared to the control single cultures, which we also confirmed by ALP staining. We used immunofluorescence testing to investigate the effects of co culturing with HAMSCs on HBMSC proliferation, which revealed that the co culturing enhanced EdU expression in HBMSCs. Western blotting and quantitative real time PCR indicated that co culturing promoted osteogenesis in HBMSCs. Furthermore, Alizarin red S staining revealed that extracellular matrix calcium levels in mineralized nodule formation produced by the co cultures were higher than that in the controls. Using the same co culture system, we further observed the effects of HAMSCs on osteogenic differentiation in primary osteoblasts by Western blotting, which better addressed the mechanism for HAMSCs in bone regeneration. The results showed HAMSCs are osteogenic and not only play a role in promoting HBMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation but also in osteoblasts, laying the foundation for new regenerative medicine methods.

AB Small molecule compounds strongly affecting osteogenesis can form the basis of effective therapeutic strategies in bone regenerative medicine. A cell based high throughput screening system might be a powerful tool for identifying osteoblast targeting candidates; however, this approach is generally limited with using only one molecule as a cell based sensor that does not always reflect the activation of the osteogenic phenotype. In the present study, we used the MC3T3 E1 cell line stably transfected with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene driven by a fragment of type I collagen promoter (Col 1a1GFP MC3T3 E1) to evaluate a double screening system to identify osteogenic inducible compounds using a combination of a cell based reporter assay and detection of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Col 1a1GFP MC3T3 E1 cells were cultured in an osteogenic induction medium after library screening of 1280 pharmacologically active compounds (Lopack(1280)). After 7 days, GFP fluorescence was measured using a microplate reader. After 14 days of osteogenic induction, the cells were stained with ALP. Library screening using the Col 1a1/GFP reporter and ALP staining assay detected three candidates with significant osteogenic induction ability. Furthermore, leflunomide, one of the three detected candidates, significantly promoted new bone formation in vivo. Therefore, this double screening method could identify candidates for osteogenesis targeting compounds more reliably than conventional methods.

TI Metformin Facilitates Osteoblastic Differentiation and M2 Macrophage
   Polarization by PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway in Human Umbilical Cord

AB Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the most promising multipotent stem cells that can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. This cellular flexibility contributes to widespread clinical use of MSCs in tissue repair and regeneration. The immune system is a key player in regulating bone remodeling. In recent years, the association between the immune system and bone metabolism has become an increasing focus of interest. Metformin, a glucose lowering drug, exerts powerful impact on metabolic signaling. However, whether metformin can modulate bone metabolism or whether metformin can influence immune milieu by regulation of macrophages has not been thoroughly elucidated. Herein, we specifically explored the complex interactions between macrophages and human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC MSCs) in the context of metformin. Our research demonstrated that metformin not only stimulated osteogenesis of UC MSCs but also influenced the immune system via promoting M2 but reducing M1 macrophages. Mechanically, we found that metformin treated M2 macrophages possessed more potent osteoinductive capacity in our coculture system. Molecularly, these metformin stimulated M2 macrophages facilitated osteogenesis via activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. As demonstrated by using PI3K specific inhibitor LY294002, we found that the pathway inhibitor partly reversed osteoinductive activity which was activated by coculture of metformin treated M2 macrophages. Overall, our novel research illuminated the cooperative and synergistic effects of metformin and M2 macrophages on the dynamic balance of bone metabolism.

TI Octyl itaconate inhibits osteoclastogenesis by suppressing Hrd1 and

AB The endogenous metabolite itaconate has emerged as a regulator of macrophage function that limits inflammation. However, its effect on cell differentiation and osteoclast related diseases is unclear. Here, for the first time, we explored the effect of itaconate and its cell permeable itaconate derivative, 4 octyl itaconate (OI) on osteoclast differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Firstly, we demonstrated that itaconate concentration was lower in estrogen deficient mice. OI released itaconate and induced the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) in bone marrow derived macrophages during osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, OI significantly suppressed the early, middle, and late stages of osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand in vitro, as confirmed by tartrate resistant acid phosphatase staining. Moreover, it significantly inhibited fibrous actin ring formation and bone resorption in vitro. Mechanistically, we observed that OI enhanced Nrf2 expression by suppressing its association with ubiquitin via inhibition of the E3 ubiquitin ligase (Hrd1). OI also inhibited LPS induced the reactive oxygen species and inflammatory responses via Hrd1. An estrogen deficiency (via ovariectomy) induced osteoporosis model was also established. Here, on micro computed tomography and histologic analysis showed that OI effectively suppressed ovariectomy induced bone loss. In summary, OI, an itaconate derivative, can inhibit osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in vivo, indicating that OI could be a potential drug to treat osteoclast related diseases; our results also link itaconate to the development of osteoporosis.

AB Bone tissue engineering is an emerging medical field that has been developed in recent years to address pathologies with limited ability of bones to regenerate. Here we report the fabrication and characterization of microbial transglutaminase crosslinked gelatin based scaffolds designed for serving as both cell substrate and growth factor release system. In particular, morphological, biomechanical and biological features have been analyzed. The enzyme ratio applied during the fabrication of the scaffolds affects the swelling capacity and the mechanical properties of the final structure. The developed systems are not cytotoxic according to the biocompatibility tests. The biological performance of selected formulations was studied using L 929 fibroblasts, D1 MSC and MG63 osteoblasts. Moreover, scaffolds allowed efficient osteogenic differentiation and signaling of MSCs. MSC cultured on the scaffolds not only presented lower proliferative and stemness profile, but also increased expression of osteoblast related genes (Col1a1, Runx2, Osx). Furthermore, the in vitro release kinetics of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bone morphogenetic protein  2 (BMP 2) from the scaffolds were also investigated. The release of the growth factors produced from the scaffolds followed a first order kinetics. These results highlight that the scaffolds designed and developed in this work may be suitable candidates for bone tissue regeneration purposes.

AB Aging is a process whereby organisms lose to the capacity to effectively handle life's stresses. Associated with aging are pathophysiological processes, such as decreases in bone mass, which in the extreme form lead to significant morbidity. Evolutionary theory suggests that these pathophysiological processes are permitted to occur because an organism need only preserve its body against stress only for the amount of time needed for effective reproduction. In this review, an understanding of osteoporosis and bone loss is discussed within the context of aging theory. Specific topics covered include: (1) bone loss as an antagonistically pleiotropic physiological process, (2) age associated stress accumulation and its negative impact on bone turnover, and (3) the mechanisms whereby gonadal failure, increases in inflammatory cytokines, and cellular bone marrow changes lead to bone loss. This review concludes by examining purported hypotheses in the context of Werner's syndrome, a disease characterized by premature aging. We suggest that future osteoporosis therapy will likely focus on prevention of aging in general as a means to prevent the development of osteoporosis.

AB Acute myeloid leukemia is a heterogeneous disease with varying genetic and molecular pathologies. Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been proven to possess significant anti proliferative potential in various cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Hence, treatment with these agents can be utilized to study disease specific anti proliferative pathways. In this study, a total number of 42 bone marrow derived CD34(+) selected de novo AML patient samples and the AML cell lines THP 1 and HL 60 were treated with the NSAIDs Sulindac sulfide and Diclofenac. We analyzed viability, apoptosis, differentiation and addressed the molecular mechanisms involved. We found a consistent induction of apoptosis and to some extent an increased myeloid differentiation capacity in NSAID treated AML cells. Comprehensive protein and gene expression profiling of Diclofenac treated AML cells revealed transcriptional activation of GADD45 alpha and its downstream MAPK/JNK pathway as well as increased protein levels of the caspase 3 precursor. This pointed towards a role of the c Jun NH2 terminal kinase (JNK) in NSAID mediated apoptosis that we found indeed to be dependent on JNK activity as addition of a specific JNK inhibitor abrogated apoptosis. Furthermore, the AP 1 transcription factor family members' c Jun, JunB and Fra 2 were transcriptionally activated in NSAID treated AML cells and re expression of these transcription factors led to activation of GADD45 alpha with induction of apoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that NSAIDs induce apoptosis in AML through a novel pathway involving increased expression of AP 1 heterodimers, which by itself is sufficient to induce GADD45 alpha expression with consecutive activation of JNK and induction of apoptosis.

AB Aims Parathyroid hormone (PTH) has been shown to promote stem cell mobilization into peripheral blood. Moreover, PTH treatment after myocardial infarction (MI) improved survival and myocardial function associated with enhanced homing of bone marrow derived stem cells (BMCs). To unravel the molecular mechanisms of PTH mediated stem cell trafficking, we analysed wild type (wt) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice after MI with respect to the pivotal stromal cell derived factor 1 (SDF 1)/chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) axis.
   Methods and results WT and GFP transgenic mice (C57BL/6J) were infarcted by coronary artery ligation and PTH (80 mu g/kg/day) was injected for 6 days afterwards. Number of BMCs was analysed by flow cytometry. SDF 1 protein levels and activity of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) were investigated by ELISA and activity assay. Functional analyses were performed at day 30 after MI. PTH treated animals revealed an enhanced homing of CXCR4(+) BMCs associated with an increased protein level of the corresponding homing factor SDF 1 in the ischaemic heart. In vitro and in vivo, PTH inhibited the activity of DPP IV, which cleaves and inactivates SDF 1. Functionally, PTH significantly improved myocardial function after MI. Both stem cell homing as well as functional recovery were reversed by the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100.
   Conclusion In summary, PTH is a DPP IV inhibitor leading to an increased cardiac SDF 1 level, which enhances recruitment of CXCR4(+) BMCs into the ischaemic heart associated with attenuated ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Since PTH is already clinically used our findings may have direct impact on the initiation of studies in patients with ischaemic disorders.

TI Effect of the Abnormal Expression of BMP 4 in the Blood of Diabetic

AB The success rate of oral implants is lower in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients than in nondiabetic subjects; functional impairment of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) is an important underlying cause. Many factors in the blood can act on BMSCs to regulate their biological functions and influence implant osseointegration, but which factors play important negative roles in T2DM patients is still unclear. This study is aimed at screening differentially expressed genes in the blood from T2DM and nondiabetic patients, identifying which genes impact the osteogenic differentiation potential of alveolar BMSCs in T2DM patients, exploring drug intervention regimens, and providing a basis for improving implant osseointegration. Thus, a whole blood gene expression microarray dataset (GSE26168) of T2DM patients and nondiabetic controls was analyzed. Based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) results, differentially expressed genes and signaling pathways related to BMSC osteogenic differentiation were screened, and major risk genes were extracted based on the mean decrease Gini coefficient calculated using the random forest method. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP 4), with significantly low expression in T2DM blood, was identified as the most significant factor affecting BMSC osteogenic differentiation potential. Subsequently, metformin, a first line clinical drug for T2DM treatment, was found to improve the osteogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs from T2DM patients via the BMP 4/Smad/Runx2 signaling pathway. These results demonstrate that low BMP 4 expression in the blood of T2DM patients significantly hinders the osteogenic function of BMSCs and that metformin is effective in counteracting the negative impact of BMP 4 deficiency.

AB Context: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of death from cancer in males in most Western countries. Advanced PCa is initially sensitive to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) but eventually progresses to castration resistance. Most treatments of PCa currently available are based on either cytotoxicity directed against tumour cells (chemotherapy) or targeting the androgen receptor directly or indirectly.
   Objective: Targeting agents have recently been developed to treat a variety of cancers. New and promising targets have been identified, and new agents targeting these molecules are currently being studied in patients with PCa. Some of these major potential targets are reviewed in this article.
   Recent data on a selection of new targets and new targeting agents are summarised in this review.
   The androgen receptor axis is active in the setting of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and subsequent hormonemanipulation therapy showed anticancer activity using agents such as abiraterone or new generation androgen receptor inhibitors. Another treatment strategy to consider is the use of targeted therapy to directly treat bone metastases. Several bone targeting agents are currently in development, including ZD4054, which targets the endothelin type A receptor; denosumab, which targets the Rank ligand axis; and the combination of docetaxel based chemotherapy with samarium 153, a radiopharmaceutical agent. Moreover, a large number of other biological targets have been identified, and clinical trials are ongoing in a variety of PCa settings to test drugs targeting angiogenesis, proliferation, and apoptosis. A number of large randomized phase 3 trials are ongoing in patients with metastatic CRPC, and first results are awaited in 2009 2010.
   Conclusion: With the identification of new, promising biological targets and the availability of potentially active and well tolerated targeting agents, most patients with CRPC should be offered participation in clinical trials and should be referred to centres in which these trials are available.

AB Periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) appear to share many pathologic features. In this review, the common pathologic mechanisms of these two common chronic conditions are explored. Emerging evidence now suggests a strong relationship between the extent and severity of periodontal disease and RA. While this relationship is unlikely to be causal, it is clear that individuals with advanced RA are more likely to experience more significant periodontal problems compared to their non RA counterparts, and vice versa. A case is made that these two diseases could be very closely related through common underlying dysfunction of fundamental inflammatory mechanisms. The nature of such dysfunction is still unknown. Nonetheless, there is accruing evidence to support the notion that both conditions manifest as a result of an imbalance between proinflammatory and anti inflammatory cytokines. As a result, new treatment strategies are expected to emerge for both diseases that may target the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines and destructive proteases. The clinical implications of the current data dictate that patients with RA should be carefully screened for their periodontal status.

AB This study evaluated the morphological changes produced by LLLT on the initial stages of bone healing and also studied the pathways that stimulate the expression of genes related to bone cell proliferation and differentiation. One hundred Wistar rats were divided into control and treated groups. Noncritical size bone defects were surgically created at the upper third of the tibia. Laser irradiation (Ga Al As laser 830 nm, 30 mW, 94 s, 2.8 J) was performed for 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 sessions. Histopathology revealed that treated animals produced increased amount of newly formed bone at the site of the injury. Moreover, microarray analysis evidenced that LLLT produced a significant increase in the expression TGF beta, BMP, FGF, and RUNX 2 that could stimulate osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, which may be related to improving the deposition of newly formed bone at the site of the injury. Thus, it is possible to conclude that LLLT improves bone healing by producing a significant increase in the expression of osteogenic genes.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the alveolar bone tissue inflammatory response in rats undergoing zoledronic acid therapy. The study sample was composed of 28 Wistar rats. Animals from the test group GTa received a weekly intraperitoneal dose of 0.2 mg/kg of zoledronic acid for 3 weeks, while test group GTb received the same dose for 8 weeks. A physiological saline dose, equivalent to that of the medication, was administered to the controls in groups GCa and GCb. A defect was created in the dental crown of the lower first molars using a drill to simulate pulp and periapical injury. Data were evaluated regarding image grey levels by cone beam computed tomography and histologically by assigning scores for the presence of inflammatory infiltrate, type of infiltrate, vascularization, bone necrosis and dental resorption. Grey levels in the 3 week therapy group (GTa) showed more pronounced changes in comparison with those seen in the GCa group (P < 0.05). Evaluation of the scores demonstrated no association between any of the variables amongst the groups (>0.05). However, bone remodelling decreased in the groups receiving the medication. Bone necrosis was present more frequently in group GTb than in the control group GCb. The results suggest that the drug interfered in the reaction capacity of the alveolar bone tissue as test group GTa showed higher grey levels in comparison to the control group GCa. In addition, there was less bone remodelling activity, with the appearance of bone necrosis zones and intense acute inflammatory infiltrate associated with the 8 week therapy group GTb.

AB We examined the effects of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) serum on proliferation, differentiation, mineralization, and apoptosis of human osteoblast cells (hOb) in culture. The hOb were cultured with 10% serum from active pJIA and healthy controls (CT) and were tested for DNA synthesis, alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity, osteocalcin (OC) secretion, calcium levels, caspase 3 activity, and DNA fragmentation. None of the patients had used glucocorticoids for at least 1 month before the study, or any other drug that can affect bone mineral metabolism. Human inflammatory cytokine levels (IL 6, IL 8, IL 10, IL 1 beta, TNF alpha, and IL 12p70) were measured in pJIA and CT sera. Low levels of AP activity was observed in pJIA cultures compared with CT cultures (67.16 +/  53.35 vs 100.11 +/  50.64 mu mol p nitrophenol/h( 1) mg( 1) protein, P=0.008). There was also a significant decrease in OC secretion (9.23 +/  5.63 vs 12.82 +/  7.02 ng/mg protein, P=0.012) and calcium levels (0.475 +/  0.197 vs 0.717 +/  0.366 mmol/l, P=0.05) in pJIA hOb cultures. No difference was observed in cell proliferation (323.56 +/  108.23 vs 328.91 +/  88.03 dpm/mg protein, P=0.788). Osteoblasts cultured with JIA sera showed lower levels of DNA and increased fragmentation than osteoblasts cultured with CT sera. pJIA sera showed higher IL 6 values than CT (21.44 +/  9.31 vs 3.58 +/  2.38 pg/ml, P<0.001), but no difference was observed related to IL 8, IL 10, IL 1 beta, TNF alpha, and IL 12p70 between pJIA and controls. This study suggests that serum from children with pJIA inhibits differentiation, mineralization and may increase apoptosis of hOb cultures, and inflammatory cytokines such as IL 6 might be a mechanism in this find. These results may represent an alternative therapeutic target for prevention and treatment of bone loss in JIA.

AB Background The present study assesses the effect of the stem cell antigen 1 positive (Sca 1(+)) cell based human growth hormone (hGH) ex vivo gene transfer strategy on endosteal bone mass in the mouse.
   Methods Sublethally irradiated recipient mice were transplanted with Sca 1(+) cells transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing hGH or beta galactosidase control genes. Bone parameters were assessed by microcomputed tomography and histomorphometry.
   Results This hGH strategy drastically increased hGH mRNA levels in bone marrow cells and serum insulin like growth factor I (IGF I) (by nearly 50%, p < 0.002) in hGH recipient mice. Femoral trabecular bone volume of the hGH mice was significantly reduced by 35% (p < 0.002). The hGH mice also had decreased trabecular number (by 26%; p < 0.0001), increased trabecular separation (by 38%; p < 0.0002) and reduced trabecular connectivity density (by 64%; p < 0.001), as well as significantly more osteoclasts (2.5 fold; p < 0.05) and greater osteoclastic surface per bone surface (2.6 fold; p < 0.01).
   Conclusions Targeted expression of hGH in cells of marrow cavity through the Sca 1(+) cell based gene transfer strategy increased circulating IGF I and decreased endosteal bone mass through an increase in resorption in recipient mice. These results indicate that high local levels of hGH or IGF I in the bone marrow microenvironment enhanced resorption, which is consistent with previous findings in transgenic mice with targeted bone IGF I expression showing that high local IGF I expression increased bone remodeling, favoring a net bone loss. Thus, GH and/or IGF I would not be an appropriate transgene for use in this Sca 1(+) cell based gene transfer strategy to promote endosteal bone formation. Published 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The structure, material composition and mass of bone determine its strength. These are affected by the rate of bone remodeling which increases after the menopause and is an independent determinant of bone fragility. The relationship between individual determinants of bone strength and bone fragility is, however, complex and cannot be accurately assessed in clinical practice. Despite this limitation, tools currently available to physicians help to identify individuals at higher risk for fracture and to obtain a fair estimate of this risk. In addition, use of such tools in the evaluation of the response to pharmacological interventions helps to understand the mechanism of their antifracture efficacy. Further research, as well as routine application of new technologies, will lead to better identification of patients at risk for fractures and in the selection of individuals who will benefit most from specific interventions.

AB Vascularization and bone regeneration are closely related in the process of bone remodeling, and de signing a bioactive scaffold with pro angiogenic and osteogenic properties may accelerate the repair of bone defects. In this work, an iron based metal organic framework (MIL 88) was developed as a carrier for loading a pro angiogenic small molecular drug (dimethyloxallyl glycine, DMOG), and then embed ded into the PLGA nanofibrous scaffolds to repair cranial defects in rats. Imaging and histological eval uation indicated that PLGA/MIL@D scaffold markedly enhanced vascularization and bone regeneration in vivo . Moreover, in vitro assay showed that co delivery system significantly promoted angiogenesis by stimulating endothelial cell migration, tube formation, and enhanced osteogenesis by promoting expres sion of osteoblast related proteins. In addition, PLGA/MIL@D scaffold promotes angiogenesis by activating the hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF 1)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway. Al together, this bioactive PLGA/MIL@D scaffold can combine angiogenesis with osteogenesis, and will be a bright strategy for the repair of bone defects.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese Chemical Society and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

AB Proinflammatory cytokines are infamous for their catabolic effects on tissues and joints in both inflammatory diseases and following the implantation of biomedical devices. However, recent studies indicate that many of these same molecules are critical for triggering tissue regeneration following injury. This review will discuss the role of inflammatory signals in regulating bone regeneration and the impact of both immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory pharmacologic agents on fracture healing, to demonstrate the importance of incorporating rational control of inflammation into the design of tissue engineering strategies.

AB The effect of long chain 2 alkylaminoethyl 1,1 bisphosphonates against proliferation of the clinically more relevant form of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of American trypanosomiasis (Chagas' disease), and against tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii was investigated. Particularly, compound 26 proved to be an extremely potent inhibitor against the intracellular form of T. cruzi, exhibiting IC50 values at the nanomolar range. This cellular activity was associated with a strong inhibition of the enzymatic activity of T. cruzi farnesyl diphosphate synthase (TcFPPS), which constitutes a valid target for Chagas' disease chemotherapy. Compound 26 was an effective agent against T. cruzi (amastigotes) exhibiting an IC50 value of 0.67 mu M, while this compound showed an IC50 value of 0.81 mu M against the target enzyme TcFPPS. This drug was less effective against the enzymatic activity of T. cruzi solanesyl diphosphate synthase TcSPPS showing an IC50 value of 3.2 mu M. Interestingly, compound 26 was also very effective against T. gondii (tachyzoites) exhibiting IC50 values of 6.23 mu M. This cellular activity was also related to the inhibition of the enzymatic activity towards the target enzyme TgFPPS (IC50 = 0.093 mu M) As bisphosphonate containing compounds are FDA approved drugs for the treatment of bone resorption disorders, their potential low toxicity makes them good candidates to control different tropical diseases.

AB Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) regulates many vital signaling pathways and plays a critical role in cell proliferation, survival, migration, and resistance. Previously, we reported that a small molecule, KS99, is an inhibitor of tubulin polymerization. In the present study, we explored whether KS99 is a dual inhibitor of BTK and tubulin polymerization. Although it is known that BTK is required for clonogenic growth and resistance, and microtubules are essential for cancer cell growth, dual targeting of these two components has not been explored previously. Through docking studies, we predicted that KS99 interacts directly with the catalytic domain of BTK and inhibits phosphorylation at the Y223 residue and kinase activities. Treatment of KS99 reduces the cell viability of multiple myeloma (MM) and CD138(+) cells, with an IC50 of between 0.5 and 1.0 mu mol/L. We found that KS99 is able to induce apoptosis in MM cells in a caspase dependent manner. KS99 suppressed the receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand (RANKL) induced differentiation of macrophages to osteoclasts in a dose dependent manner and, importantly, inhibited the expression of cytokines associated with bone loss. Finally, we found that KS99 inhibits the in vivo tumor growth of MM cells through the inhibition of BTK and tubulin. Overall, our results show that dual inhibition of BTK and tubulin polymerization by KS99 is a viable option in MM treatment, particularly in the inhibition of refraction and relapse.

AB The effectiveness of the developed combined drug as capsule and suspension dosage forms based on dimephosphoneA (R) (dimethyl 1,1 dimethyl 3 oxobutylphosphonate) and calcium carbonate was demonstrated for treatment and prophylaxis of bone diseases. According to IR spectra, dimephosphoneA (R) was chemisorbed to calcium ions on the surface of calcium carbonate to form surface calcium phosphonates. DimephosphoneA (R) adsorption (A) as a function of its concentration (C) in aqueous solutions obeyed formally the Langmuir equation. The remodeling action for bone tissue by the suspension dosage form was verified using a glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis model in rats.

AB Mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly respiratory chain disruption, is often responsible for aging related bone diseases. In this study, the protective effects of glabridin, an isoflavan isolated from licorice root, against pharmacological inhibition of the respiratory chain were studied using osteoblastic MC3T3 E1 cells treated with antimycin A, which inhibits complex III of the electron transport system. Glabridin restored mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation, ATP loss, inactivation of complex IV, intracellular calcium elevation, and cytochrome c release that was induced by antimycin A treatment. This compound also prevented cell death. These results imply that glabridin protects osteoblasts from antimycin A induced cell death via improved mitochondrial function. Glabridin scavenged ROS and mitochondrial superoxide anions generated by antimycin A. In addition, glabridin prevented antimycin A induced nitrotyrosine increase and thioredoxin reductase inactivation, suggesting that glabridin may be useful for protecting mitochondria against a burst of oxidative stress. Since phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) signaling is known to be pro survival, we determined whether PI3K and CREB activation is associated with the cytoprotective effects of glabridin in the MC3T3 E1 cells. Glabridin restored antimycin A induced inactivation of PI3K and CREB, suggesting that PI3K and CREB dependent pathways may be involved in glabridin induced cytoprotective responses. Our study demonstrates that glabridin reduces mitochondrial dysfunction induced during aging, and could significantly prevent osteoblast damage in osteoporotic patients.

AB Increased intracellular free calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration induces excessive oxidative stress and apoptosis. Medical procedures such as zoledronic acid (Zol), bevacizumab (Bev), and dexamethasone (Dex) are usually used in the treatment of bone diseases (osteoporosis, Paget's disease, etc.) and to prevent metastasis in the bone although the procedures induce osteonecrosis of the jaw through excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recently, we observed regulator roles of selenium (Se) on apoptosis and Ca2+ entry through transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels in the cancer cell lines. Therefore, Se may modulate Zol, Bev, and Dex induced oxidative stress and apoptosis through regulation of TRPV1 channel. In the current study, we investigated the protective effects of Se on apoptosis and oxidative stress through TRPV1 in Zol, Bev, and Dex induced osteoblast like cell line. We used human osteoblast like cell line (Saos 2), and the cells were divided into 12 groups as control, Zol, Bev, Dex, Se, Zol+Se, Bev+Se, Dex+Se, Zol+Dex, Zol+Dex+Se, Zol+Bev, and Zol+Bev+Se which were incubated with drugs (Zol, Bev, Dex, and Se) for 24 h. The cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration was increased by Zol, Bev, Dex, Zol+Bev, and Zol+Dex, although it was reduced by Se treatment. However, Zol, Bev, and Dex induced increase in apoptosis, caspase 3, caspase 9, poly (ADP ribose) polymerase 1 expression levels, and intracellular ROS production values in the cells were decreased by Se treatments. In conclusion, we observed that Zol, Bev, and Dex induced apoptosis, mitochondrial oxidative stress, and calcium signaling are decreased in human osteoblast like cell line by the Se treatment. Our findings may be relevant to the etiology and treatment of Zol, Bev, and Dex induced osteonecrosis by Se.

AB Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease closely associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) involvement. Eliminating ROS to control the periodontal microenvironment and alleviate the inflammatory response could potentially serve as an efficacious therapy for periodontitis. Melatonin (MT), renowned for its potent antioxidant and anti inflammatory characteristics, is frequently employed as an ROS scavenger in inflammatory diseases. However, the therapeutic efficacy of MT remains unsatisfactory due to the low water solubility and poor bioavailability. Carbon dots have emerged as a promising and innovative nanomaterial with facile synthesis, environmental friendliness, and low cost. In this study, melatonin derived carbon dots (MT CDs) were successfully synthesized via the hydrothermal method. The MT CDs have good water solubility and biocompatibility and feature excellent ROS scavenging capacity without additional modification. The in vitro experiments proved that MT CDs efficiently regulated intracellular ROS, which maintained mitochondrial homeostasis and suppressed the production of inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, findings from the mouse model of periodontitis indicated that MT CDs significantly inhibited the deterioration of alveolar bone and reduced osteoclast activation and inflammation, thereby contributing to the regeneration of damaged tissue. In terms of the mechanism, MT CDs may scavenge ROS, thereby preventing cellular damage and the production of inflammatory factors by regulating the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase 1 (HO 1) pathway. The findings will offer a vital understanding of the advancement of secure and effective ROS scavenging platforms for more biomedical applications.

AB Background: Bowing and/or pseudarthrosis of the tibia is a known severe complication of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Mice with conditionally inactivated neurofibromin (Nf1) in the developing limbs and cranium (Nf1Prx1) show bowing of the tibia caused by decreased bone mineralisation and increased bone vascularisation. However, in contrast to NF1 patients, spontaneous fractures do not occur in Nf1Prx1 mice probably due to the relatively low mechanical load. We studied bone healing in a cortical bone injury model in Nf1Prx1 mice as a model for NF1 associated bone disease. Taking advantage of this experimental model we explore effects of systemically applied lovastatin, a cholesterol lowering drug, on the Nf1 deficient bone repair.
   Methods: Cortical injury was induced bilaterally in the tuberositas tibiae in Nf1Prx1 mutant mice and littermate controls according to a method described previously. Paraffin as well as methacrylate sections were analysed from each animal. We divided 24 sex matched mutant mice into a lovastatin treated and an untreated group. The lovastatin treated mice received 0.15 mg activated lovastatin by daily gavage. The bone repair process was analysed at three consecutive time points post injury, using histological methods, micro computed tomography measurements and in situ hybridisation. At each experimental time point, three lovastatin treated mutant mice, three untreated mutant mice and three untreated control mice were analysed. The animal group humanely killed on day 14 post injury was expanded to six treated and six untreated mutant mice as well as six control mice.
   Results: Bone injury repair is a complex process, which requires the concerted effort of numerous cell types. It is initiated by an inflammatory response, which stimulates fibroblasts from the surrounding connective tissue to proliferate and fill in the injury site with a provisional extracellular matrix. In parallel, mesenchymal progenitor cells from the periost are recruited into the injury site to become osteoblasts. In Nf1Prx1 mice bone repair is delayed and characterised by the excessive formation and the persistence of fibro cartilaginous tissue and impaired extracellular matrix mineralisation. Correspondingly, expression of Runx2 is downregulated. High dose systemic lovastatin treatment restores Runx2 expression and accelerates new bone formation, thus improving cortical bone repair in Nf1Prx1 tibia. The bone anabolic effects correlate with a reduction of the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway hyper activation in Nf1 deficient cells.
   Conclusion: Our data suggest the potential usefulness of lovastatin, a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1987 for the treatment of hypercholesteraemia, in the treatment of Nf1 related fracture healing abnormalities. The experimental model presented here constitutes a valuable tool for the pre clinical stage testing of candidate drugs, targeting Nf1 associated bone dysplasia.

AB Context: Children with 21 hydroxylase deficiency (21 OHD) need chronic glucocorticoid (cGC) therapy to replace congenital deficit of cortisol synthesis. cGC therapy is the most frequent and severe form of drug induced osteoporosis, and different mechanisms have been proposed to explain its pathogenesis.
   Objective: We investigated the osteoclastogenic potential of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 18 children with 21 OHD on cGC therapy and 25 controls who never received GCs. We also evaluated the presence of circulating osteoclast precursors (OCPs) and the role of T cells in osteoclast formation.
   Results: Spontaneous osteoclastogenesis, without adding macrophage colony stimulating factor and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), and significantly higher osteoclasts resorption activity occurred in 21 OHD patients. Conversely, macrophage colony stimulating factor and RANKL were essential to trigger and sustain osteoclastogenesis in controls. Furthermore, in 21 OHD patients, we identified a significant percentage of CD11b CD51/CD61 and CD51/61 RANK positive cells, which are OCPs strongly committed. Additionally, we demonstrated a T cell dependent osteoclastogenesis from 21 OHD patients' PBMCs. T cells from patients expressed high levels of RANKL and low levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG) with respect to controls. Moreover, 21 OHD patients had higher soluble RANKL and lower OPG serum levels compared with controls; thus, soluble RANKL to OPG ratio was significantly higher in patients than controls.
   Conclusions: The present study showed for the first time a high osteoclastogenic potential of PBMCs from 21 OHD patients on cGC therapy. This spontaneous osteoclastogenesis seems to be supported by both the presence of circulating OCPs and factors released by T cells. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 94: 2269 2276, 2009)

AB Lung and airway epithelial cells generated in vitro from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have applications in regenerative medicine, modeling of lung disease, drug screening and studies of human lung development. Here we describe a strategy for directed differentiation of hPSCs into developmental lung progenitors, and their subsequent differentiation into predominantly distal lung epithelial cells. The protocol entails four stages that recapitulate lung development, and it takes similar to 50 d. First, definitive endoderm (DE) is induced in the presence of high concentrations of activin A. Subsequently, lung biased anterior foregut endoderm (AFE) is specified by sequential inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) and Wnt signaling. AFE is then ventralized by applying Wnt, BMP, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and retinoic acid (RA) signaling to obtain lung and airway progenitors. Finally, these are further differentiated into more mature epithelial cells types using Wnt, FGF, cAMP and glucocorticoid agonism. This protocol is conducted in defined conditions, it does not involve genetic manipulation of the cells and it results in cultures in which the majority of the cells express markers of various lung and airway epithelial cells, with a predominance of cells identifiable as functional type II alveolar epithelial cells.

AB Increased bone turnover may produce a disturbance in bone structure which may result in fracture. In cortical bone, both reduction in turnover and increase in hip bone mineral density (BMD) may be necessary to decrease hip fracture risk and may require relatively greater proportionate changes than for trabecular bone. It should also be noted that increased porosity produces disproportionate reduction in bone strength, and studies have shown that increased cortical porosity and decreased cortical thickness are associated with hip fracture. Continued studies for determining the causes of bone strength and deterioration show distinct promise. Osteocyte viability has been observed to be an indicator of bone strength, with viability as the result of maintaining physiological levels of loading and osteocyte apoptosis as the result of a decrease in loading. Osteocyte apoptosis and decrease are major factors in the bone loss and fracture associated with aging. Both the osteocyte and periosteal cell layer are assuming greater importance in the process of maintaining skeletal integrity as our knowledge of these cells expand, as well being a target for pharmacological agents to reduce fracture especially in cortical bone. The bisphosphonate alendronate has been seen to have a positive effect on cortical bone by allowing customary periosteal growth, while reducing the rate of endocortical bone remodeling and slowing bone loss from the endocortical surface. Risedronate treatment effects were attributed to decrease in bone resorption and thus a decrease in fracture risk. lbandronate has been seen to increase BMD as the spine and femur as well as a reduced incidence of new vertebral fractures and non vertebral on subset post hoc analysis. And treatment with the anabolic agent PTH(1 34) documented modeling and remodelling of quiescent and active bone surfaces. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) plays a key role in bone destruction, and the human monoclonal antibody denosumab binds to RANKL, inhibiting its action and thus improving BMD significantly.

AB Stroke is a major disease that leads to high mortality and morbidity. Given the ageing population and the potential risk factors, the prevalence of stroke and socioeconomic burden associated with stroke are expected to increase. During the past decade, both prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for stroke have made significant progress. However, current therapies still cannot adequately improve the outcomes of stroke and may not apply to all patients. One of the significant advances in modern medicine is cell derived neurovascular regeneration and neuronal repair. Progress in stem cell biology has greatly contributed to ameliorating stroke related brain injuries in preclinical studies and demonstrated clinical potential in stroke treatment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the differentiating potential of chondrocytes, adipocytes, and osteoblasts, and they have the ability to transdifferentiate into endothelial cells, glial cells, and neurons. Due to their great plasticity, MSCs have drawn much attention from the scientific community. This review will focus on MSCs, stem cells widely utilized in current medical research, and evaluate their effect and potential of improving outcomes in ischemic stroke.

TI STIM1 and TRPV4 regulate fluid flow induced calcium oscillation at early

AB Bone resorption is mainly mediated by osteoclasts (OCs), whose formation and function are regulated by intracellular Ca2+ oscillation. Our previous studies demonstrated that fluid shear stress (FSS) lead to Ca2+ oscillation through mechanosensitive cation selective channels. However, the specific channels responsible for this FSS induced Ca2+ oscillation remain unknown. In the present study, we examined the expression of several Ca2+ channels in OCs, including STIM1, ORAI1, TRPV1, TRPV4, TRPV5, and TRPV6, by western blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that STIM1 was highly expressed in early stage OCs, while TRPV4 was highly expressed in late stage OCs. We observed intracellular Ca2+ responses in OCs that were mechanically stimulated by FSS. When we blocked STIM1 dependent store operated Ca2+ entry or inhibited TRPV4 using siRNA or drug inhibition, FSS induced Ca2+ oscillations were almost undetectable in early and late stage OCs, respectively. These results indicate that STIM1 and TRPV4 act as mechanical transduction channels for OCs during the early and late differentiation stages, respectively, suggesting that these calcium channel could serve as markers of osteoclastogenesis or bone resorption.

AB Secondary hyperparathyroidism   a common comorbid condition in patients with chronic renal insufficiency   is considered a consequence of critical determinants such as hypocalcemia, phosphate retention and reduced levels of calcitriol production. In this complex mechanism, the skeletal apparatus and the nonskeletal targets such as vascular and heart valves are often involved, thus explaining the increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of uremic patients.
   In this review we will focus on the major role played by Calcitriol deficiency as a trigger of secondary hyperparathyroidism and the crucial need for obiquitous vitamin D receptor activation in order to have an optimal PTH control and to obtain a modulation between inhibitors and inducers of soft tissue calcification. This review will also elucidate the possible role of paricalcitol   a new vitamin D analog   in conditioning morbidity and mortality of patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT).

AB Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are used for several therapeutic applications to improve the functions of bone, cardiac, nervous tissue as well as to facilitate the repopulation of hematopoietic stem cells. MSC give rise to the non hematopoietic stromal cells of the bone marrow and are important for the maintenance of normal hematopoiesis. Chemotherapeutic drugs used for treatment of leukemia extensively damage the stromal cells and alter their gene expression profiles.
   Methods: We determined the changes in adipogenic, osteogenic differentiation, phenotypic and gene expression in MSC during treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs cytarabine, daunorubicin and vincristine. We also tested anti cancer effects of drug treated MSC on leukemia cells.
   Results: Treatment with the chemotherapeutic drugs resulted in functional defects in MSC, leading to reduced proliferation, osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. The drug treated MSC also showed decreased expression of cell surface receptors, and the changes in proliferation, phenotype and differentiation defect was partially reversible after withdrawing the drugs from the cells. The drug treated MSC showed increased expression of cytokines, IL6, FGF2 and TNFA but reduced levels of differentiation markers SOX9 and ACTC1. Drug treated MSC also contributed to reduced anti cancer effects in leukemia cells.
   Conclusions: Chemotherapeutic drug treatment altered the phenotype, osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential of MSC and modified the gene expression profile of the cells to render them more chemoprotective of the leukemic cells. Thus, additional therapeutic efforts to target the stromal cell population will help in preventing chemoresistance, disease relapse in leukemia and to maintain a healthy bone marrow stroma.

AB Human adipose derived stem/stromal cells (hASCs) can differentiate into specialized cell types and thereby contribute to tissue regeneration. As such, hASCs have drawn increasing attention in cell therapy and regenerative medicine, not to mention the ease to isolate them from donors. Culture conditions are critical for expanding hASCs while maintaining optimal therapeutic capabilities. Here, we identified a role for transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) in culture medium in influencing the fate of hASCs during in vitro cell expansion. Human ASCs obtained after expansion in standard culture medium (Standard hASCs) and in endothelial cell growth medium 2 (EGM2 hASCs) were characterized by high throughput transcriptional studies, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and functional properties. EGM2 hASCs exhibited enhanced multipotency capabilities and an immature phenotype compared with Standard hASCs. Moreover, the adipogenic potential of EGM2 hASCs was enhanced, including toward beige adipogenesis, compared with Standard hASCs. In these conditions, TGF beta 1 acts as a critical factor affecting the immaturity and multipotency of Standard hASCs, as suggested by small mother of decapentaplegic homolog 3 (SMAD3) nuclear localization and phosphorylation in Standard hASCs vs EGM2 hASCs. Finally, the typical priming of Standard hASCs into osteoblast, chondroblast, and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) lineages was counteracted by pharmacological inhibition of the TGF beta 1 receptor, which allowed retention of SMAD3 into the cytoplasm and a decrease in expression of osteoblast and VSMC lineage markers. Overall, the TGF beta 1 pathway appears critical in influencing the commitment of hASCs toward osteoblast, chondroblast, and VSMC lineages, thus reducing their adipogenic potential. These effects can be counteracted by using EGM2 culture medium or chemical inhibition of the TGF beta 1 pathway.

AB Objective: Cancer induced bone pain is a common clinical problem in breast cancer patients with bone metastasis. However, the mechanisms driving cancer induced bone pain are poorly known. Recent studies show that a novel protease, asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) plays crucial roles in breast cancer metastasis and progression. We aim to determine the functions and targeted suppress of AEP in a mouse model of breast cancer induced bone pain.
   Methods: Breast cancer cells with AEP knocked down or overexpression were constructed and implanted into the intramedullary space of the femur to induce pain like behavior in mice. AEP specific inhibitors or purified AEP proteins were further used in animal model. The histological characters of femur and pain ethological changes were measured. The expressions of AEP and neurotrophin receptors (p75NTR and TrkA) in dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord were examined.
   Results: Femur radiographs and histological analysis revealed that cells with AEP knocked down reduced bone destruction and pain behaviors. However, cells with AEP overexpression elevated bone damage and pain behaviors. Further, Western blot results found that the expressions of p75NTR and TrkA in dorsal root ganglions and spinal cords were reduced in mice inoculated with AEP knocked down cells. Targeted suppression of AEP with specific small compounds significantly reduced the bone pain while purified recombinant AEP proteins increased bone pain.
   Conclusions: AEP aggravate the development of breast cancer bone metastasis and bone pain by increasing the expression of neurotrophin receptors. AEP might be an effective target for treatment of breast cancerinduced bone pain.

AB The progress in the understanding of biological events underlying multiple myeloma (MM) development and progression has allowed the design of molecularly targeted therapies (MTTs) for this disease and several new compounds are presently under investigation in the preclinical and clinical settings. The recent discovery that miRNAs, and short non coding RNAs in general, are involved in the pathogenesis of cancer has raised the issue whether a novel therapeutic approach should be provided by selective interference with miRNA network. This review will focus on the rationale of miRNA based therapeutics, providing the most relevant information on biogenesis and technical issues in miRNA analysis. Finally, a detailed overview of the recent findings on miRNA therapeutics of MM will be discussed.

AB Nano hydroxyapatite (nano HA) has attracted substantial attention in the field of regenerative medicine. Endothelial cell (EC) mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) interactions are necessary for bone reconstruction, but the manner in which nano HA interacts in this process remains unknown. Herein, we investigated the cytotoxicity and osteoinductive effects of HA nanoparticles (HANPs) on MSCs using an indirect co culture model mediated by ECs and highlighted the underlying mechanisms. It was found that at a subcytotoxic dose, HANPs increased the viability and expression of osteoblast genes, as well as mineralized nodules and alkaline phosphatase production of MSCs. These phenomena relied on HIF 1 alpha secreted by ECs, which triggered the ERK1/2 signaling cascade. In addition, a two stage cell lineage mathematical model was established to quantitatively analyze the impact of HIF 1 alpha on the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. It demonstrated that HIF 1 alpha exerted a dose dependent stimulatory effect on the osteogenic differentiation rate of MSCs up to 1500 pg/mL, which was in agreement with the above results. Our data implied that cooperative interactions between HANPs, ECs, and MSCs likely serve to stimulate bone regeneration. Furthermore, the two stage cell lineage model is helpful in vitro system for assessing the potential influence of effector molecules in bone tissue engineering.

AB Chronic kidney disease mineral bone disorder (CKD MBD) is a complex clinical syndrome responsible for the accelerated cardiovascular mortality seen in individuals afflicted with CKD. Current approaches to therapy have failed to improve clinical outcomes adequately, likely due to targeting surrogate biochemical parameters as articulated by the guideline developer, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). We hypothesized that using a Systems Biology Approach combining machine learning with mathematical modeling, we could test a novel approach to therapy targeting the abnormal movement of mineral out of bone and into soft tissue that is characteristic of CKD MBD. The mathematical model describes the movement of calcium and phosphate between body compartments in response to standard therapeutic agents. The machine learning technique we applied is reinforcement learning (RL). We compared calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and mineral movement out of bone and into soft tissue under four scenarios: standard approach (KDIGO), achievement of KDIGO guidelines using RL (RLKDIGO), targeting abnormal mineral flux (RLFLUX), and combining achievement of KDIGO guidelines with minimization of abnormal mineral flux (RLKDIGOFLUX). We demonstrate through simulations that explicitly targeting abnormal mineral flux significantly decreases abnormal mineral movement compared with standard approach while achieving acceptable biochemical outcomes. These investigations highlight the limitations of current therapeutic targets, primarily secondary hyperparathyroidism, and emphasize the central role of deranged phosphate homeostasis in the genesis of the CKD MBD syndrome. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool for exploration of complex processes but application to clinical syndromes is challenging. Using a mathematical model describing the movement of calcium and phosphate between body compartments combined with machine learning, we show the feasibility of testing alternative goals of therapy for Chronic Kidney Disease Mineral Bone Disorder while maintaining acceptable biochemical outcomes. These simulations demonstrate the potential for using this platform to generate and test hypotheses in silico rapidly, inexpensively, and safely.

AB Background: Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial pediatric solid tumor. Intermittent hypoxia, which is characterized by cyclic periods of hypoxia and reoxygenation, has been shown to positively modulate tumor development and thereby induce tumor growth, angiogenic processes, and metastasis. Bone is one of the target organs of metastasis in advanced neuroblastoma Neuroblastoma cells produce osteoclast activating factors that increase bone resorption by the osteoclasts. The present study focuses on how intermittent hypoxia preconditioned SH SY5Y neuroblastoma cells modulate osteoclastogenesis in RAW 264.7 cells compared with neuroblastoma cells grown at normoxic conditions.
   Methods: We inhibited HIF 1 alpha and HIF 2 alpha in neuroblastoma SH SY5Y cells by siRNA/shRNA approaches. Protein expression of HIF 1 alpha, HIF 2 alpha and MAPKs were investigated by western blotting. Expression of osteoclastogenic factors were determined by real time RT PCR. The influence of intermittent hypoxia and HIF 1 alpha siRNA on migration of neuroblastoma cells and in vitro differentiation of RAW 264.7 cells were assessed. Intratibial injection was performed with SH SY5Y stable luciferase expressing cells and in vivo bioluminescence imaging was used in the analysis of tumor growth in bone.
   Results: Upregulation of mRNAs of osteoclastogenic factors VEGF and RANKL was observed in intermittent hypoxia exposed neuroblastoma cells. Conditioned medium from the intermittent hypoxia exposed neuroblastoma cells was found to enhance osteoclastogenesis, up regulate the mRNAs of osteoclast marker genes including TRAP, CaSR and cathepsin K and induce the activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 in RAW 264.7 cells. Intermittent hypoxia exposed neuroblastoma cells showed an increased migratory pattern compared with the parental cells. A significant increase of tumor volume was found in animals that received the intermittent hypoxia exposed cells intratibially compared with parental cells.
   Conclusions: Intermittent hypoxic exposure enhanced capabilities of neuroblastoma cells in induction of osteoclast differentiation in RAW 264.7 cells. Increased migration and intratibial tumor growth was observed in intermittent hypoxia exposed neuroblastoma cells compared with parental cells.

AB Bone formation and resorption are typically coupled, such that the efficacy of anabolic osteoporosis treatments may be limited by bone destruction. The multi kinase inhibitor YKL 05 099 potently inhibits salt inducible kinases (SIKs) and may represent a promising new class of bone anabolic agents. Here, we report that YKL 05 099 increases bone formation in hypogonadal female mice without increasing bone resorption. Postnatal mice with inducible, global deletion of SIK2 and SIK3 show increased bone mass, increased bone formation, and, distinct from the effects of YKL 05 099, increased bone resorption. No cell intrinsic role of SIKs in osteoclasts was noted. In addition to blocking SIKs, YKL 05 099 also binds and inhibits CSF1R, the receptor for the osteoclastogenic cytokine M CSF. Modeling reveals that YKL 05 099 binds to SIK2 and CSF1R in a similar manner. Dual targeting of SIK2/3 and CSF1R induces bone formation without concomitantly increasing bone resorption and thereby may overcome limitations of most current anabolic osteoporosis therapies.

AB One of only a few approved and available anabolic treatments for severe osteoporosis is daily injections of PTH (1 34). This drug has a specific dual action which can act either anabolically or catabolically depending on the type of administration, i. e. intermittent or continuous, respectively. In this paper, we present a mechanistic pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic model of the action of PTH in postmenopausal osteoporosis. This model accounts for anabolic and catabolic activities in bone remodelling under intermittent and continuous administration of PTH. The model predicts evolution of common bone biomarkers and bone volume fraction (BV/TV) over time. We compared the relative changes in BV/TV resulting from a daily injection of 20 mu g of PTH with experimental data from the literature. Simulation results indicate a site specific bone gain of 8.66% (9.4 +/  1.13%) at the lumbar spine and 3.14% (2.82 +/  0.72%) at the femoral neck. Bone gain depends nonlinearly on the administered dose, being, respectively, 0.68%, 3.4% and 6.16% for a 10, 20 and 40 mu g PTH dose at the FN over 2 years. Simulations were performed also taking into account a bone mechanical disuse to reproduce elderly frail subjects. The results show that mechanical disuse ablates the effects of PTH and leads to a 1.08% reduction of bone gain at the FN over a 2 year treatment period for the 20 mu g of PTH. The developed model can simulate a range of pathological conditions and treatments in bones including different PTH doses, different mechanical loading environments and combinations. Consequently, the model can be used for testing and generating hypotheses related to synergistic action between PTH treatment and physical activity.

AB Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold great potential for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering applications. They have multipotent differentiation capabilities and have been shown to differentiate down various lineages, including osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, myocytes, and possibly neurons. The majority of approaches to control the MSC fate have been via the use of chemical factors in the form of growth factors within the culture medium. More recently, it has been understood that mechanical forces play a significant role in regulating MSC fate. We and others have shown that mechanical stimuli can control MSC lineage specification. The cytoskeleton is known to play a large role in mechanotransduction, and a growing number of studies are showing that it can also contribute to MSC differentiation. This review analyzes the significant contribution of actin and integrin distribution, and the smaller role of microtubules, in regulating MSC fate. Osteogenic differentiation is more prevalent in MSCs with a stiff, spread actin cytoskeleton and greater numbers of focal adhesions. Both adipogenic differentiation and chondrogenic differentiation are encouraged when MSCs have a spherical morphology associated with a dispersed actin cytoskeleton with few focal adhesions. Different mechanical stimuli can be implemented to alter these cytoskeletal patterns and encourage MSC differentiation to the desired lineage.

AB Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare inherited connective tissue dysplasia characterized with skeletal fragility, recurrent fractures and bone deformity, predominantly caused by mutations in the genes COL1A1 or COL1A2 that encode the chains of type I collagen. In the present study, clinical manifestations and genetic variants were analysed from 187 Chinese OI patients, majority of whom are of southern Chinese origin. By targeted sequencing, 63 and 58 OI patients were found carrying mutations in COL1A1 and COL1A2 respectively, including 8 novel COL1A1 and 7 novel COL1A2 variants. We validated a novel splicing mutation in COL1A1. A diverse mutational and phenotypic spectrum was observed, coupling with the heterogeneity observed in the transcriptomic data derived from osteoblasts of six patients from our cohort. Missense mutations were significantly associated (chi(2) p = 0.0096) with a cluster of patients with more severe clinical phenotypes. Additionally, the severity of OI was more correlated with the quality of bones, rather than the bone mineral density. Bone density is most responsive to bisphosphonate treatment during the juvenile stage (10 15 years old). In contrast, height is not responsive to bisphosphonate treatment. Our findings expand the mutational spectrum of type I collagen genes and the genotype phenotype correlation in Chinese OI patients. The observation of effective bisphosphonate treatment in an age specific manner may help to improve OI patient management.

AB Bone fracture risk can increase through bone microstructural changes observed in bone pathologies, such as glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis. Resorption cavities present one of these microstructural aspects. We recently found that glucocorticoids (GCs) affect the shape of the resorption cavities. Specifically, we found that in the presence of GC osteoclasts (OCs) cultured on bone slices make more trenchlike cavities, compared to rather round cavities in the absence of GCs, while the total eroded surface remained constant. For this study, we hypothesized that trenchlike cavities affect bone strength differently compared to round cavities. To test this hypothesis, we cultured OCs on bone slices in the presence and absence of GC and quantified their dimensions. These data were used to model the effects of OC resorption cavities on bone mechanical properties using a validated beam shell finite element model of trabecular bone. We demonstrated that a change in the geometry of resorption cavities is sufficient to affect bone competence. After correcting for the increased EV/BV with GCs, the difference to the control condition was no longer significant, indicating that the GC induced increase in EV/BV, which is closely related to the shape of the cavities, highly determines the stiffness effect. The lumbar spine was the anatomic site most affected by the GC induced changes on the shape of the cavities. These findings might explain the clinical observation that the prevalence of vertebral fractures during GC treatment increases more than hip, forearm and other nonvertebral fractures.

TI Yunnan Baiyao Inhibits Periodontitis by Suppressing the Autophagic Flux
SO INTERNATIONAL DENTAL JOURNAL

AB Background: Yunnan Baiyao (YNBY), a traditional Chinese medicine, is renowned for its anti inflammatory properties. Recent studies have suggested that YNBY plays a significant role in inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and autophagy, which are essential processes in inflammation and bone resorption associated with periodontitis. However, the precise relationship between autophagy and the mechanism by which YNBY inhibits osteoclastogenesis remains unexplored.The primary objective of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effects of YNBY on the process of osteoclastogenesis and its potential in preventing inflammatory bone loss. Methods: The animals were subjected to sacrifice at intervals of 2, 4, and 6 weeks postintervention whilst under deep anaesthesia, and specimens were subsequently collected. The specimens were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, in addition to tartrateresistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and subsequently imaged employing a digital scanner. The confirmation of osteoclast (OC) differentiation and autophagic flux was achieved through various techniques, including western blotting, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), TRAP staining, pit formation assay, and immunofluorescence. Results: The microcomputed tomography images provided evidence of the effective inhibition of alveolar bone absorption at 2, 4, and 6 weeks following YNBY treatment. Additionally, the histomorphometric evaluations of tissue segments stained with HE and TRAP, which involved measuring the distance between the alveolar bone crest (ABC) and cementoenamel junction (CEJ) and quantifying TRAP positive OCs, yielded comparable results to those obtained through computed tomography analysis. YNBY treatment resulted in a decrease in the CEJ ABC distance and inhibition of OC differentiation. Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that the autophagy modulators rapamycin (RAP) and 3 methyladenine (3 MA) significantly affected OC differentiation and function. YNBY attenuated the impact of RAP on the differentiation of OCs, autophagy related factor activation, and bone resorption. Conclusions: We hypothesise that YNBY suppresses the differentiation of OC and bone resorption by blocking autophagy. This study reveals that targeting autophagy might be a new alternative treatment methodology for periodontitis treatment. (c) 2023 The Authors.

AB The pathophysiology of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated bone loss is complex and to date largely unknown. In this study, we investigated serum expression of microRNAS (miRNAs) linked to bone metabolism in HIV associated bone loss. This was a case control study. Thirty male individuals with HIV infection (HIV+) and osteoporosis/osteopenia (HIV+/OP+) (cases) and 30 age matched male HIV+ individuals with normal bone mass (HIV+/OP ) (controls) were included in the analysis. Thirty male individuals matched for age without HIV infection (HIV ), were also included as second controls. The selected panel of miRNAs was as follows: hsa miRNA 21 5p; hsa miRNA 23a 3p; hsa miRNA 24 2 5p; hsa miRNA 26a 5p; hsa miRNA 29a 3p; hsa miRNA 124 3p; hsa miRNA 33a 5p; and hsa miRNA 133a 3p. Within the cohort of HIV+ individuals, relative serum expression of miRNA 21 5p and miRNA 23a 3p was significantly lower (p < 0.001) while the expression of miRNA 24 2 5p was significantly higher (p = 0.030) in HIV+/OP+ compared to HIV+/OP . Expression of miRNA 21 5p demonstrated a sensitivity of 84.6% and a specificity of 66.7 in distinguishing HIV+/OP+ individuals. Expression of circulating miRNAs related to bone metabolism; miRNA 23a 3p, miRNA 24 2 5p, and miRNA 21 5p is significantly altered in HIV+OP+ individuals, in line with data on other causes of osteoporosis, suggesting a common pattern of circulating miRNAs independent of the underlying cause.

AB Background The protective effect of melatonin against bone metabolism imbalance in osteoporosis (OP) induced by drugs such as retinoic acid (RA) is unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the role of melatonin in bone destruction based on a mouse model. Methods RA induced OP model mice were established. To assess the effect of melatonin on these mice, micro CT was used to characterize the trabecular structure of normal mice and those treated with RA (model), RA + low dose melatonin (Mlt L), RA + high dose melatonin (Mlt H), and RA + alendronate sodium (positive control). The shape of the trabecular bone, the length and diameter of the femoral head and the height and diameter of vertebra(L1) of each group were also measured and the number of osteoclasts was determined by Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP) staining. Meanwhile, the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry assays. The differences between groups in terms of liver and kidney oxidation related indexes and serum and urinary indicators related to bone metabolism were also analyzed. Furthermore, qRT PCR and western blotting were used to evaluate the effect of melatonin on osteogenic and osteoclastic differentiation in MC3T3 E1 and RAW264.7 cells, respectively. Results RA induction led to a decrease in the amount and density of trabecular bone, a decrease in the length and diameter of the femur and height, diameter of the vertebra (L1), a decrease in bone mass and density and the expression of ALP, and an increase in the number of osteoclasts. Melatonin treatment alleviated these effects induced by RA, increasing the amount of trabecular bone in OP mice, improving the microstructure of the femur and vertebra(L1) and increasing bone mass bone density and the expression of ALP, as well as decreasing the number of osteoclasts. Additionally, blood and urinary bone metabolism related indicators showed that melatonin promoted bone formation and inhibited bone resorption. Determination of oxidant and antioxidant biomarkers in the livers and kidneys of the mice revealed that melatonin promoted the antioxidant level and suppressed the level of oxidant molecules in these organs. In vitro, RA promoted osteoclasts and inhibit osteogenesis by increasing oxidative stress levels in the RAW264.7 and MC3T3 E1 cells, but melatonin reversed this effect. Melatonin may, therefore, play a role in the ERK/SMAD and NF kappa B pathways. Conclusions Melatonin can alleviate bone loss in RA induced OP model mice, repair the trabecular microstructure, and promote bone formation. These effects may be related to reducing oxidation levels in vivo and vitro through the ERK/SMAD and NF kappa B pathways.

AB Cell cell and cell matrix interactions play a major role in tumor morphogenesis and cancer metastasis. Therefore, it is crucial to create a model with a biomimetic microenvironment that allows such interactions to fully represent the pathophysiology of a disease for an in vitro study. This is achievable by using three dimensional (3D) models instead of conventional two dimensional (2D) cultures with the aid of tissue engineering technology. We are now able to better address the complex intercellular interactions underlying prostate cancer (CaP) bone metastasis through such models. In this study, we assessed the interaction of CaP cells and human osteoblasts (hOBs) within a tissue engineered bone (TEB) construct. Consistent with other in vivo studies, our findings show that intercellular and CaP cell bone matrix interactions lead to elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases, steroidogenic enzymes and the CaP biomarker, prostate specific antigen (PSA); all associated with CaP metastasis. Hence, it highlights the physiological relevance of this model. We believe that this model will provide new insights for understanding of the previously poorly understood molecular mechanisms of bone metastasis, which will foster further translational studies, and ultimately offer a potential tool for drug screening.

AB In spite of the extensive potential of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in cell therapy, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate their therapeutic properties. We aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in controlling the transition between the resting and reparative phenotypes of hMSCs, hypothesizing that these miRNAs must be present in the undifferentiated cells and downregulated to allow initiation of distinct activation/differentiation programs. Differential miRNA expression analyses revealed that miR 335 is significantly downregulated upon hMSC differentiation. In addition, hMSCs derived from a variety of tissues express miR 335 at a higher level than human skin fibroblasts, and overexpression of miR 335 in hMSCs inhibited their proliferation and migration, as well as their osteogenic and adipogenic potential. Expression of miR 335 in hMSCs was upregulated by the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, a positive regulator of MSC self renewal, and downregulated by interferon gamma (IFN gamma), a pro inflammatory cytokine that has an important role in activating the immunomodulatory properties of hMSCs. Differential gene expression analyses, in combination with computational searches, defined a cluster of 62 putative target genes for miR 335 in hMSCs. Western blot and 3'UTR reporter assays confirmed RUNX2 as a direct target of miR 335 in hMSCs. These results strongly suggest that miR 335 downregulation is critical for the acquisition of reparative MSC phenotypes.

AB Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not curative due to the existence of cellular reservoirs of latent HIV 1 that persist during therapy. Current research efforts to cure HIV 1 infection include "shock and kill" strategies to disrupt latency using small molecules or latency reversing agents (LRAs) to induce expression of HIV 1 enabling cytotoxic immune cells to eliminate infected cells. The modest success of current LRAs urges the field to identify novel drugs with increased clinical efficacy. Aminobisphosphonates (N BPs) that include pamidronate, zoledronate, or alendronate, are the first line treatment of bone related diseases including osteoporosis and bone malignancies. Here, we show the use of N BPs as a novel class of LRA: we found in ex vivo assays using primary cells from ART suppressed people living with HIV 1 that N BPs induce HIV 1 from latency to levels that are comparable to the T cell activator phytohemagglutinin (PHA). RNA sequencing and mechanistic data suggested that reactivation may occur through activation of the activator protein 1 signaling pathway. Stored samples from a prior clinical trial aimed at analyzing the effect of alendronate on bone mineral density, provided further evidence of alendronate mediated latency reversal and activation of immune effector cells. Decay of the reservoir measured by IPDA was however not detected. Our results demonstrate the novel use of N BPs to reverse HIV 1 latency while inducing immune effector functions. This preliminary evidence merits further investigation in a controlled clinical setting possibly in combination with therapeutic vaccination.

AB Background Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common joint disorder, is characterized by a progressive degradation of articular cartilage. Increasing evidence suggests that OA is closely associated with cartilage pathologies including chondrocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis. Methods In this study, we showed that asiatic acid (AA) treatment reduced chondrocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis. First, the cytotoxicity of AA (0, 5, 10, and 20 mu M) to chondrocytes was evaluated, and 5 mu M was selected for subsequent experiments. Then, we detected the gene and protein level of chondrocyte hypertrophic markers including type X collagen (COL X), matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP 13), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2); chondrocyte fibrosis markers including type I collagen (COL Iota) and alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha SMA); and chondrogenic markers including SRY related HMG box 9 (SOX9), type II collagen (COL II), and aggrecan (ACAN). Further, we tested the mechanism of AA on inhibiting chondrocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis. Finally, we verified the results in an anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) rat OA model. Results We found that AA treatment inhibited the hypertrophic and fibrotic phenotype of chondrocytes, without affecting the chondrogenic phenotype. Moreover, we found that AA treatment activated AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibited phosphoinositide 3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway in vitro. The results in an ACLT rat OA model also indicated that AA significantly attenuated chondrocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis. Conclusion AA treatment could reduce hypertrophic and fibrotic differentiation and maintain the chondrogenic phenotype of articular chondrocytes by targeting the AMPK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Our study suggested that AA might be a prospective drug component that targets hypertrophic and fibrotic chondrocytes for OA treatment.

TI N acetylcysteine (NAC) differentially affects arterial medial

AB Arterial medial calcification (AMC) is the deposition of calcium phosphate in the arteries. AMC is widely thought to share similarities with physiological bone formation; however, emerging evidence suggests several key differences between these processes. N acetylcysteine (NAC) displays antioxidant properties and can generate hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and glutathione (GSH) from its deacetylation to l cysteine. This study found that NAC exerts divergent effects in vitro, increasing osteoblast differentiation and bone formation by up to 5.5 fold but reducing vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification and cell death by up to 80%. In vivo, NAC reduced AMC in a site specific manner by 25% but had no effect on the bone. The actions of l cysteine and H2S mimicked those of NAC; however, the effects of H2S were much less efficacious than NAC and l cysteine. Pharmacological inhibition of H2S generating enzymes did not alter the actions of NAC or l cysteine; endogenous production of H2S was also unaffected. In contrast, NAC and l cysteine increased GSH levels in calcifying VSMCs and osteoblasts by up to 3 fold. This suggests that the beneficial actions of NAC are likely to be mediated via the breakdown of l cysteine and the subsequent GSH generation. Together, these data show that while the molecular mechanisms driving the actions of NAC appear similar, the downstream effects on cell function differ significantly between osteoblasts and calcifying VSMCs. The ability of NAC to exert these differential actions further supports the notion that there are differences between the development of pathological AMC and physiological bone formation. NAC could represent a therapeutic option for treating AMC without exerting negative effects on bone.

AB Background Calcific aortic valve disease is associated with ageing and high mortality. However, no effective pharmacological treatment has been developed. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor are overexpressed in the calcified aortic valve tissue. However, the role of VEGF in calcific aortic valve disease pathogenesis and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
   Materials and methods Runt related transcription factor 2 expression and calcium related signalling were investigated in porcine valvular interstitial cells with or without human VEGF A recombinant protein (VEGF(165), 1 100 ng/mL) treatment and/or calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor (KN93, 10 mu mol/L) and inositol triphosphate receptor inhibitor (2 aminoethyldiphenyl borate, 30 mu mol/L) for 5 days.
   Results VEGF(165) treated cells had higher Runt related transcription factor 2 expression and CaMKII/ adenosine 3',5' monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) signalling activation than did control cells. KN93 reduced Runt related transcription factor 2 expression and CREB phosphorylation in VEGF(165) treated cells. The 2 aminoethyldiphenyl borate also reduced Runt related transcription factor 2 expression in VICs treated with VEGF(165).
   Conclusion VEGF upregulated Runt related transcription factor 2 expression in VICs by activating the IP3R/CaMKII/CREB signalling pathway.

AB The surface of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) was bifunctionalized with two ligands folic acid and a fluorochrome. In tandem, this combination should selectively target cancer cells and provide a means for imaging the nanoparticle. Modified bi functionalized HNTs (bi HNTs) were then doped with the anti cancer drug methotrexate. bi HNTs were characterized and subjected to in vitro tests to assess cellular growth and changes in cellular behavior in three cell lines colon cancer, osteosarcoma, and a pre osteoblast cell line (MC3T3 E1). Cell viability, proliferation, and cell uptake efficiency were assessed. The bi HNTs showed cytocompatibility at a wide range of concentrations. Compared with regular sized HNTs, reduced HNTs (similar to 6 microns) were taken up by cells in more significant amounts, but increased cytotoxicity lead to apoptosis. Multi photon images confirmed the intracellular location of bi HNTs, and the method of cell entry was mainly through caveolae mediated endocytosis. The bi HNTs showed a high drug loading efficiency with methotrexate and a prolonged period of release. Most importantly, bi HNTs were designed as a drug carrier to target cancer cells specifically, and imaging data shows that non cancerous cells were unaffected after exposure to MTX doped bi HNTs. All data provide support for our nanoparticle design as a mechanism to selectively target cancer cells and significantly reduce the side effects caused by off targeting of anti cancer drugs.

TI Price regulation, new entry, and information shock on pharmaceutical
   market in Taiwan: a nationwide data based study from 2001 to 2004
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English

AB Background: Using non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as a case, we used Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) database, to empirically explore the association between policy interventions (price regulation, new drug entry, and an information shock) and drug expenditures, utilization, and market structure between 2001 and 2004.
   Methods: All NSAIDs prescribed in ambulatory visits in the NHI system during our study period were included and aggregated quarterly. Segmented regression analysis for interrupted time series was used to examine the associations between two price regulations, two new drug entries (cyclooxygennase 2 inhibitors) and the rofecoxib safety signal and expenditures and utilization of all NSAIDs. Herfindahl index (HHI) was applied to further examine the association between these interventions and market structure of NSAIDs.
   Results: New entry was the only variable that was significantly correlated with changes of expenditures (positive change, p = 0.02) and market structure of the NSAIDs market in the NHI system. The correlation between price regulation (first price regulation, p = 0.62; second price regulation, p = 0.26) and information shock (p = 0.31) and drug expenditure were not statistically significant. There was no significant change in the prescribing volume of NSAIDs per rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or osteoarthritis (OA) ambulatory visit during the observational period. The market share of NSAIDs had also been largely substituted by these new drugs up to 50%, in a three year period and resulted in a more concentrated market structure (HHI 0.17).
   Conclusions: Our empirical study found that new drug entry was the main driving force behind escalating drug spending, especially by altering the market share.

AB Context: Anorexia nervosa is complicated by severe bone loss and clinical fractures. Mechanisms underlying bone loss in adults with anorexia nervosa include increased bone resorption and decreased formation. Estrogen administration has not been shown to prevent bone loss in this population, and to date, there are no approved, effective therapies for this comorbidity.
   Objective: To determine whether antiresorptive therapy with a bisphosphonate alone or in combination with low dose transdermal testosterone replacement would increase bone mineral density (BMD) in women with anorexia nervosa.
   Design and Setting: We conducted a 12 month, randomized, placebo controlled study at a clinical research center.
   Study Participants: Participants included 77 ambulatory women with anorexia nervosa.
   Intervention: Subjects were randomized to risedronate 35 mg weekly, low dose transdermal testosterone replacement therapy, combination therapy or double placebo.
   Main Outcome Measures: BMD at the spine (primary endpoint), hip, and radius and body composition were measured by dual energy x ray absorptiometry.
   Results: Risedronate increased posteroanterior spine BMD 3%, lateral spine BMD 4%, and hip BMD 2% in women with anorexia nervosa compared with placebo in a 12 month clinical trial. Testosterone administration did not improve BMD but increased lean body mass. There were few side effects associated with either therapy.
   Conclusions: Risedronate administration for 1 yr increased spinal BMD, the primary site of bone loss in women with anorexia nervosa. Low dose testosterone did not change BMD but increased lean body mass. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 96: 2081 2088, 2011)

AB Melanoma is commonly associated with multi organ metastasis, and bone is a frequent metastatic site for melanoma. However, the mechanism responsible for such melanoma induced bone metastasis is still poorly understood. In the present study, the intracardiac inoculation of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) producing human melanoma derived cells (SEKI) developed osteolytic bone destruction in male BALB/cA nu/nu nude mice. To elucidate the role of LIF in melanoma induced osteolysis, cells were prepared in which the expression of LIF was reduced using a siRNA technique from the parent SEKI cells. Osteoclastogenesis was induced in the co culture of LIF and/or SEKI cells with osteoblastic stromal cells in vitro, whereas the LIF reduced SEKI cells did not induce osteoclastogenesis. The intracardiac inoculation of LIF reduced SEKI cells resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence and number of bone metastasis in comparison to those in the mice inoculated with the parent SEKI cells. The expression of LIF was found in seven of nine human melanoma derived cell lines, suggesting that LIF expression is a universal event in melanoma. These findings suggest that a potential role for LIF in the melanoma induced bone metastasis possibly through the stimulation of osteoclastogenesis. LIF might therefore be a potentially effective drug target in the treatment of bone metastasis in melanoma.

AB Bone injury repair has always been a tricky problem in clinic, the recent emergence of bone tissue engineering provides a new direction for the repair of bone injury. However, some bone tissue processes fail to achieve satisfactory results mainly due to insufficient vascularization or cellular immune rejection. Exosomes with the ability of vesicle mediated intercellular signal transmission have gained worldwide attention and can achieve cellfree therapy. Exosomes are small vesicles that are secreted by cells, which contain genetic material, lipids, proteins and other substances. It has been found to play the function of material exchange between cells. It is widely used in bone tissue engineering to achieve cell free therapy because it not only does not produce some immune rejection like cells, but also can play a cell like function. Exosomes from different sources can bind to scaffolds in various ways and affect osteoblast, angioblast, and macrophage polarization in vivo to promote bone regeneration. This article reviews the recent research progress of exosome loaded tissue engineering, focusing on the mechanism of exosomes from different sources and the application of exosome loaded scaffolds in promoting bone regeneration. Finally, the existing deficiencies and challenges, future development directions and prospects are summarized.

AB Background: Hwangryun haedok tang (HRT) is traditional herbal medicine used to treat inflammatory related diseases in Asia. However, its effect on osteoclastogenesis and bone loss is still unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effect of HRT and its fermented product (fHRT) on the receptor activator for the nuclear factor kappa B ligand induced osteoclastogenesis using murine bone marrow derived macrophages and postmenopausal bone loss using an ovariectomy (OVX) rat model.
   Methods: Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining was employed to evaluate osteoclast formation. mRNA level of transcription factor and protein levels of signaling molecules were determined by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, respectively. Effect of HRT or fHRT on OVX induced bone loss was evaluated using OVX rats orally administered HRT, or fHRT with 300 mg/kg for 12 weeks. Micro CT analysis of femora was performed to analyze bone parameter.
   Results: HRT or fHRT treatment significantly decreased TRAP activity and the number of TRAP positive multinuclear cells on osteoclastogenesis. Interestingly, these inhibitory effects of HRT were enhanced by fermentation. Furthermore, fHRT significantly inhibited mRNA and protein expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1, which leads to down regulation of NFATc1 regulated mRNA expressions such as TRAP, the d2 isoform of vacuolar ATPase V(0) domain, and cathepsin K. Administration of fHRT significantly inhibited the decrease of bone mineral density, and improved bone parameter of femora more than that of HRT and vehicle in OVX rats.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated that lactic bacterial fermentation fortifies the inhibitory effect of HRT on osteoclastogenesis and bone loss. These results suggest that fermented HRT might have the beneficial potential on osteoporosis by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis.

AB By using an experimental model of dexamethasone induced osteoporosis we investigated the effects of different therapeutic schemes combining sodium alendronate (SA) and simvastatin on bone mineral and protein composition, microstructural and mechanical remodeling. Wistar rats were randomized into eight groups: G1: non osteoporotic; G2: osteoporotic; G3, G4, and G5: osteoporotic+SA (0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg/kg, respectively); G6, G7, and G8: osteoporotic+SA (0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg/kg, respectively)+simvastatin (0.4, 0.6, and 1 mg/kg, respectively). Osteoporosis was induced by dexamethasone (7 mg/kg, i.m.) once a week for 5 weeks. All treatments were administered for 8 weeks. Dexamethasone increased serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, and urea, especially in non treated animals, which showed severe osteoporosis. Dexamethasone also induced bone microstructural fragility and reduced mechanical resistance, which were associated with a marked depletion in mineral mass, collagenous and non collagenous protein levels in cortical and cancellous bone. Although SA has attenuated osteoporosis severity, the effectiveness of drug therapy was enhanced combining alendronate and simvastatin. The restoration in serum parameters, organic and inorganic bone mass, and mechanical behavior showed a dose dependent effect that was potentially related to the complementary mechanisms by which each drug acts to induce bone anabolism, accelerating tissue repair.

AB Osteoporosis is a reduction in skeletal mass due to an imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption. Many researchers have tried to develop adjuvants as specific suppressors of bone resorption and stimulators of bone formation for therapeutic purposes in patients with osteoporosis. Therefore, specific stimulators on bone formation are one of therapeutic significance in the treatment of osteoporosis. Until now, the regulation of bone generation has been the focus of bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP 7) investigation from mature form. However, new peptides from immature form which has osteogenic activity has not been reported and developments of these proteins are still remained. In this study, we found a new peptide sequence, called bone forming peptide 1 (BFP 1) and have more high activities of osteogenic differentiation compared with BMP 7. BFP 1 treated multipotent bone marrow stromal stem cells (MBSCs) induced the expression levels and activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Moreover, BFP 1 enhanced the levels of CD44, CD47 and CD51 expression as well as increased Ca2+ content in MBSCs. In current study, radiography at 8 weeks revealed that BFP 1 pretreated MBSC transplanted animals had strongly increased bone formation compared to that in the BMP 7 pretreated MBSC transplanted animals. Our finding indicates a new insight into peptides from the immature region of BMP 7 can also be useful in the development of adjuvant therapies for bone related diseases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Effects of selective testosterone and estradiol withdrawal on skeletal
   sensitivity to parathyroid hormone in men

AB Context: Gonadal steroid withdrawal increases bone turnover and causes bone loss in men, but the underlying mechanisms have not been defined. We previously reported that gonadal steroid deprivation increases the skeletal sensitivity to the bone resorbing properties of PTH infusion in men, but it is not known whether this effect is mediated by the absence of androgens, estrogens, or both.
   Objective: The objective of the study was to determine the selective effects of testosterone and estradiol withdrawal on the skeletal sensitivity to PTH infusion in healthy adult men.
   Design and Setting: We randomly assigned 58 healthy men between the ages of 20 and 45 yr to receive treatment with combinations of a GnRH analog, an aromatase inhibitor, and hormone add back therapy to produce the following treatment groups: group 1 (testosterone and estradiol deficient, n = 16); group 2 (testosterone sufficient but estradiol deficient, n = 12); group 3 (testosterone deficient but estradiol sufficient, n = 14); and group 4 (testosterone and estradiol sufficient, n = 16). Twenty four hour PTH infusions were performed at baseline and after 6 wk of therapy. Serum N telopeptide (NTX), C telopeptide (CTX), osteocalcin (OC), and amino terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (P1NP) were measured every 6 h during the PTH infusions.
   Results: Serum testosterone levels fell into the castrate range in groups 1 and 3, whereas estradiol levels were similarly reduced in groups 1 and 2. Gonadal steroid levels in the replaced groups were unchanged from baseline. Serum NTX levels measured before PTH infusion did not change in group 4 (+T, +E) but increased significantly in all other groups. A similar pattern was observed in serum CTX, although the increase in group 2 (+T, +E) was not significant (P = 0.12). Preinfusion concentrations of both OC and P1NP fell in most groups, but these changes were significant in group 2 (+T, +E) for both OC and P1NP and group 4 (+T, +E) for P1NP only. Serum NTX and CTX increased during PTH infusions in all groups at all time points (P < 0.001). In the eugonadal group (group 4 +T+E), the increase in NTX was the same at wk 0 and 6, whereas in all the other groups, the PTH induced increase in serum NTX was significantly greater at wk, 6 compared with wk 0. The same pattern emerged for CTX, although the difference in group 3 (+T,  E) was not significant (P = 0.12). Serum OC and P1NP levels fell during PTH infusions in all groups and at all time points (P < 0.001), but no significant differences were observed between wk 0 and 6 in any group.
   Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the selective suppression of testosterone, estradiol, or both hormones increases the skeletal responsiveness to the bone resorbing effects of PTH in men. These findings underscore the importance of both androgens and estrogens in male skeletal homeostasis and suggest that changes in skeletal sensitivity to PTH may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hypogonadal bone loss in men.

AB Recently, natural ingredients have focused on the inhibition of bacteria induced alveolar bone resorption in orthodontic treatment. Jixueteng (Jix), a Chinese traditional medicine, contains several kinds of flavonoids given their biological properties. We evaluated the effects of Jix on experimental periodontitis during orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) in rats. To this end, 9 week old male Wistar rats, which were equipped with orthodontic appliance, were orally infected with Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), while Jix was administered in their drinking water. A total of 28 days after the beginning of OTM, alveolar bone resorption on the right side of the upper jaws was scanned with micro computed tomography. These were also used as histological specimens and underwent tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. TRAP positive multinucleated cells were counted as osteoclasts. As a result, the distance of tooth movement in the OTM and Pg infection with Jix administration (OTM + Pg + Jix) group was the same as that of the sham infected group. The amount of bone resorption and number of osteoclasts in the OTM + Pg + Jix group was more significantly decreased than that in the OTM and Pg infected group (P < 0.05). Hence, Jix had little effect on OTM and inhibited Pg induced alveolar bone destruction. We suggested that the administration of Jix can support tooth movement and contribute to the prevention of periodontitis during orthodontic treatment.

AB Treatment for RA has changed profoundly over the past 25 years, evolving from a strategy of providing symptomatic relief, to implementation of therapeutic regimens that impact disease activity and ultimately have been shown to slow or arrest structural joint damage. Drug therapy for RA has evolved from salicylates, to NSAIDs, CSs, DMARDs, MTX, and finally to biologic response modifiers. MTX has become the initial drug of choice in most patients with RA, and some do well on MTX monotherapy without the addition of other agents. Combination regimens including MTX and other conventional DMARDs may be an effective early approach to treatment of RA. The biologic response modifiers (biologics) became available in the late 1990s, based on our understanding of the molecular mediators of synovial inflammation in RA. The first biologics inhibited TNF alpha, a cytokine active in host defences against some infections and malignancies, but which also promotes inflammation and bone erosion. Inhibitors of TNF alpha are mostly given with MTX, although some can be given as monotherapy. Studies consistently show that combination MTX + TNF alpha inhibitor therapy leads to better outcomes than with either agent alone. Tight control strategies, employing objective measures, also lead to improved outcomes. When patients fail treatment with one or more TNF alpha inhibitor + MTX, a number of other possible alternatives may be tried, including treatment with biologics having other mechanisms, such as antibodies to certain ILs, other cytokines and inflammatory mediators. Current therapy for RA is such that progression from symptom onset to significant disability is now no longer inevitable, and RA patients can anticipate comfortable and productive lives on medical therapy.

AB Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is common in the elderly population, but pharmacological interventions for managing valvular calcification are unavailable. Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP 2) induce pro osteogenic activation of human aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) that play an important role in valvular calcification. However, the molecular mechanism underlying pro osteogenic activation in AVICs is incompletely understood. Here, we investigated an epigenetic regulatory mechanism in human AVIC pro osteogenic activation induced by TGF beta 1 and BMP 2. Microarray and real time PCR analyses revealed that microRNA (miR) 486 up regulation and miR 204 down regulation were characteristic changes in TGF beta 1  and BMP 2 stimulated normal AVICs and in AVICs from calcified valves. Both TGF beta 1 and BMP 2 down regulated miR 204 through Smad pathways. Interestingly, an miR 486 antagomir diminished the effect of TGF beta 1 and BMP 2 on miR 204 levels and calcium deposit formation. Furthermore, the miR 486 antagomir increased the expression of Smurf2, a Smad inhibitor, in the presence or absence of TGF beta 1 or BMP 2 stimulation, whereas a miR 486 mimic reduced Smurf2 expression. Smurf2 knockdown augmented TGF beta 1  or BMP 2 induced miR 204 down regulation and resulted in increased expression of the osteoblastic biomarkers Osx and Runx2. In summary, we found that TGF beta 1 and BMP 2 up regulate miR 486 and down regulate miR 204 in human AVICs to promote pro osteogenic activity and that miR 486 inhibits Smurf2 expression to augment the miR 204 down regulation. We conclude that the miR 486 Smurf2 Smad loop plays an important role in regulating AVIC pro osteogenic activation in response to TGF beta 1 or BMP 2. Targeting this regulatory loop may have therapeutic potential for suppressing aortic valve calcification.

AB The differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into unwanted lineages can generate potential problems in clinical trials. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms, involved in this process, would help prevent unexpected complications. Regulation of gene expression, at the posttranscriptional level, is a new approach in cell therapies. PUMILIO is a conserved posttranscriptional regulator. However, the underlying mechanisms of PUMILIO, in vertebrate stem cells, remain elusive. Here, we show that depletion of PUMILIO2 (PUM2) blocks MSC adipogenesis and enhances osteogenesis. We also demonstrate that PUM2 works as a negative regulator on the 3 ' untranslated regions of JAK2 and RUNX2 via direct binding. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene silencing of Pum2 inhibited lipid accumulation and induced excessive bone formation in zebrafish larvae. Our findings reveal novel roles of PUM2 in MSCs and provide potential therapeutic targets for related diseases.

AB Introduction: Approximately 30% of patients with renal cell cancer (RCC) develop bone metastasis causing skeletal related events (SRE): pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, surgery to bone and radiotherapy. Zoledronic acid demonstrated significant clinical benefit in RCC patients in a retrospective analysis. Primary objective of this prospective study was the proportion of patients experiencing >= 1 SRE during 12 months of zoledronic acid treatment and to verify the retrospective data.
   Materials and methods: Fifty patients with histologically confirmed RCC and evidence of >= 1 cancer related bone lesion and <= 3 prior bisphosphonate applications were enrolled in 19 German centers between 2004 and 2007. The patients received 4 mg zoledronic acid every 3 weeks for 12 months followed by a follow up period for overall survival of 12 months. Bone lesions were diagnosed by bone scan or MRI quickscan. Greater and equal to 1 lesion had to be confirmed by x ray, CT or MRI scan. Additional bone scans were performed after completion of study treatment and if clinically indicated. In case of suspicion or evidence of a SRE it had to be confirmed radiologically.
   Results: In total, 49 of the 50 enrolled patients were treated. Only 11 of them (22.4%) experienced any SRE until month 12. Patients with > 6 lesions and higher baseline MSKCC (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) score had a higher risk for SREs. Zoledronic acid was generally well tolerated and its known safety profile was affirmed.
   Conclusions: This prospective study confirms the results of prior data about the efficacy of zoledronic acid in patients with metastatic (m)RCC, supporting its beneficial use in these patients.

AB MicroRNAs aberrantly express in many human diseases including some metabolic bone disorders. They have been found to be associated with osteoclast differentiation and function, which makes them attractive candidates for the therapy of bone. However, the potential clinical application of microRNAs in therapeutics rests heavily upon our in depth understanding of microRNAs and their targets. To identify potential microRNA target pairs associated with osteopetrosis, we performed a system approach including deep sequencing, iTRAQ quantitative proteomics, and bioinformatics in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) taken from patients with osteopetrosis and health donors. Notably, 123 differently expressed microRNAs, 173 differently expressed proteins, and 117 computationally predicted microRNA target pairs with reciprocally expressed level in PBMCs were found in the two sample groups. Functional annotation identified that the microRNA target pairs were involved in cell growth, differentiation, cellular signaling network, and the network highlighted the microRNA target pair of has miR 320a and ADP ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) potentially associated with CLCN7 mutations in osteopetrosis. The pair of has miR 320a and Arf1 was further verified by real time PCR, western blot, and the interaction between has miR 320a and its targeted sequence on the Arf1 mRNAs was confirmed by luciferase assay. Collectively, the present study established a new system approach for the investigation of microRNAs, and the microRNA target pairs, particular has miR 320a and Arf1, may have important roles in osteopetrosis.

TI Hyperoside, a Flavonoid Compound, Inhibits Proliferation and Stimulates
   Osteogenic Differentiation of Human Osteosarcoma Cells
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID CANCER STEM CELLS; APOPTOSIS; THERAPY; HYPERIN; BETA
AB Osteosarcoma, one of the most common malignant bone tumours, is generally considered a differentiation disease caused by genetic and epigenetic disruptions in the terminal differentiation of osteoblasts. Novel therapies based on the non cytotoxic induction of cell differentiation responsive pathways could represent a significant advance in treating osteosarcoma; however, effective pharmaceuticals to induce differentiation are lacking. In the present study, we investigated the effect of hyperoside, a flavonoid compound, on the osteoblastic differentiation of U2OS and MG63 osteosarcoma cells in vitro. Our results demonstrated that hyperoside inhibits the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells by inducing G(0)/G(1) arrest in the cell cycle, without causing obvious cell death. Cell migration assay further suggested that hyperoside could inhibit the invasion potential of osteosarcoma cells. Additionally, osteopontin and runt related transcription factor 2 protein levels and osteocalcin activation were upregulated dramatically in hyperoside treated osteosarcoma cells, suggesting that hyperoside may stimulates osteoblastic differentiation in osteosarcoma cells. This differentiation was accompanied by the activation of transforming growth factor (TGF) beta and bone morphogenetic protein 2, suggesting that the hyperoside induced differentiation involves the TGF beta signalling pathway. To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the differentiation effect of hyperoside in osteosarcoma cells and assess the possible potential for hyperoside treatment as a future therapeutic approach for osteosarcoma differentiation therapy.

AB Bone metastasis is the primary cause of death among patients with advanced prostate cancer (PCa). PCa tends to spread to bones and acquire the bone like phenotype, causing osteoblastic bone metastasis. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for this condition. However, melatonin, which regulates our circadian rhythm, has been found to have anti tumor properties. It has yet to be established whether it is effective in treating osteoblastic PCa metastasis. Our findings show that melatonin inhibits the production of endothelin 1 (ET 1) in osteoblastic PCa cells, suppressing osteoblast differentiation. Clinical results indicate that bone metastatic PCa patients have higher levels of ET 1 compared to nonmetastatic PCa patients. Furthermore, melatonin induced miR let 7f 5p inhibits ET 1 promoted osteoblast differentiation in osteoblastic PCa. Melatonin also suppresses the property of osteomimicry in osteoblastic PCa cells. Importantly, in the intratibia injection PCa metastasis model, melatonin decreased osteoblastic PCa tumor growth, inhibiting ET 1 production and osteoblast differentiation in vivo. Taken together, melatonin inhibits osteoblastic PCa regulated osteoblastogenesis by reducing ET 1 production through upregulation of miR let 7f 5p, while suppressing the property of osteomimicry in osteoblastic PCa. Melatonin therapy could be a promising approach to treating bone metastasis in osteoblastic PCa.

AB Background/Aims: Osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) plays a crucial role in bone regeneration and bone reparation. This complex process is regulated precisely and firmly by specific factors. Recent studies have demonstrated that miR 125b regulates osteogenic differentiation, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms of this regulation. Furthermore, how miR 125b regulates the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs still needs elucidation. Methods: In the present study, human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) were isolated and induced to osteoblasts with miR 125b inhibition or overexpression. qRT PCR and western blot analysis were used to detect the expression of osteogenic marker genes and proteins. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Alizarin Red (ARS) staining were performed to evaluate the osteoblast phenotype. TargetScan, PicTar and miRanda database were used to predict the target gene of miR 125b. Dual luciferase reporter assay and RNA interference were performed to verify the target gene. Micro CT imaging and histochemical staining were used to investigate the bone defect repair capacity of miR 125b in vivo. Results: We observed that miR 125b was expressed at a low level during the osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. Then, we found that osteogenic marker genes were negatively regulated by miR 125b during the course of osteogenic differentiation, suggesting that miR125b down regulation plays an important role in the process of osteogenic differentiation. Bioinformatics approaches using miRNA target prediction algorithms indicated that the bone morphogenetic protein type Ib receptor (BMPR1b) is a potential target of miR 125b. The results of the dual luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR 125b binds to the 3'UTR of the BMPR1b gene. We observed that knockdown of BMPR1b by siRNA inhibited the osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. Furthermore, by co transfecting cells with an miR 125b inhibitor and si BMPR1b, we found that the osteogenic capacity of the cells transfected with miR 125b inhibitor was blocked upon knockdown of BMPR1b. In vivo, demineralized bone matrix (DBM) was composited with hBMSCs as a scaffold to repair segmental femoral defects. By inhibiting the expression of miR 125b, hBMSCs showed a better capacity to repair bone defects. Conclusions: Taken together, our study demonstrated that miR 125b regulated the osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs by targeting BMPR1b and that inhibiting miR 125b expression could enhance the capacity of bone defect repair in vivo.

AB Dexamethasone (dexa) is commonly used to stimulate osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) in vitro. However, it is paradoxical that glucocorticoids (GCs) such as dexa lead to bone loss and increased fracture risk in patients undergoing glucocorticoid therapy, causing glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis (GIOP). In a recent publication, we demonstrated that osteogenic differentiation of progenitor cells isolated from jaw periosteal tissue (JPCs) does not depend on dexa, if the medium is supplemented with human platelet lysate (hPL) instead of fetal bovine serum (FBS). This allows the in vitro conditions to be much closer to the natural situation in vivo and enables us to compare osteogenic differentiation with and without dexa. In the present study, we demonstrate that the absence of dexa did not reduce mineralization capacity, but instead slightly improved the osteogenic differentiation of jaw periosteal cells. On the other hand, we show that dexa supplementation strongly alters the gene expression, extracellular matrix (ECM), and cellular communication of jaw periosteal cells. The secretome of periosteal cells previously treated with an osteogenic medium with and without dexa was used to investigate the changes in paracrine secretion caused by dexa. Dexa altered the secretion of several cytokines by jaw periosteal cells and strongly induced osteoclast differentiation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This study demonstrates how dexa supplementation can influence the outcome of in vitro studies and highlights a possible role of periosteal cells in the pathogenesis of glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis. The methods used here can serve as a model for studying bone formation, fracture healing, and various pathological conditions such as (glucocorticoid induced) osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, bone cancer, and others, in which the interactions of osteoblasts with surrounding cells play a key role.

AB Background: The withdrawal of rofecoxib has highlighted concerns regarding the safety of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX 2) inhibitors. In some patients COX 2 inhibitors may be safer than nonselective nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); however, the public health benefit of COX 2 inhibitors depends on their use in patients at higher than normal risk from NSAIDs. We examined trends in COX 2 inhibitor use based on risk for adverse events from NSAIDs.
   Methods: We analyzed data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (1999 2002) and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (19992001), nationally representative surveys of community and hospital based outpatient practices. The main outcome measure was the proportion of patient visits in which COX 2 inhibitors were prescribed, stratified by risk of adverse gastrointestinal (GI) events from NSAIDs.
   Results: Of the visits in which either a COX 2 inhibitor or NSAID was prescribed., the frequency of COX 2 inhibitor use increased from 35% (1999) to 55% (2000 to 61% (2001 and 2002). Among patients with the lowest risk for adverse events from NSAIDs, the proportion receiving a COX 2 inhibitor increased from 12% in 1999 to 35% in 2002. Overall, increases in COX 2 inhibitor use among patients in whom NSAIDs could be used accounted for more than 63% of the growth in COX 2 inhibitor use during the period examined.
   Conclusions: Marked increases in COX 2 inhibitor use have occurred since their release, primarily among patients at low risk for adverse events from NSAIDs. These findings demonstrate the challenge of limiting innovative therapies to the settings in which they are initially targeted and maximally beneficial.

AB Inflammation and cancer, two therapeutic areas historically addressed by separate drug discovery efforts, are now coupled in treatment approaches by a growing understanding of the dynamic molecular dialogues between immune and cancer cells. Agents that target specific compartments of the immune system, therefore, not only bring new disease modifying modalities to inflammatory diseases, but also offer a new avenue to cancer therapy by disrupting immune components of the microenvironment that foster tumor growth, progression, immune evasion, and treatment resistance. McDonough feline sarcoma viral (v fms) oncogene homolog (FMS) and v kit Hardy Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KIT) are two hematopoietic cell surface receptors that regulate the development and function of macrophages and mast cells, respectively. We disclose a highly specific dual FMS and KIT kinase inhibitor developed from a multifaceted chemical scaffold. As expected, this inhibitor blocks the activation of macrophages, osteoclasts, and mast cells controlled by these two receptors. More importantly, the dual FMS and KIT inhibition profile has translated into a combination of benefits in preclinical disease models of inflammation and cancer.

AB Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising candidates for tissue regeneration and disease treatment. However, long term in vitro culture results in loss of MSC stemness. The inflammation that occurs at stem cell transplant sites (such as that resulting from TNF alpha) is a contributing factor for stem cell treatment failure. Currently, there is little evidence regarding the protective role of melatonin with regard to the negative effects of TNF alpha on the stemness of MSCs. In this study, we report a melatonin based method to reduce the inflammatory effects on the stemness of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs). The results of colony formation assays, Alizarin red staining, western blotting, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions suggest that melatonin can reverse the inflammatory damage caused by TNF alpha treatment in the third, seventh, and tenth generations of primary BMMSCs (vs. control and the TNF alpha treated group). Meanwhile, a detailed analysis of the molecular mechanisms showed that the melatonin receptor and YAP signaling pathway are closely related to the role that melatonin plays in negative inflammatory effects against BMMSCs. In addition, in vivo experiments showed that melatonin could reverse the damage caused by TNF alpha on bone regeneration by BMMSCs in nude mice. Overall, our results suggest that melatonin can reverse the loss of stemness caused by inflammatory factor TNF alpha in BMMSCs. Our results also provide a practical strategy for the application of BMMSCs in tissue engineering and cell therapy.

AB Abnormal T cell immune responses induce aberrant expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF alpha, leading to osteoclastmediated bone erosion and osteoporosis in autclimmune arthritis. However, the mechanism underlying enhanced osteoclastogenesis in arthritis is not completely understood. Here we show that TNF a contributes to inflammatory bone loss by enhancing the osteoclastogenic potential of osteoclast precursor cells through inducing paired Ig hke receptor A (PIR A), a costimulatory receptor for receptor activator of NF kappa B (RANK). In fact, bone erosion and osteoporosis, but not inflammation, caused by aberrant TNF a expression were ameliorated in mice deficient in Fc receptor common gamma subunit or beta(2) microglobulin, in which the expression of PIR As and PIR A figands is impaired, respectively. These results establish the pathological role of costimulatory receptors for RANK in bone loss in arthritis and may provide a molecular basis for the future therapy of inflammatory diseases.

AB Despite the advancements in bone transplantation operations, inflammation is still a serious problem that threatens human health at the post implantation period. Conventional antibiotic therapy methods may lead to some side effects such as ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, especially when applied in high doses. Therefore, local drug delivery systems play a vital role in bone disorders due to the elimination of the disadvantages introduced by conventional methods. In the presented study, it was aimed to develop Vancomycin (VC) and Gentamicin (GC) loaded chitosan montmorillonite nanoclay composites (CS/MMT) to provide required antibiotic doses to combat post implantation infection. CS/MMT nanocomposite formation was supplied by microfluidizer homogenization and spherical drug carrier nanoparticles were obtained by electrospraying technique. Three factors; voltage, distance and flowrate were varied to fabricate spherical nanoparticles with uniform size. Emprical model was developed to predict nanosphere size by altering process variables. Nanospheres were characterized in terms of morphology, hydrodynamic size, zeta potential, drug encapsulation efficiency and release profile. Drug loaded nanospheres have been successfully produced with a size range of 180 350 nm. Nanocomposite drug carriers showed high encapsulation efficiency (80% 95%) and prolonged release period when compared to bare chitosan nanospheres. The drug release from nanocomposite carriers was monitored by diffusion mechanism up to 30 d. The in vitro release medium of nanospheres showed strong antimicrobial activity against gram positive S. aureus and gram negative E. coli bacteria. Furthermore, it was found that the nanospheres did not show any cytotoxic effect to fibroblast (NIH/3T3) and osteoblast (SaOS 2) cell lines. The results demonstrated that the prepared composite nanospheres can be a promising option for bone infection prevention at the post implantation period.

AB Background: Extracts from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge have been used in traditional Asian medicine to treat coronary heart disease, chronic renal failure, atherosclerosis, myocardial infraction, angina pectoris, myocardial ischemia, dysmenorrheal, neurasthenic insomnia, liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. The aim of the study was to investigate the antiRANK signal effect of the combination of S. miltiorrhiza Bunge (SME) and liquefied calcium (LCa) supplement with ovariectomized (OVX SML) mice, a osteoporosis animal model. Results were compared to 17 beta estradiol (E 2) treatment.
   Methods: A total of 70 female ICR strain mice (7 weeks) were randomly divided into 10 groups with 7 mice in each group as follows: (1) sham operated control mice (sham) received daily oral phosphate buffered saline (PBS) of equal volumes through oral administration. (2) OVX mice received a daily oral administration of PBS (OVX). (3) OVX mice treated daily with 50 mg/kg b.w./day of SME (4) with 100 mg/kg b.w./day of SME or (5) with 200 mg/kg b.w./day of SME via oral administration. (6) OVX mice treated daily with 50 mg/kg b.w./day of SML (7) with 100 mg/kg b.w./day of SML or (8) with 200 mg/kg b.w./day of SML via oral administration. (9) OVX mice treated daily with 10 ml/kg b.w./day of LCa (10) OVX mice received i.p. injections of 17 beta estradiol (E 2) (0.1 mg/kg b.w./day) three times per week for 12 weeks.
   Results: micro CT analysis revealed that oral administration of SML inhibited tibial bone loss, sustained trabecular bone state, and ameliorated bone biochemical markers. In addition, SML administration compared to SEM and LCa reduced serum levels of RANKL, osteocalcin and BALP through increased serum levels of OPG and E2 in OVX mice. SML also had more beneficial effects on protection of estrogen dependent bone loss through blocking expression of TRAF6 and NFTAc1 and produces cathepsin K and calcitonin receptor to develop osteoclast differentiation.
   Conclusion: These data suggest that S. miltiorrhiza Bunge combined with liquefied calcium supplement has an inhibitory activity in OVX mice. This result implies the possibility of a pharmacological intervention specifically directed toward a disease such as osteoporosis where decreased bone strength increases the risk of a broken bone.

AB Dental caries is a slowly progressive infectious disease with high risks. In response to dental caries stimuli, the tertiary dentin might be formed, protecting the dental pulp. Tertiary dentinogenesis contributes greatly to the treatment of carious lesions as well as the preservation and restoration of entire tooth function. A number of studies have found that application of exogenous growth factors such as transforming growth factors and bone morphogenetic proteins on unexposed pulps are able to signal tertiary dentinogenesis. Since precise mechanism of tertiary dentinogenesis is still not clear, more potential signaling factors might contribute to this process. Dentinogenesis shares many similarities with osteogenesis. The factors involved in osteogenesis and bone repair such as bone morphogenetic proteins 2, 7 and core binding factor alpha 1 play important roles in dentinogenesis. LIM mineralization protein 1 is a critical positive regulator of osteoblast differentiation, bone formation and repair. It is logical to postulate that LIM mineralization protein 1 might be involved in odontoblast differentiation and dentin formation both in normal and in pathological conditions. Application of LIM mineralization protein 1 might be a promising approach for inducing tertiary dentinogenesis in dental caries treatment.

AB In preclinical studies, human adipose stem cells (ASCs) have been shown to have therapeutic applicability, but standard expansion methods for clinical applications remain yet to be established. ASCs are typically expanded in the medium containing fetal bovine serum (FBS). However, sera and other animal derived culture reagents stage safety issues in clinical therapy, including possible infections and severe immune reactions. By expanding ASCs in the medium containing human serum (HS), the problem can be eliminated. To define how allogeneic HS (alloHS) performs in ASC expansion compared to FBS, a comparative in vitro study in both serum supplements was performed. The choice of serum had a significant effect on ASCs. First, to reach cell proliferation levels comparable with 10% FBS, at least 15% alloHS was required. Second, while genes of the cell cycle pathway were overexpressed in alloHS, genes of the bone morphogenetic protein receptor mediated signaling on the transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway regulating, for example, osteoblast differentiation, were overexpressed in FBS. The result was further supported by differentiation analysis, where early osteogenic differentiation was significantly enhanced in FBS. The data presented here underscore the importance of thorough investigation of ASCs for utilization in cell therapies. This study is a step forward in the understanding of these potential cells.

TI 18 α glycyrrhetinic acid alleviates oxidative damage in periodontal
   tissue by modulating the interaction of Cx43 and JNK/NF κB pathways

AB Objective: Periodontitis is a common chronic inflammatory disease in which oxidative stress is one of the key pathogenic factors. Connexin43 (Cx43) is the most critical and widely distributed connexin isoform. When the organism undergoes a severe and sustained stress response, Cx43 mediated gap junctions (GJs) are believed to underlie the biology of tissue injury exacerbation and amplification. Notably, 18 a glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is a classical pharmacological inhibitor of GJs and has antioxidant potential. However, the regulatory role of GA in the redox signaling of periodontal tissues and the potential mechanisms of Cx43 in the pathogenesis of periodontitis remain uncertain.Methods: In this study, we evaluated the effects and mechanisms of GA in alleviating oxidative damage of periodontal tissues and cells by constructing an H2O2 induced oxidative stress model in human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) and a periodontitis model in rats.Results: Cellular experiments showed that GA effectively attenuated H2O2 induced oxidative damage in hPDLCs by inhibiting the expression and function of Cx43. In addition, pretreatment of hPDLCs with either GA or SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) inhibited the Cx43/JNK/NF ?B pathway, restored cell viability, and reduced apoptosis. Animal experiment results showed that GA intervention reduced alveolar bone resorption and periodontal tissue destruction, inhibited osteoclast differentiation, improved mitochondrial structural abnormalities and dysfunction in periodontal tissue, and decreased oxidative stress levels and apoptosis in rats with periodontitis.Conclusion: Overall, our findings suggest that the Cx43/JNK/NF ?B pathway may play a vital role to promote periodontitis progression, while GA reduces oxidative stress and apoptosis by inhibiting the interaction of Cx43 and JNK/NF ?B pathways, thus alleviating oxidative damage in the periodontal tissues.

AB Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) can be associated with nitrogen containing bisphosphonates (NBPs) therapy. Various mechanisms of NBP associated ONJ have been proposed and there is currently no consensus of the underlying pathogenesis. The detailed medical and dental histories of 30 ONJ patients treated with NBPs for malignant diseases (24) or osteoporosis (6) were analyzed. The necrotic bone was resected and analyzed histologically after demineralization. In 10 patients the perinecrotic bone was also resected and processed without demineralization. Alveolar bone samples from 5 healthy patients were used as controls. In 14 ONJ patients, serial technetium 99m methylene diphosphonate scintigraphic scans were also available and confronted to the other data. Strong radionuclide uptake was detected in some patients several months before clinical diagnosis of ONJ. The medullary spaces of the necrotic bone were filled with bacterial aggregates. In the perinecrotic bone, the bacteria free bone Marrow characteristically showed an inflammatory reaction. The number of medullary inflammatory cells taken as an index of inflammation allowed us to discriminate two inflammation grades in the ONJ samples. Low grade inflammation, characterized by marrow fibrosis and low inflammatory cells infiltration, increased numbers of TRAP(+) mono  and multineacleated cells was seen in patients with bone exposure <2 cm(2). High grade inflammation, associated with larger lesions, showed amounts of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase(+)/calcitonin receptor( ) mono  and multinucleated cells, osteocyte apoptosis, hypervascularization and high inflammatory cell infiltration. The clinical extent of ONJ was statistically linked to the numbers of inflammatory cell. Taken together these data suggest that bone necrosis precedes clinical onset and is an inflammation associated process. We hypothesize that from an initial focus, bone damage spreads centrifugally, both deeper into the jaw and towards the mucosa before the oral bone exposure and the clinical diagnosis of ONJ.

AB Background Osteophyte development is a common characteristic of inflammatory skeletal diseases. Elevated osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) participates in pathological osteogenesis. Integrin linked kinase (ILK) positively regulates the osteoblastic differentiation of osteoprogenitors, but whether the ILK blockage prevents osteophytes and its potential mechanism is still unknown. Furthermore, the low dose tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) promotes osteogenic differentiation, but a lack of study reports on the relationship between this cytokine and ILK. OSU T315 is a small ILK inhibitor, which was used to determine the effect of ILK inhibition on osteogenesis and osteophyte formation. Methods and results The osteogenesis of BMSCs was evaluated using Alizarin red S staining, alkaline phosphatase, collagen type I alpha 2 chain, and bone gamma carboxyglutamate protein. The expression and phosphorylation of protein were assessed through western blot. Immunofluorescence was employed to display the distribution of beta catenin. microCT, hematoxylin eosin, and safranin O/fast green staining were utilized to observe the osteophyte formation in collagen antibody induced arthritis mice. We found that ILK blockage significantly declined calcium deposition and osteoblastic markers in a dose  and time dependent manner. Furthermore, it lowered osteogenesis in the TNF alpha induced inflammatory microenvironment by diminishing the effect of ILK and inactivating the Akt/ GSK 3 beta/ beta catenin pathway. Nuclear beta catenin was descended by OSU T315 as well. Finally, the ILK suppression restrained osteophyte formation but not inflammation in vivo. Conclusions ILK inhibition lowered osteogenesis in TNF alpha related inflammatory conditions by deactivating the Akt/ GSK 3 beta/ beta catenin pathway. This may be a potential strategy to alleviate osteophyte development in addition to anti inflammatory treatment.

AB Background: The activation of P2Y(14) receptor (P2Y(14)R) promotes osteoclast formation and causes neuropathic pain, exhibiting possible link to osteoarthritis (OA). Given lack of P2Y(14)R antagonist, the present study aims to search a novel P2Y(14)R antagonist with low toxicity and high activity from natural products as a possible drug candidate in treatment of OA. Methods: The role of P2Y(14)R on OA was verified using P2Y(14)R knockout (KO) rats. Molecular docking virtual screening strategy and activity test in P2Y(14)R stably expressed HEK293 cells were used to screen target com pound from natural product library. The MM/GBSA free energy calculation/decomposition technique was used to determine the principal interaction mechanism. Next, the binding of target compound to P2Y(14)R was examined using cellular thermal shift assay and drug affinity responsive target stability test. Finally, the ther apeutic effect of target compound was performed in monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) induced OA mouse model. To verify whether the effect of target compound was attributed to P2Y(14)R, we establish the osteoarthritis model in P2Y(14)R KO mice to perform pharmacodynamic evaluation. Importantly, to investigate the potential mecha nism by which target compound attenuate OA, expressions of the major transcription factors involved in oste oclast differentiation were detected by western blot, while markers of nerve damage in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) were evaluated by RT qPCR and immunofluorescence techniques. Results: Deficiency of P2Y(14)R alleviated pain behavior and cartilage destruction in MIA induced OA rats. 14 natural compounds were screened by Glide docking based virtual screening, among which paederosidic acid exhibited the highest antagonistic activity to P2Y(14)R with IC50 of 8.287 mu M. As a bioactive component extracted from Paederia scandens, paederosidic acid directly interacted with P2Y(14)R to enhance the thermostability and decrease the protease sensitivity of target protein, which significantly inhibited receptor activator for nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) mediated osteoclastogenesis. More importantly, paederosidic acid suppressed osteo clast formation by downregulating expressions of NFAT2 and ATP6V0D2, as well as relieved neuropathic pain by decreasing expressions of CGRP, CSF1 and galanin in DRG. Conclusions: Paederosidic acid targeted P2Y(14)R to improve OA through alleviating osteoclast formation and neuropathic pain, which provided an available strategy for developing novel drug leads for treatment of OA.

AB BACKGROUND. Lyric bone metastases occur frequently in cancer patients and present major clinical issues including lack of effective therapies. The mechanism of lytic bone metastases involves interactions between tumor cells, bone matrix, and bone cells. Both focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Pyk2 are implicated in the biology and physiology of bone and cancer.
   METHODS. The efficacy of PF 562,271 was evaluated using MDA MB 231 cells implanted in the tibia of nude rats. The drug was administered orally at a dose of 5 mg/kg, 7 days per week for 28 days. Serum and urine biomarkers, imaging, and histologic techniques were deployed to monitor tumor take rate, disease progression, and response to therapy.
   RESULTS. The compound was well tolerated. Both compound treated groups demonstrated significant and similar increases in osteocalcin and cancellous bone parameters. Radiographic evaluation of tumor bearing tibiae revealed tumor expansion in nontreated rats compared with a decrease in tumor growth and signs of bone healing in rats treated with PF 562,271. Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase and fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the majority of bone resorption at the tumor site was performed by osteoclasts of rat origin.
   CONCLUSIONS. The oral administration of PF 562,271 at a dose of 5 mg/kg suppressed the growth and local spread of intratibial tumors and restored tumor induced bone loss. The unique ability of PF 562,271 to both curb tumor growth and safely increase bone formation may be an effective therapy for many cancer patients with bone metastases and cancer associated osteoporosis.

AB Chronic inflammation is a common underlying factor in osteoarthritis (OA) and most age related degenerative diseases. As conventional therapies help only in partial alleviation of symptoms in OA, stem cell based therapies and herbal supplements are being widely explored. Thymoquinone (TQ), an active ingredient ofNigella sativais reported to have immunomodulatory, anti inflammatory and antioxidant properties. We evaluated the effects of TQ on bone marrow MSCs (BM MSCs) derived from OA patients and its interrelated pathways in inflammation and age related degenerative diseases using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) as well as possible molecular targets using SwissTargetPrediction. BM MSCs were derived from OA patients and their stemness properties were characterized by studying the MSCs related CD surface marker expression and differentiation into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes. Treatment with TQ (100 nM 5 mu M) demonstrated cell death, especially at higher concentrations. MTT assay demonstrated a significant concentration dependent decrease in cell viability which ranged from 20.04% to 69.76% with higher doses (300 nM, 1 mu M, and 5 mu M), especially at 48h and 72h. Additional cell viability testing with CellTiter Blue also demonstrated a significant concentration dependent decrease in cell viability which ranged from 27.80 to 73.67% with higher doses (300 nM, 1 mu M, 3 mu M, and 5 mu M). Gene expression analysis following treatment of BM MSCs with TQ (1 and 3 mu M) for 48h showed upregulation of the anti inflammatory genesIL 4andIL 10. In contrast, the pro inflammatory genes namelyIFN gamma,TNF alpha,COX 2,IL 6,IL 8,IL 16, andIL 12Aalthough were upregulated, compared to the lower concentration of TQ (1 mu M) they were all decreased at 3 mu M. The pro apoptoticBAXgene was downregulated while theSURVIVINgene was upregulated. IPA of the molecular interaction of TQ in inflammation and age related degenerative diseases identified canonical pathways directly related to synaptogenesis, neuroinflammation, TGF beta, and interleukin signaling. Further screening led to the identification of 36 molecules that are involved in apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. SwissTargetPrediction of TQ identified potential molecular targets with high probability. TQ exerted anti inflammatory effects and therefore can be a useful adjuvant along with conventional therapies against inflammation in OA and other age related degenerative diseases.

AB One of the most prominent characteristics of bisphosphonate related osteonecrosis of the jaw(BRONJ) is its site specificity. Osteonecrosis tends to occur specifically in maxillofacial bones, in spite of a systemic administration of the medicine. Previous studies suggested rich blood supply and fast bone turnover might be reasons for BRONJ. Yet, a sound scientific basis explaining its occurrence is still lacking. The present study aimed to explore the role of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), an important oral pathogen, on the site specificity of bisphosphonate induced osteonecrosis and to elucidate its underlying mechanism. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with zoledronic acid (ZA) or saline for 3 weeks. In the third week, the right mandibular first molars were extracted and circular bone defects with a diameter of 1 mm were created in right femurs. After the operation, drug administration was continued, and P. gingivalis suspension was applied to the oral cavities and femur defects. The mice were killed after four or eight weeks postoperatively. The right mandibles and femurs were harvested for micro CT and histological analyses. A poor healing of bone defects of both jaws and femurs was noted in mice injected with both ZA and P. gingivalis. Micro CT analysis showed a decreased bone volume, and histological staining showed an increased number of empty osteocyte lacunae, a decreased collagen regeneration, an increased inflammatory infiltration and a decreased number of osteoclasts. In addition, the left femurs were collected for isolation of osteoclast precursors (OCPs). The osteoclastogenesis potential of OCPs was analyzed in vitro. OCPs extracted from mice of ZA treated groups were shown to have a lower osteoclast differentiation potential and the expression level of related genes and proteins was declined. In conclusion, we established a mouse model of bisphosphonate related osteonecrosis of both the jaw and femur. P. gingivalis could inhibit the healing of femur defects under the administration of ZA. These findings suggest that P. gingivalis in the oral cavity might be one of the steering compounds for BRONJ to occur.

AB Here, we focus on the fabrications of an osteosarcoma implant for bone repair via the development of a hydroxyapatite/kappa carrageenan maleic anhydride/casein with doxorubicin (HAP/kappa CA MA CAS/DOX) composite deposited titanium (Ti) plate. The HAP/kappa CA MA CAS/DOX material was coated on the Ti plate through the EPD method (electrophoretic deposition), applying direct current (DC) signals to deposit the composite on the surface of the Ti plate. The physicochemical and morphological possessions and biocompatibility in vitro of the prepared nanocomposite were examined to assess its prospective effectiveness for purposes of bone regeneration. Excellent biocompatibility and elevated osteoconductivity were confirmed using MG63 osteoblast like cells. In vivo studies were performed at tibia sites in Wistar rats, and rapid bone regeneration was detected at four weeks in defective bone. Overall, the studies demonstrate that the HAP/kappa CA MA CAS/DOX composite enhances the biocompatible and cell stimulating biointerface of Ti metallic implants.

AB BackgroundStudies have shown associations between Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and non antimicrobial medications including proton pump inhibitors, osteoporosis medications, and antidepressants.
   ObjectivesOur primary objective was to evaluate oral bisphosphonates and reported CDI adverse drug reactions in the United States using the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System data (FAERS).
   MethodsWe performed a disproportionality analysis evaluating the proportion of reports with bisphosphonates and CDI compared with other adverse drug reactions in the database. A relatively increased number of reports for a given adverse drug reaction (ADR) is termed a signal. Four major measures of association are used to describe reports: reporting odds ratio, proportional reporting ratio, information component, and empirical Bayes geometric mean. Drugs with statistically significant safety signals were stratified by age (18 40, 41 65, and 65+ years) and gender.
   ResultsAlendronate had 0.4% (103/23,603) reports with CDI. There were 0.4% (16/3672) and 0.2% (17/7945) of reports for risedronate and ibandronate, respectively. Alendronate (Fosamax) was the only drug with a significant signal using all four calculation methods. For reports with gender available, alendronate CDI ADRs were more common for women (0.45% [93/20,586]) versus men (0.25% [4/1568]), and a signal was detected with all four methods. For reports with age available, there were limited alendronate reports for those 18 39 years of age, and CDI reports were present in 0.50% (27/5350) of cases of 40 64 years and 0.49% (42/8525) of cases aged 65 or older.
   ConclusionAlendronate was associated with a high number of CDI ADRs relative to other drugs in FAERS. This signal was strongest for women and those 40 years or older. This interesting finding should be interpreted with caution, and further research is warranted.

AB Despite advances in treatment modalities, bone tumour therapies still face significant challenges. Severe side effects of conventional approaches, such as chemo  and radiation therapy, result in poor survival rates and high tumour recurrence rates, which are the most common issues that need to be improved upon. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic properties of 45S5 bioactive glass (BG) for targeting bone tumours. The viability of the cells derived from osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and giant cell tumours was significantly reduced in the presence of 45S5 BG. In contrast, the viability of non malignant osteoblast like cells, chondrocytes, and bone marrow derived stromal cells was not or only slightly affected. While alterations to the particle surface induced by heat treatment, acid etching, or incubation in a simulated body fluid had only minor effects on cytotoxicity, reducing the particle size or sintering the material significantly improved the cytotoxic effect of 45S5 BG. Further, using a chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay, the co transplantation of 45S5 BG resulted in a significant reduction in tumour formation in vivo. Given the known positive effects of BGs on bone regeneration, our findings suggest that 45S5 BG holds great potential for the development of new and effective bone tumour therapies, with minimal side effects on non malignant cells and simultaneous contribution to bone healing.

AB Background: Previously, we reported that low intensity laser irradiation accelerated bone formation, and that this mechanism deeply involved insulin like growth factor I expression However, as bone formation is supported by many local factors, the mechanism involved in laser irradiation remains incompletely understood Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of laser irradiation on the osteogenic response in vitro
   Methods: Mouse osteoblast like cells, MC3T3 E1, were cultured and were irradiated for 5 20 minutes (0.96 3 82J/cm(2)) at the subconfluent stage using a low intensity Ga Al As diode laser apparatus After laser irradiation, expression of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), transcription factors (Runx2, Osterix, Dlx5, Msx2), and phosphorylation of Smad1 were determined, and calcium content of cell cultures was also determined.
   Results: Irradiation at 1.91 J/cm(2) significantly increased the expression of BMPs and Runx2, Osterix, Dlx5, Msx2, and the phosphorylation of Smad1 Noggin, a BMP receptor blocker, inhibited the laser induced Runx2 expression and phosphorylation of Smad1 Moreover, laser irradiation significantly increased the calcium content of cell cultures, and noggin inhibited this increase.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that low intensity laser irradiation stimulates in vitro mineralization via increased expression of BMPs and transcription factors associated with osteoblast differentiation Lasers Surg. Med. 42.519 526, 2010 (C) 2010 Wiley Liss, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite extensive use of standard therapy for secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) in dialysis patients, still most patients do not achieve the recommended treatment targets. In a pan European observational study (ECHO), the effectiveness of the calcimimetic cinacalcet for the treatment of sHPT was evaluated in real world clinical practice. A sub analysis of the entire Austrian study cohort is presented. METHODS: Adult dialysis patients who had initiated cinacalcet therapy were included. Data on biochemical parameters of bone and mineral metabolism (intact parathyroid hormone [iPTH], calcium [Ca] and phosphorus [P]) and concurrent medication were collected 6 months prior to the initiation of cinacalcet, at initiation (baseline) and after up to 12 months of active treatment. RESULTS: A total of 320 patients (mean age (+/  SD): 56 (+/  14) years) from 34 Austrian dialysis centres were enrolled. At baseline, patients presented with elevated serum iPTH (median 605 pg/ml) and hyperphosphataemia (median 2.1 mmol/l). After 12 months of cinacalcet treatment, serum iPTH (median percentage change  48%), calcium ( 2%) and phosphorus ( 6%) decreased. The greatest iPTH reduction ( 66%) was found in patients with most severe sHPT (> 800 pg/ml at baseline). The proportion of patients achieving the recommended NKF/K DOQI((TM)) treatment targets increased from baseline to month 12 for iPTH (3 36%) and phosphorus (24 to 39%) and remained stable for calcium (51 to 50%), respectively. No patient had all 3 parameters simultaneously within NKF/K DOQI((TM)) treatment targets at baseline, while 7% of patients achieved this treatment goal after 12 months. During the study the use of the phosphate binder sevelamer remained fairly stable, while the relative percentage use of calcium based phosphate binders increased and the usage of aluminium containing binders decreased; vitamin D analogue use remained stable. CONCLUSION: Additional use of cinacalcet improved biochemical parameters of bone and mineral metabolism and enabled more patients to achieve and maintain the KDOQI((TM)) treatment targets for serum iPTH, calcium and phosphorus.

AB Topiramate [2,3:4,5 bis o (1 methylethylidene) beta D fructo pyranose sulfamate; TPM] is one of the most used new generation antiepileptic drugs. It has been reported to regulate the differentiation of human bone cells. However, the molecular mechanism of TPM in osteoblast differentiation is not fully elucidated. In the present study, we examined the effect of TPM on osteogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2, MC3T3 E1, primary mouse calvarial cells, and primary bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs). Primary cells were isolated from mice calvaria and bone marrow respectively. Expression of the osteogenic gene was determined by RT PCR. The osteogenic protein levels were measured by Western blot analysis. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining experiment was performed to evaluate ALP activity. Alizarin red s (ARS) staining was performed to measure zebrafish caudal fin regeneration. Treatment of TPM up regulated the osteogenic genes including distal less homeobox 5 (Dlx5) and runtrelated transcription factor 2 (Runx2). In addition, TPM also increased the Dlx5 and Runx2 protein levels, Smad1/5/9 phosphorylation, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Furthermore, TPM activated AMPK, and inhibition of AMPK decreased TPM induced osteogenic differentiation. In the zebrafish model, osteogenic effect of TPM was identified. TPM was increased amputated caudal fin rays of zebrafish. These results demonstrate that TPM enhances osteogenic differentiation via AMPK mediated Smad1/5/9 phosphorylation.

AB There is a strong need to search for more effective compounds with bone anti resorptive properties, which will cause fewer complications than commonly used bisphosphonates. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to search for new techniques to characterize the interactions between bone and drug. By studying their interaction with hydroxyapatite (HA), this study used three forms of ceramic materials, two of which are bone stimulating materials, to assess the suitability of new active substances with antiresorptive properties. In this study, three methods based on HA in loose form, polycaprolactone/HA (a polymer ceramic materials containing HA), and polymer ceramic monolithic in needle extraction (MINE) device (a polymer inert skeleton), respectively, were used. The affinity of risedronate (a standard compound) and sixteen aminomethylenebisphosphonates (new compounds with potential antiresorptive properties) to HA was defined according to the above mentioned methods. Ten monolithic materials based on 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate/ethylene dimethacrylate are prepared and studied, of which one was selected for more detailed further research. Simulated body fluids containing bisphosphonates were passed through the MINE device. In this way, sorption desorption of bisphosphonates was evaluated using this MINE device. The paper presents the advantages and disadvantages of each technique and its suitability for assessing new active substances. All three methods allow for the selection of several compounds with potentially higher anti resorptive properties than risedronate, in hope that it reflects their higher bone affinity and release ability.

AB This study investigated the role of the prostaglandin (PG) pathway in locally applied, simvastatin induced oral bone growth. The possibility of enhancing long term bone augmentation with an alendronate based carrier was initiated. Mandibles of 44 mature female rats were treated bilaterally with the following combinations: 2 mg of simvastatin in ethanol (SIM EtOH), EtOH, 2 mg of simvastatin acid complexed with alendronate beta cyclodextrin conjugate (SIM/ALN CD), ALN CD, or ALN. Bone wash technology (injection of PBS and re collection by suction) was used to sample injection sites at baseline (day 0), and 3, 7, 14, and 21 days post treatment. After 21 24 or 48 days, histomorphometric analysis was done. The amount of PGE(2) in bone wash fluid was measured by ELISA, normalized by total protein, and compared between high and low bone growth groups (ANOVA) and correlated with subsequent bone histology at 21 days (Spearman). SIM stimulated PGE(2) synthase and EP4 receptor mRNA in murine osteoblast and fibroblast cell lines were evaluated with real time PCR Single injections of 2 mg of SIM EtOH induced significantly more new bone than control side after 21 days. PGE(2)/protein ratios peaked at day 7 and were correlated with the subsequent 21 day new bone width. The correlations at day 14 between PGE(2) and new bone width changed to a negative relationship in the test group. SIM stimulated osteoblasts expressed increased mRNA levels of PGE receptor EP4, while SIM activated PGE synthesis in fibroblasts. SIM/ALN CD tended to preserve bone long term. Findings suggest that PGE pathway activation and higher levels of PGE(2) during the first week following SIM induced bone growth are desirable, and alendronate beta cyclodextrin conjugates not only act as tissue specific carriers, but preserve new bone.

TI Co targeting RANK pathway treats and prevents acquired resistance to

AB The combination of endocrine therapy (ET) and cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors (CDK4/6i) was a hallmark in metastatic luminal breast cancer (BC). However, intrinsic and acquired resistance affects long term efficacy. Here, we study the role of the receptor activator of nuclear factor kB (RANK) pathway in CDK4/6i resistance. We find that RANK overexpression in luminal BC is associated with intrinsic resistance to CDK4/6i, both in vitro and in mouse xenografts, and decreased proliferation rate and chronic interferon (IFN) g response are highlighted as resistance drivers. Gene expression data from the NeoPalAna CDK4/6i clinical trial, and studies with palbociclib resistant cell lines, show that RANK is upregulated after treatment with CDK4/6i, supporting a role in acquired resistance. Our study shows that RANK ligand (RANKL) inhibitors can restore sensitivity to CDK4/6i and prevent acquired resistance. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that pharmacological inhibition of the RANK pathway through RANKL blocking could represent an add on to ET + CDK4/6i, warranting further clinical studies.

AB In this study, we aimed to clarify the effects of phenolic compounds and extracts from different extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) varieties obtained from fruits of different ripening stages on osteoblast cells (MG 63) proliferation. Cell proliferation was increased by hydroxytyrosol, luteolin, apigenin, p coumaric, caffeic, and ferulic acids by approximately 11 16%, as compared with controls that were treated with one vehicle alone, while (+) pinoresinol, oleuropein, sinapic, vanillic acid and derivative (vanillin) did not affect cell proliferation. All phenolic extracts stimulated MG 63 cell growth, and they induced higher cell proliferation rates than individual compounds. The most effective EVOO phenolic extracts were those obtained from the Picual variety, as they significantly increased cell proliferation by 1822%. Conversely, Arbequina phenolic extracts increased cell proliferation by 9 13%. A decline in osteoblast proliferation was observed in oils obtained from olive fruits collected at the end of the harvest period, as their total phenolic content decreases at this late stage. Further research on the signaling pathways of olive oil phenolic compounds involved in the processes and their metabolism should be carried out to develop new interventions and adjuvant therapies using EVOO for bone health (i. e. osteoporosis) in adulthood and the elderly.

AB The fluid flow in the lacunar canalicular system of bone is an essential mechanical stimulation on the osteocyte networks. Due to the complexity of human physical activities, the fluid shear stress on osteocyte bodies and processes consists of both steady and oscillatory components. In this study, we investigated and compared the intracellular calcium ([Ca2+](i)) responses of osteocytic networks under steady and oscillatory fluid flows. An in vitro osteocytic network was built with MLO Y4 osteocyte like cells using micro patterning techniques to simulate the in vivo orderly organization of osteocyte networks. Sinusoidal oscillating fluid flow or unidirectional steady flow was applied on the cell surface with 2 Pa peak shear stress. It was found that the osteocytic networks were significantly more responsive to steady flow than to oscillatory flow. The osteocytes can release more calcium peaks with higher magnitudes at a faster speed under steady flow stimulation. The [Ca2+](i) signaling transients under the steady and oscillatory flows have significantly different spatiotemporal characters, but a similar responsive percentage of cells. Further signaling pathway studies using inhibitors showed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium store, extracellular calcium source, ATP, PGE(2) and NO related pathways play similar roles in the [Ca2+](i) signaling of osteocytes under either steady or oscillating flow. The spatiotemporal characteristics of [Ca2+](i) transients under oscillating fluid flow are affected more profoundly by pharmacological treatments than under the steady flow. Our findings support the hypothesis that the [Ca2+](i) responses of osteocytic networks are significantly dependent on the profiles of fluid flow. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Aims: Diabetes associated osteoporosis is mainly caused by the formation and accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) has anabolic bone effects on the physicochemical properties of the bone in diabetes. We hypothesized that ARB could inhibit AGEs induced deleterious effects.
   Main methods: In this study, we chose seven week old Leprdb/Lepr+ (db/+) and Leprdb/Leprdb (db/db) mice. After 12 week intervention by irbesartan, the microarchitecture and mechanical strength of the bone of seven week old db/db mice were investigated systematically. Meanwhile, the molecular mechanisms of the osteoblasts were analyzed, after AGEs or irbesartan were added to the culture. Also, intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured with DCF fluorescence.
   Key foundings: Results showed that 12 week irbesartan treatment could dramatically improve trabecular bone microarchitecture through increasing BV/TV (p=0.003, + 46.7%), Tb. N (p=0.020, + 52.0%), and decreasing that of Tb. Sp (p=0.005,  21.2%) and SMI (p=0.007,  26.4%), comparing with the db/db group. Irbesartan could also substantially raise biomechanical parameters including max load (p=0.013, + 20.7%), fracture load (p=0.014, + 70.5%), energy absorption (p=0.019, + 99.4%). Besides, it could inhibit AGEs induced damage of cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts, as well as suppressing the activation of apoptosis caused by AGEs. Moreover, co incubation with irbesartan could prevent the AGEs induced increase of intracellular oxidative stress and RAGE expression in osteoblasts.
   Significance: In conclusion, this study suggested that irbesartan might play a protective role in diabetes related bone damages by blocking the deleterious effects of AGEs/RAGE mediated oxidative stress. This may provide a revolutionary benefits to therapy with irbesartan on diabetic osteoporosis.

AB The specific role of endogenous Bmp2 gene in chondrocytes and in osteoblasts in fracture healing was investigated by generation and analysis of chondrocyte  and osteoblast specific Bmp2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice. The unilateral open transverse tibial fractures were created in these Bmp2 cKO mice. Bone fracture callus samples were collected and analyzed by X ray, micro CT, histology analyses, biomechanical testing and gene expression assays. The results demonstrated that the lack of Bmp2 expression in chondrocytes leads to a prolonged cartilage callus formation and a delayed osteogenesis initiation and progression into mineralization phase with lower biomechanical properties. In contrast, when the Bmp2 gene was deleted in osteoblasts, the mice showed no significant difference in the fracture healing process compared to control mice. These findings suggest that endogenous BMP2 expression in chondrocytes may play an essential role in cartilage callus maturation at an early stage of fracture healing. Our studies may provide important information for clinical application of BMP2. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Marine organisms have bioactive potential which has tremendous pharmaceutical promise. Emerging evidence highlights the importance of the interplay between bone and the immune system of which T lymphocytes and their product act as key regulators of bone resorption. In the present investigation we have analyzed the anti osteoporotic effect of turbo methanol extract (TME) in the reversal of bone resoprtion. Forty two female Swiss albino mice were used and randomly assigned into sham operated group (sham) and six ovariectomized (OVX) subgroups, Le. OVX with vehicle (OVX) that received daily oral administration of water ad libitum; OVX with estradiol (2 mg/kg/day); and OVX with different doses of TME Le. TME 100 mg/kg, TME 50 mg/kg, TME 25 mg/kg and TME 12.5 mg/kg, Oral administration of TME or estradiol started on the second week after ovariectomy for a period of 4 weeks. We observed that the administration of TME increased the trabeculation in tibia and reduced the atrophy in the uterus. TME significantly decreased the serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and acid phosphatase (ACP) activity in OVX mice. Micro CT analysis revealed that the TME administration preserved the bone volume, connectivity density, trabecular number, trabecular thickness and trabecular separation in OVX mice. Bone mineralization was measured in different groups of mice by Raman spectroscopy. Reversal of bone resorption was observed in TME treated group of mice. To further investigate the mechanism of action of TME, we analyzed the T lymphocyte proliferation and profiles of cytokine TNF alpha and sRANKL in TME treated ovariectomized mice. Decrease in the elevation of T cell subsets was observed after the supplementation with TME. The extract significantly lowered the T cell proliferation responses to mitogens, phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate (PMA) and ionomycin (Io) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA). A marked reduction in TNF alpha and sRANKL secretion in serum and TNF alpha in cell free supernatants of activated T lymphocytes was observed upon TME administration. TME could significantly inhibit the in vitro osteoclastogenesis and the bone resorption observed using artificial calcium coated slides. Collectively, these results indicate that TME has the potential to inhibit bone resorption and may prove to be a potential candidate for the development of an anti osteoporosis drug.

TI Effect of low molecular weight heparin (dalteparin) and fondaparinux
   (Arixtra<SUP>®</SUP>) on human osteoblasts in vitro
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY

   MECHANISMS; PREVENTION; PREGNANCY
AB Background: The prolonged administration of heparin for prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism has been associated with a risk of heparin induced osteoporosis. Fondaparinux is a new antithrombotic drug that specifically inhibits factor Xa. Because of the known interactions of other antithrombotic agents with bone remodelling, the effects of fondaparinux on human osteoblasts were analysed in vitro.
   Methods: Primary human osteoblast cell cultures were incubated with either the low molecular weight heparin dalteparin at concentrations of 30, 300 and 900 mug/ml or with fondaparinux at concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 mug/ml. Cellular proliferation rate and protein synthesis were measured. Expression of genes encoding osteocalcin, collagen type I and alkaline phosphatase was examined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
   Results: Incubation with dalteparin led to a significant, dose dependent inhibition of osteoblast proliferation, inhibition of protein synthesis, and inhibited expression of phenotype markers (osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase genes) after 3 and 7 days. No inhibitory effects were observed in the fondaparinux treated cells.
   Conclusion: Fondaparinux did not inhibit osteoblast proliferation in vitro and may reduce the risk of heparin induced osteoporosis associated with long term heparin administration.

AB The synthesis and the antitumor activity and fluorescent properties screening of novel bisphosphonate conjugates with cytotoxic 3,5 bis((hetero)arylidene) 4 piperidone residues were performed. The facile and rapid synthetic route was based on the aza Michael addition of NH 3,5 bis((hetero)arylidene) 4 piperidones to tetraethyl ethylidenebisphosphonate. The synthesized compounds displayed high inhibitory properties towards Caov3, A549, PC3, and KB 3 1 human carcinoma cell lines. Among those, compounds bearing 4 cyano phenyl and 3 pyridinyl substituents were revealed as the most active drug candidates with IC50 values in the range of 0.52.5?mu M. Methylenebisphosphonate with 4 Me2N C6H4 groups in the piperidone framework possessing fluorescence properties may be of interest for visualization of BPs skeletal distribution and cellular uptake in bones and other tissues.

   Objective   Alveolar corticotomy surgery is an adjunctive therapy for reducing orthodontic treatment duration. The activation pathways of bone resorption involved in the tooth movement (TM) process are directly linked to the receptor activator of the nuclear factor kB ligand (RANKL). Whether similar molecular pathways through RANKL, are shared by the acceleratory TM process (corticotomy induced or not), sustained acceleration would therefore be expected with transgenic overexpression of this factor. We hypothesize that maintaining transgenic overexpression of RANKL will accelerate TM under force over time rather than at the beginning of therapy only; this contrasts with the corticotomy procedure.
   Material and Methods   We transfected the pcDNA3.1(+) mRANKL transgene in vitro into NIH3T3 cells, then evaluated by PCR, Western blot and ex vivo resorption assay. Quantification of RANKL immunofluorescence, fluorescence based tartrate resistant acid phosphatase+ (TRAP+) osteoclast counts and histological analyses of the bone resorption area were performed and clinically correlated after a 32 day in vivo experiment comparing corticotomy and gene therapy.
   Results   In vitro experiments resulted in increased level of RANKL protein (46%, p < 0.05) and greater mineral resorption (39%, p < 0.05) compared to the controls. In vivo results showed increased RANKL immunoexpression for both corticotomy (twofold) and transfection groups (threefold) after 10 days. After 32 days, a similar result was obtained for the transfected group but not for the surgery group. These data correlate with the clinical effect of decelerating TM in the surgery group.
   Conclusions   Selective gene therapy with RANKL has been experimentally tested as an alternative method to corticotomy surgery, showing higher effectiveness than surgical methods used for acceleratory purposes in orthodontics.

AB Type 1 diabetes mellitus is associated with a number of disorders of skeletal health, conditions that rely, in part, on dynamic bone formation. A mouse model of distraction osteogenesis was used to study the consequences of streptozotocin induced diabetes and insulin treatment on bone formation and osteoblastogenesis. In diabetic mice compared with control mice, new bone formation was decreased, and adipogenesis was increased in and around, respectively, the distraction gaps. Although insulin treatment restored bone formation to levels observed in nondiabetic control mice, it failed to significantly decrease adipogenesis. Molecular events altered during de novo bone formation in untreated type 1 diabetes mellitus, yet restored with insulin treatment were examined so as to clarify specific osteogenic genes that may contribute to diabetic bone disease. RNA from distraction gaps was analyzed by gene microarray and quantitative RT PCR for osteogenic genes of interest. Runt related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), and several RUNX2 target genes, including matrix metalloproteinase 9, Akp2, integrin binding sialoprotein, Dmp1, Col1a2, Phex, Vdr, osteocalcin, and osterix, were all significantly down regulated in the insulin deficient, hyperglycemic diabetic animals; however, insulin treatment of diabetic animals significantly restored their expression. Expression of bone morphogenic protein 2, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ binding motif, and TWIST2, all important regulators of RUNX2, were not impacted by the diabetic condition, suggesting that the defect in osteogenesis resides at the level of RUNX2 expression and its activity. Together, these data demonstrate that insulin and/or glycemic status can regulate osteogenesis in vivo, and systemic insulin therapy can, in large part, rescue the diabetic bone phenotype at the tissue and molecular level.

AB Background: Cinacalcet reduces intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), Ca and P serum levels in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). Methods: This Spanish, multicenter, observational, retrospective study collected data from SHPT dialysis patients 12 weeks before and up to 72 weeks after starting cinacalcet in clinical practice. Results: Data from 428 patients with uncontrolled SHPT despite receiving standard of care (29% with baseline iPTH 501 800 pg/ml; 51% with 1 800 pg/ml) were collected. Percentages of patients within National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative targets at baseline and 72 weeks were: iPTH, 0 versus 32.5% (p < 0.05); Ca, 40.1 versus 50% (p < 0.05); P,47.7 versus 53.8% (p = 0.162). Vitamin D sterol use decreased from 53.3% at baseline to 36.7% at 72 weeks (p < 0.05). The mean +/  SD cinacalcet dose at 72 weeks was 44.0 +/  25.8, 51.7 +/  31.3 and 57.1 +/  37.0 mg for patients with baseline iPTH 301 500, 501 800 or >800 pg/ml, respectively. The main adverse reactions were nausea (5.4%), dyspepsia (5.1%) and vomiting (3.7%). Conclusions: The introduction of cinacalcet improved the routine clinical management of SHPT in a large cohort of Spanish dialysis patients. Cinacalcet is effective and well tolerated regardless of disease severity, and maintains its efficacy over 72 weeks. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Aims: Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs are a therapeutic modality for chronic cancer pain arising from bone metastases. Chronic administration of a cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 inhibitor is effective to bone cancer related pain. However, adverse cardiovascular effects have limited COX 2 inhibitor therapy, and elucidation of better targets for blocking prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis is necessary. Microsomal PGE synthase 1 (mPGES 1) is an inducible enzyme that catalyzes isomerization of the endoperoxide PGH(2) to PGE(2). To investigate the validity of mPGES 1 as a therapeutic target, we evaluated bone cancer pain related behaviors in mPGES 1 knockout (PGES 1 / ) mice.
   Main methods: Lewis lung carcinoma cells (LLCCs) were injected into the intramedullary space of the femur of wild type (WT) and PGES 1 /  mice. Pain related behaviors were evaluated.
   Key findings: PGES 1 /  mice exhibited reduced tumor growth in bone marrow compared to WT. The expression of pro calcitonin gene related peptide (CGPR) in the dorsal root ganglia of L1 5 was significantly higher in WT mice at day 14, whereas it was unchanged in mPGES 1 mice. In the observation of pain related behaviors, mPGES 1 /  mice exhibited significantly fewer spontaneous flinches and their onset was several days later than WT. The appearance of other pain related behaviors in mPGES 1 /  mice was also delayed as compared to WT. LLCC injected WT mice treated with a COX 2 inhibitor, celecoxib, exhibited similar temporal changes to mPGES 1 / .
   Significance: The present results suggest that mPGES 1 plays a crucial role in the enhancement of bone cancer growth and bone cancer pain, and that inhibition of mPGES 1 may have clinical utility in the management of bone cancer pain. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI A Comparative Study on Inhibition of Total Astragalus Saponins and

SO PLOS ONE

AB Background: Both total astragalus saponins (AST) and it's main component astragaloside IV (ASIV) have been used in China as cardiovascular protective medicines. However, the anti inflammatory activities that are beneficial for cardiovascular health have never been compared directly and the molecular mechanisms remain unresolved. This study was conducted to compare the inhibitory effects of these drugs on TNF alpha induced cell responses, related signaling pathways, and the underlying mechanisms in mouse arterial endothelial cells.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Real time qRT PCR was performed to determine the expression of cell adhesion molecule (CAM) genes. Immunofluorescent staining was used to detect the nuclear translocation of transcription factor NF kappa B p65. Western Blot analysis was used to identify TNF alpha induced NF kappa B p65 phosphorylation, I kappa B alpha degradation, and caspase 3 cleavage. Cell surface proteins were isolated and TNF alpha receptor 1(TNFR1) expression was determined. The results suggest that both AST and ASIV attenuate TNF alpha induced up regulation of CAMs mRNA and upstream nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of NF kappa B p65. However, TNFR1 mediated I kappa B alpha degradation, cleavage of caspase 3 and apoptosis were inhibited only by AST. These differences in the actions of AST and ASIV could be explained by the presence of other components in AST, such as ASII and ASIII, which also had an inhibitory effect on TNFR1 induced I kappa B alpha degradation. Moreover, AST, but not ASIV, was able to reduce TNFR1 protein level on the cell surface. Furthermore, mechanistic investigation demonstrated that TNFR1 mediated I kappa B alpha degradation was reversed by the use of TAPI 0, an inhibitor of TNF alpha converting enzyme (TACE), suggesting the involvement of TACE in the modulation of surface TNFR1 level by AST.
   Conclusion: ASIV was not a better inhibitor than AST, at least on the inhibition of TNF alpha induced inflammatory responses and TNFR1 mediated signaling pathways in AECs. The inhibitory effect of AST was caused by the reduction of cell surface TNFR1 level, and TACE could be involved in this action.

AB Background: Bone defects can be severely debilitating and reduce quality of life. Osteo regeneration can alleviate some of the complications in bony defects. For therapeutic use in future, a single factor that can cause potent bone regeneration is highly preferred as it will be more costeffective, any off target effects will be more easily monitored and potentially managed, and for ease of administration which would lead to better patient compliance and satisfaction.
   Objective: We demonstrate that pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF), one such factor that is known to be potent against angiogenesis, promotes osteoblastogenesis in mesenchymal stem cells in vitro, but does not need co encapsulation of cells in alginate bead scaffolds for osteogeneration in vivo.
   Results: Osteogenic differentiation by PEDF in vitro was confirmed with immunoblotting and immunocytochemical staining for bone markers (alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, osteopontin, collagen I), calcified mineral deposition, and assay for alkaline phosphatase activity. PEDF mediated bone formation in a muscle pocket in vivo model was confirmed by microcomputed tomography (microCT), histology (haematoxylin and eosin, Alcian blue staining), immunostaining for bone markers and for collagen I processing proteins (heat shock protein 47 and membrane type I matrix metalloproteinase).
   Conclusion: PEDF therefore presents itself as a promising biological for osteogeneration.

   OVEREXPRESSION
AB Muscleblind like 1 (MBNL1) is a ubiquitously expressed RNA binding protein, which is highly expressed in skeletal muscle. Abnormally expanded CUG repeats in the DMPK gene cause myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) by sequestration of MBNL1 to nuclear RNA foci and by upregulation of another RNA binding protein, CUG binding protein 1 (CUGBP1). We previously reported that a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug (NSAID), phenylbutazone, upregulates MBNL1 expression in DM1 mouse model by demethylation of MeR2, an enhancer element in Mbnl1 intron 1. NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX), which is comprised of COX 1 and COX 2 isoforms. In this study, we screened 29 NSAIDs in C2C12 myoblasts, and found that 13 NSAIDs enhanced Mbnl1 expression, where COX 1 selective NSAIDs upregulated Mbnl1 more than COX 2 selective NSAIDs. Consistently, knockdown of COX 1, but not of COX 2, upregulated MBNL1 expression in C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes, as well as in myotubes differentiated from DM1 patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Luciferase assay showed that COX 1 knockdown augmented the MeR2 enhancer activity. Furthermore, bisulfite sequencing analysis demonstrated that COX 1 knockdown suppressed methylation of MeR2. These results suggest that COX 1 inhibition upregulates Mbnl1 transcription through demethylation of the MeR2 enhancer. Taken together, our study provides new insights into the transcriptional regulation of Mbnl1 by the COX 1 mediated pathway.

AB Objective: The local delivery of growth factors such as bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP 7) into the tissues around dental implants may improve their osseointegration. We have designed a new method of attaching BMP 7 to a titanium surface and assessed both the retention of the BMP 7 and its effect on osteoblast differentiation.
   Design: Adenoviral vector expressing BMP 7 was attached to dental titanium discs by hexon specific antibodies in a type I collagen avidin gel. FITC labelled secondary antibody was used to measure the continuing adherence of the coating after repeated rinsing. Osteoblasts were harvested and seeded on the titanium discs. Gene transduction efficiency and targeting ability were assessed after 24 h. Surface morphology was observed by SEM. Cell proliferation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities were measured.
   Results: The anti adenohexon antibody adhered strongly to the collagen avidin gels. BMP 7 gene expression was localized precisely to cells growing on the gels bound by the hexon specific antibody. Osteoblasts on the titanium containing Ad BMP 7 had a higher ALP activity than those without Ad BMP 7.
   Conclusions: This study describes a novel technique for the precise attachment of BMP 7 to titanium surfaces. The process may enhance the osseointegration of dental implants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Bone morphogenetic protein signalling is required for the anti mitogenic

AB Background and purpose: Inhibition of proteasome has been emerging as a promising approach in pathway directed cancer therapy. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling, which is known to be regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway in osteoblasts, plays a crucial role in the suppression of gastrointestinal carcinogenesis. Here we sought to elucidate the antimitogenic effect of a proteasome inhibitor in relation to BMP signalling in colon cancer.
   Experimental approach: The effects of the proteasome inhibitor MG 132 on proliferation of SW1116 and HT 29 colon cancer cells were determined by [H 3] thymidine incorporation and colony formation assay. The involvement of BMP signalling in the action of MG 132 was elucidated by western blot, real time PCR, immunofluorescence and RNA interference.
   Key results: MG 132 significantly suppressed the proliferation of colon cancer SW1116 and HT 29 cells. In this regard, MG 132 activated BMP signalling and this was manifested as an increase in Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and upregulation of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) expression. Knockdown of BMP receptor II abolished Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation, the induction of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) and inhibition of cell proliferation induced by MG 132. Further analysis revealed that MG 132 upregulated the expression of BMP1 and BMP2, which are secreted members of the BMP superfamily. Moreover, the expression of Smad6, an intracellular inhibitor of BMP signalling, was suppressed by MG 132.
   Conclusions and implications: These findings suggest that inhibition of proteasome suppresses the proliferation of colon cancer cells via activation of BMP signalling. They also demonstrate a novel aspect of proteasome function in the regulation of colon cancer cell proliferation.

AB Background: The Notch signalling pathway has been reported to play a key role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) development. Thus, inhibition of the activation of this signalling pathway may be a promising approach to the treatment of RA. In this study, the Notch signalling inhibitor LY411575, which can inhibit both Notch1 and Notch3, was used for the treatment of collagen induced arthritis (CIA) rats.
   Methods: Wistar rats were immunised with bovine type II collagen (CII) to establish rats CIA model. The inhibitory effects of LY411575 on Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD) and Notch3 intracellular domain (N3ICD) protein was verified by western blot (WB) in vitro. CIA rats were treated with different doses of LY411575 for 15 and 28 days, respectively. Methotrexate and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC Na) were used as positive and negative (vehicle) control respectively. Destruction of the rat ankle joint and the bone loss on the periarticular side were evaluated by micro computed tomography (Micro CT). In addition, destruction of the ankle articular cartilage and the osteoclast numbers were determined by histology. Expression of N1ICD and N3ICD in the ankle joint was detected by immunohistochemistry.
   Results: LY411575 could significantly inhibit the expression of N1ICD and N3ICD in vitro. Micro CT test showed that the ankle joint destruction significantly improved after treatment with LY411575 (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively). The bone quality in the LY411575 (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively) groups were improved compared with the vehicle group. Histological analysis showed that LY411575 (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively) treatment reduced the severity of ankle joint inflammation in CIA rats (including ankle joint destruction, pannus formation, and cartilage damage) and reduced the expression of N1ICD and N3ICD in CIA rats ankle joints significantly.
   Conclusion: The inhibitor of Notch signalling LY411575 is an effective treatment for CIA.
   The translational potential of this article: Our study provides new evidence to support the potential clinical application of Notch signalling pathway inhibitor LY411575 as a drug candidate for the treatment of RA.

AB Charcot neuro osteoarthropathy (CN) is one of the most challenging foot complications in diabetes. Common predisposing and precipitating factors include neuropathy and increased mechanical forces, fracture and bone resorption, trauma and inflammation. In the last 15years, considerable progress has been made in the early recognition of the acute Charcot foot when the X ray is still negative (stage 0 or incipient Charcot foot). Recent advances in imaging modalities have enabled the detection of initial signs of inflammation and underlying bone damage before overt bone and joint destruction has occurred. Casting therapy remains the mainstay of medical therapy of acute CN. If timely instituted, offloading can arrest disease activity and prevent foot deformity. In cases with severe deformity, modern surgical techniques can correct the unstable deformity for improved functional outcome and limb survival. Emerging new studies into the cellular mechanisms of severe bone destruction have furthered our understanding of the mechanisms of pathological bone and joint destruction in CN. It is hoped that these studies may provide a scientific basis for new interventions with biological agents. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Necroptosis is a form of cell death that is reportedly involved in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. The role of Mlkl involved necroptosis remains unclear. Herein, this project aimed to explore the role of MLKL mediated necroptosis in periodontitis in vitro and in vivo. Expression of RIPK3, MLKL, and phosphorylated MLKL was observed in gingival tissues obtained from healthy subjects or patients with periodontitis. The cell viability of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS Pg) treated cells was detected. In wild type or Mlkl deficiency mice with ligature induced periodontitis, alveolar bone loss and osteoclast activation were assessed. mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines in bone marrow derived macrophages were tested by qRT PCR. Increased expression of RIPK3, MLKL, and phosphorylated MLKL was observed in gingival tissues obtained from patients with periodontitis. Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS Pg) treated cells developed necroptosis after caspase inhibition and negatively regulated the NF kappa B signaling pathway. In mice with ligature induced periodontitis, Mlkl deficiency reduced alveolar bone loss and weakened osteoclast activation. Furthermore, genetic ablation of Mlkl in LPS Pg treated bone marrow derived macrophages increased the mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (Il) 1 beta, Il 6, cyclooxygenase 2, matrix metalloproteinase 9, and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand. Our data indicated that MLKL mediated necroptosis aggravates the development of periodontitis in a Mlkl deficient mouse. This will provide a new sight for the understanding of etiology and therapies of periodontitis. Key messages MLKL expression was up regulated in inflamed human gingival tissue. Mlkl deficiency affected the progression of periodontitis. Necroptosis played a major role in mice periodontitis model. Knockout of Mlkl had a significant effect on inflammatory responses.

AB Synovial macrophages are crucial in the development of joint inflammation and bone damage; however, the pathways that control macrophage remodeling in inflammatory M1 cells or bone eroding osteoclasts are not fully understood. We determined that elevated IL 7R/CD127 expression is the hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) M1 macrophages and that these cells are highly responsive to interleukin 7 (IL 7) driven osteoclastogenesis. We established that lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interferon gamma (IFN gamma), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), the classic M1 macrophage mediators, enhance IL 7R expression in RA and murine macrophages. The local expression of IL 7 provokes arthritis, predominantly through escalating the number of F480(+)iNOS(+)cells rather than CD3(+)T cells. Ectopic LPS injection stabilizes IL 7 induced arthritis by increasing myeloid IL 7R expression, in part via IFN gamma induction. Hence, in RAG /  mice, IL 7 mediated arthritis is suppressed because of the reduction in myeloid IL 7R expression due to the lack of IFN gamma. Moreover, the amelioration of IL 7 induced arthritis by anti TNF therapy is due to a decrease in the number of cells in the unique F480(+)iNOS(+)IL 7R(+)CCL5(+)subset, with no impact on the F480(+)Arginase(+)cell or CD3(+)T cell frequency. Consistent with the preclinical findings, the findings of a phase 4 study performed with RA patients following 6 months of anti TNF therapy revealed that IL 7R expression was reduced without affecting the levels of IL 7. This study shifts the paradigm by discovering that IL 7 induced arthritis is dependent on F480(+)iNOS(+)IL 7R(+)CCL5(+)cell function, which activates TH 1 cells to amplify myeloid IL 7R expression and disease severity.

AB Background and objectives: Cinacalcet, a novel calcimimetic, targets the calcium sensing receptor to lower parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, and phosphorus levels in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). This study compared the efficacy of a cinacalcet based regimen with unrestricted conventional care (vitamin D and phosphate binders) for achieving the stringent National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) targets for dialysis patients.
   Study design: In this multicenter, open label study, hemodialysis patients with poorly controlled SHPT were randomized to receive conventional care (n = 184) or a cinacalcet based regimen (n = 368). Doses of cinacalcet, vitamin D sterols, and phosphate binders were adjusted during a 16 wk dose optimization phase with the use of algorithms that allowed cinacalcet to be used with adjusted doses of vitamin D. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with mean intact PTH <= 300 pg/ml during a 7 wk efficacy assessment phase.
   Results: A higher proportion of patients receiving the cinacalcet based regimen versus conventional care achieved the targets for PTH (71% versus 22%, respectively; P < 0.001), Ca x P (77% versus 58%, respectively; P < 0.001), calcium (76% versus 33%, respectively; P < 0.001), phosphorus (63% versus 50%, respectively; P = 0.002), and PTH and Ca x P (59% versus 16%, respectively, P < 0.001), and allowed a 22% reduction in vitamin D dosage in patients receiving vitamin D at baseline. Achievement of targets was greatest in patients with less severe disease (intact PTH range, 300 to 500 pg/ml) and the cinacalcet dose required was lower in these patients (median = 30 mg/d).
   Conclusions: Compared with conventional therapy, a cinacalcet based treatment algorithm increased achievement of KDOQI treatment targets in dialysis patients in whom conventional therapy was no longer effective in controlling this disease.

AB Background Late stage breast cancer preferentially metastasises to bone; despite advances in targeted therapies, this condition remains incurable. The lack of clinically relevant models for studying breast cancer metastasis to a human bone microenvironment has stunted the development of effective treatments for this condition. To address this problem, we have developed humanised mouse models in which breast cancer patient derived xenografts (PDXs) metastasise to human bone implants with low variability and high frequency. Methods To model the human bone environment, bone discs from femoral heads of patients undergoing hip replacement surgery were implanted subcutaneously into NOD/SCID mice. For metastasis studies, 7 patient derived xenograft tumours (PDX: BB3RC32, ER+ PR+ HER2 ; BB2RC08, ER+ PR+ ER2 ; BB6RC37, ER  PR  HER2  and BB6RC39, ER+ PR+ HER2+), MDA MB 231 luc2, T47D luc2 or MCF7 Luc2 cells were injected into the 4th mammary ducts and metastases monitored by luciferase imaging and confirmed on histological sections. Bone integrity, viability and vascularisation were assessed by uCT, calcein uptake and histomorphometry. Expression profiling of genes/proteins during different stages of metastasis were assessed by whole genome Affymetrix array, real time PCR and immunohistochemistry. Importance of IL 1 was confirmed following anakinra treatment. Results Implantation of femoral bone provided a metabolically active, human specific site for tumour cells to metastasise to. After 4 weeks, bone implants were re vascularised and demonstrated active bone remodelling (as evidenced by the presence of osteoclasts, osteoblasts and calcein uptake). Restricting bone implants to the use of subchondral bone and introduction of cancer cells via intraductal injection maximised metastasis to human bone implants. MDA MB 231 cells specifically metastasised to human bone (70% metastases) whereas T47D, MCF7, BB3RC32, BB2RC08, and BB6RC37 cells metastasised to both human bone and mouse bones. Importantly, human bone was the preferred metastatic site especially from ER+ PDX (100% metastasis human bone compared with 20 75% to mouse bone), whereas ER ve PDX developed metastases in 20% of human and 20% of mouse bone. Breast cancer cells underwent a series of molecular changes as they progressed from primary tumours to bone metastasis including altered expression of IL 1B, IL 1R1, S100A4, CTSK, SPP1 and RANK. Inhibiting IL 1B signalling significantly reduced bone metastasis. Conclusions Our reliable and clinically relevant humanised mouse models provide significant advancements in modelling of breast cancer bone metastasis.

AB An association has been previously established between uncompensated diabetes mellitus and the loss of bone mineral density and/or quality. In this study, we evaluated the effects of metformin on the growth and differentiation of osteoblasts in culture Treatment of two osteoblast like cells (UMR106 and MC3T3E1) with metformin (25 500 mu M) for 24h led to a dose dependent increase of cell proliferation. Metformin also promoted osteoblastic differentiation: it increased type I collagen production in both cell lines and stimulated alkaline phosphatase activity in MC3T31 osteoblasts. In addition, metformin markedly increased the formation of nodules of mineralization in 3 week MC3T3E1 cultures. Metformin induced activation and redistribution of phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase (P ERK) in a transient manner, and dose dependently stimulated the expression of endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthases (e/iNOS). These results show for the first time a direct osteogenic effect of metformin on osteoblasts in culture, which could be mediated by activation/redistribution of ERK 1/2 and induction of e/ NOS.(c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Studies have demonstrated the important role of bone remodelling and osteoimmunology in the progression of inflammatory lesions in axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) disease. This study was conducted to evaluate the inflammatory response by analysis of the serum levels of pro inflammatory and new bone formation markers in patients with axial SpA who were treated or not treated with anti tumour necrosis factor alpha(anti TNF alpha) or non steroidal drugs (NSAIDs) and to identify whether these drugs modify the activity and severity of the disease. The serum levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), adenosine deaminase (ADA), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), Dickkopf 1 (DKK 1), and osteoprotegerin (OP) were measured in 52 SpA patients who were treated or not with anti TNF alpha or NSAIDs and in 26 healthy controls using colourimetric and enzyme immunoassay tests. The activity and the severity of illness in patients with SpA were assessed using questionnaires (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)). A significant difference between the controls and the patients without medication was observed in relation to NOx, BAP, and OP (p < 0.01). When the patients were compared with regard to their treatment, there were no clinically significant differences between the groups (p > 0.05). In conclusion, The NOx, BAP, and OP are emerging as important inflammatory pathways in axial SpA. Also the anti TNF alpha or non steroidal drugs reduce the inflammation and destructions, however these treatments do not modify the serum levels of these biomarkers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Er xian Decoction (EXD) is a well known prescription widely used to prevent and treat climacteric syndrome and osteoporosis in China. BK channel positively affects osteoblast bone formation in vitro. However, it is still unclear whether the effect of EXD on promoting osteoblasts osteogenic differentiation is related to BK channel.Aim of the study: The study is aimed at determining whether the EXD containing serum promotes the proliferation of osteoblasts and their differentiation through BK channel.Materials and methods: The chemical compounds of EXD were analyzed by UPLC Q TOF/MS. An osteogenic in duction medium (OM) was used to induce MC3T3 E1 cells' osteogenic differentiation. The effects of EXD containing serum and tetraethylammonium (TEA) on the proliferation activity of Mc3t3 e1 cells were detec ted by CCK 8 assay. ALP activity was determined by an alkaline phosphatase kit. The protein expression (BMP2, OPG, and COL1) was analyzed by Western blot, and the mRNA expression (Runx2, OPG, and BMP2) was assessed by real time PCR. Alizarin red was used to stain the mineralized region of osteoblasts. In addition, we analyzed the relationship between BK channel and its downstream PTEN/Akt/Foxo1 signaling pathway.Results: 72 compounds were identified by UPLC Q TOF/MS analysis in EXD. Mangiferin, ferulic acid, berberine, and icariin were main active components of EXD. EXD containing serum could enhance the cell viability of MC3T3 E1 cells by decreasing the expression of BK alpha protein. EXD containing serum increased ALP activity and calcium nodule formation of Mc3t3 e1 cells, promoted the protein expression of BK alpha, COL1, BMP2, OPG, and the mRNA expression of RUNX2, OPG, and BMP2, however, these effects can be reversed after adding TEA. In addition, EXD containing serum could upregulate phosphorylation of Akt and Foxo1 in osteogenic induced Mc3t3 e1 cells, and lower the expression of PTEN. And these effects of EXD containing serum could be reduced by TEA.Conclusions: The effect of EXD containing serum on promoting cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of Mc3t3 e1 cells might be linked to the regulation of BK channel.

AB Background. Hyperparathyroidism (H PT) is an essential contributor to bone disease and cardiovascular calcifications in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Pharmacological and dietary interventions are of limited efficacy; calcimimetics are not yet recommended in children. Parathyroidectomy (PTX) is ultimately performed if HPT becomes refractory to conservative measures; the long term results and the impact of subsequent kidney transplantation (NTX), however, have not yet been evaluated.
   Methods. We analyzed the postsurgical course of 18 paediatric CKD patients with refractory HPT who underwent PTX and autotransplantation of tissue fragments. PTX was successful in all but one patient with an ectopic fifth gland; median follow up time was 8.3 (range 2.8 19) years.
   Results. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) dropped within 1 year after PTX from 1030 +/  108 to 98 +/  18 pg/ml, Ca*P from 59.5 +/  3 to 49 +/  2 mg(2)/dl(2). Oral calcium supply transiently increased from 18.7 +/  4.2 to 24.1 +/  4.8 mg/kg/day within the first 6 months (all P < 0.05). Haemoglobin increased from 10.7 +/  0.4 to 11.5 +/  0.3 g/dl (P < 0.01), despite similar erythropoietin dose and ferritin levels. In patients on long term dialysis, Ca*P increased again after 18 months; three patients required a second PTX after 3.8, 12 and 12.3 years. Twelve patients underwent NTX 1.8 (0.3 3.8) years after PTX, which decreased mean PTH and Ca*P into the target range throughout the entire post NTX observation period. Postoperative complications included one transient recurrent nerve palsy, one hypocalcaemic seizure and a case of haemopericardium. At present, no patient has clinical signs of bone disease.
   Conclusions. PTX accomplishes long term control of HPT and calcium phosphate metabolism in children with CKD and following PTX and may thus mitigate uraemic bone and cardiovascular disease. This has to be taken into account if alternative long term therapy with calcimimetics (with as yet unknown effects on longitudinal growth and pubertal development) is considered.

AB The positive effectsof the sex hormone in sustaining bone homeostasis areexercised by maintaining the equilibrium betweencell activity and apoptosis. In this regard, the importance of estrogen receptors in maintaining the bone is that it is anattractive drug target,if devoid of known side effects. In this study, we show that a natural pure compound Azadirachtin A (Aza A) isolated from Azadirachta indica binds selectively to a site in the estrogen receptor, identifying itself to bea selective tissue modifier. Using computational and medicinal chemistry, we show that Aza A binds potentially and selectively to estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) as compared with ER beta. This preferential binding of Aza A to ER alpha with good pharmacokinetic distribution in the body forms metabolites, showing that it is well absorbed. In in vivo estrogen deficiency models for osteoporosis, Aza A at a much lower dose enhances new bone formation at both sites of the trabecular and cortical bone with increased bone strength and presentswith no hyperplastic effect in the uterus.

AB Aims Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are related conditions with an increasing incidence. The mechanism of their relationship remains undefined. Here, we aimed to explore the potential mechanisms, diagnostic markers, and therapeutic options for HFpEF and NAFLD.
   Methods and results HFpEF and NAFLD datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened for functional annotation. A protein protein interaction network was constructed based on the STRING database, and hub genes were analysed using GeneMANIA annotation. ImmuCellAl (Immune Cell Abundance Identifier) was employed for analysis of immune infiltration. We also used validation datasets to validate the expression levels of hub genes and the correlation of immune cells. To screen for diagnostic biomarkers, we employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and support vector machine recursive feature elimination. Drug signature database was used to predict potential therapeutic drugs. Our analyses identified a total of 33 DEGs. Inflammation and immune infiltration played important roles in the development of both diseases. The data showed a close relationship between chemokine signalling pathway, cytokine cytokine receptor interaction, calcium signalling pathway, neuroactive ligand receptor interaction, osteoclast differentiation, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate protein kinase G signalling pathway. We demonstrated that PRF1 (perforin 1) and IL2RB (interleukin 2 receptor subunit beta) proteins were perturbed by the diseases and may be the hub genes. The analysis showed that miR 375 may be a potential diagnostic marker for both diseases. Our drug prediction analysis showed that bosentan, eldecalcitol, ramipril, and probucol could be potential therapeutic options for the diseases.
   Conclusions Our findings revealed common pathogenesis, diagnostic markers, and therapeutic agents for HFpEF and NAFLD. There is need for further experimental studies to validate our findings.

AB Critical bone defects are the result of traumatic, infection or tumor induced segmental bone loss and represent a therapeutic problem that has not been solved by current reconstructive or regenerative strate gies yet. Scaffolds functionalized with naturally occurring bioactive factor mixtures show a promising chemotactic and angiogenic potential in vitro and therefore might stimulate bone regeneration in vivo. To assess this prospect, the study targets at heparin modified mineralized collagen scaffolds functionalized with naturally occurring bioactive factor mixtures and/or rhBMP 2. These scaffolds were implanted into a 2 mm segmental femoral defect in mice and analyzed in respect to newly formed bone volume (BV) and bone mineral density (BMD) by micro computed tomography scans after an observation period of 6 weeks. To rate the degree of defect healing, the number of vessels, and the activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts were analyzed histologically. The sole application of bioactive factor mixtures is inferior to the use of the recombinant growth factor rhBMP 2 regarding BV and degree of defect healing. A higher rhBMP 2 concentration or the combination with bioactive factor mixtures does not lead to a further en hancement in defect healing. Possibly, a synergistic effect can be achieved by further concentration or a prolonged release of bioactive factor mixtures.Statement of significance The successful therapy of extended bone defects is still a major challenge in clinical routine. In this study we investigated the bone regenerative potential of naturally occuring bioactive factor mixtures de rived from platelet concentrates, adipose tissue and cell secretomes as a cheap and promising alternative to recombinant growth factors in a murine segmental bone defect model. The mixtures alone were not able to induce complete bridging of the bone defect, but in combination with bone morphogenetic pro tein 2 bone healing seemed to be more physiological. The results show that naturally occuring bioactive factor mixtures are a promising add on in a clinical setting.(c) 2022 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To investigate the mechanism by which melatonin inhibits mouse chondrocyte hypertrophy and osteoarthritis by inhibiting SiK3 activation of the WNT pathway. Methods: Thirty clean C57BL/6 male mice were randomly divided into three groups. The hind limb joints of the mice were isolated under aseptic conditions. Mouse chondrocytes were isolated from the hind limb joints of each group of mice, and a mouse osteoarthritis model was established. Group B (blank control group), Group O (osteoarthritis group), and Group M (osteoarthritis + melatonin group) were set, and 8 sub wells were set in each group. The expression of SiK3 gene mRNA was detected by real time fluorescent quantitative PCR. The expression of SiK3 gene was determined by ELISA. The expression of SiK3 protein was detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: Compared with Group B mice, the chondrocytes of mice in Group O and Group M were significantly hypertrophied, and the hypertrophy of mice in group M with melatonin was significantly slower than that of mice in Group O (P<0.01); compared with group B and group O, the expression of SiK3 gene in group M mice had a significant downward trend (P<0.01); compared with Group B and Group O, the protein expression of SiK3 was significantly down regulated in M group (P<0.01). After adding melatonin, the WNT signaling pathway was activated, and the release of neurotransmitters in group M was significantly increased and the area was increased compared with Group B and Group O. Conclusion: Melatonin could inhibit the activation of SiK3 to inhibit mouse chondrocyte hypertrophy and osteoarthritis, which was accomplished by activating the WNT pathway.

AB Pharmacodynamics (PD) similarity is an important component to support the claim of similarity between two drugs or devices. This article investigates the trial design and statistical considerations in the equivalence test of PD endpoints. Using bone resorption marker CTX as a case study, the relationship between the PD readouts and drug potency was explored to evaluate the sensitivity of the PD endpoint and guide equivalence margin selection. For PD data that have high baseline variability, one conventional similarity assessment method was to apply baseline normalization followed by the standard bioequivalence (BE) test (Lancet Haematol. 4:e350 61, 2017, Ann Rheum Dis. 2017). This study showcased the drawbacks of the conventional method for PD data that were close to inhibition saturation, as the baseline normalization significantly skewed the distribution of the PD data toward non log normal. In such cases, the standard BE test can produce an inflated type I error. Alternatively, ANCOVA, when applied to the un normalized PD data with the baseline as a covariate, produced a satisfactory type I error with sufficient power. Therefore, ANCOVA was recommended for equivalence test of PD markers that has a saturated inhibition profile and high variability at baseline. Moreover, the relationship between PD readouts and drug potency was used to explore the sensitivity of the PD endpoint and it could help justify the equivalence margins, since the standard 80% to 125% BE margin often does not apply to PD. Finally, a decision tree was proposed to help guide the design of the PD equivalence study in the choice of PD endpoints and statistical methods.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Despite widespread use of herbal remedies for treating arthritis and osteosarcoma, many plants are still not pharmacologically evaluated for their efficacy. Contrary to many non steroidal, immunosuppressants, antibiotics, and antineoplastic drugs that have adverse effects, phytotherapeutic compounds have promising benefits with fewer complications. In this study the unexplored Northeastern India indigenous plant Trevesia palmata (Roxb. ex Lindl.) Vis. used in traditional medicine to cure bone fractures is chosen for studying anti proliferative and anti rheumatic properties.
   Aim of the study: This study designed to explore the polyphenolic composition, antioxidant, anti inflammatory and anti arthritic potential of T. palmata leaf extracts. Further, the cellular activity was studied using MG 63 osteoblast cell lines and pharmacologically evaluated using Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) induced arthritic rat model.
   Materials and methods: In vitro free radical scavenging activity, anti inflammatory and anti arthritic activities of extracts were analyzed using standardized methods. The polyphenolic profiling and apoptosis inducing ability of T. palmata ethyl acetate (TPEA) extract on MG 63 osteoblast cell lines were analyzed. The in vivo pharmacological studies were carried out with low dose 250 mg/kg and high dose of 500 mg/kg of T. palmata. The biochemical and haematological parameters and in vivo antioxidant activity were evaluated for the control and treated groups. Radiological and histological study were done to understand the impact and penetration of inflammatory arthritis from tissues to joint bones.
   Results: TPEA showed highest free radical scavenging activity (DPPH   4.72 IC50, ABTS   242.33 +/  6.81 mM TE/g extract), anti inflammatory (40.04% inhibition of RBC lysis) and anti arthritic activity (32.4% inhibition of protein denaturation) with the presence of gallic acid, catechin, caffeic acid, rutin, quercetin and naringenin. The TPEA extract inhibited cell proliferation of MG 63 osteoblast cells and induced apoptosis by arresting cell cycle at different phases. After acute toxicity studies the doses 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg were fixed and showed better results in CFA induced arthritic animals. Thus, the extract phytoconstituents may have immense potential against chronic inflammation, joint ailments, bone cancer and arthritis which serves as a phytomedicine contrary to synthetic medications.
   Conclusions: The potential treatment of polyphenolic compounds in the T. palmata extract on osteosarcoma and arthritis was demonstrated from this study. Thus, cellular inflammatory infiltrates are significantly reduced in bone and joint tissues as well.

AB Resveratrol shows potent anti tumor therapeutic properties in various tumors. However, the exact effect of resveratrol on osteosarcoma cells, especially cancer stem cells, remains unclear. In this study, we examined the effect of resveratrol on osteosarcoma stem cells and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. Resveratrol inhibited cell viability, self renewal ability and tumorigenesis of osteosarcoma cells, whereas showed no significant inhibition effects to normal osteoblast cells. Mechanically, resveratrol treatment decreased cytokines synthesis and inhibited JAK2/STAT3 signaling, which was consistent with the decline of cancer stem cells marker, CD133. Exogenous STAT3 activation attenuated the cancer stem cell elimination effects of resveratrol treatment. Our results demonstrated that resveratrol inhibited osteosarcoma cell proliferation and tumorigenesis ability, which was correlated with cytokines inhibition related JAK2/STAT3 signaling blockage. Resveratrol may be a promising therapeutic agent for osteosarcoma management.

AB Human linkage studies suggest that craniofacial deformities result from either genetic mutations related to cholesterol metabolism or high cholesterol maternal diets. However, little is known about the precise roles of intracellular cholesterol metabolism in the development of craniofacial bones, the majority of which are formed through intramembranous ossification. Here, we show that an altered cholesterol metabolic status results in abnormal osteogenesis through dysregulation of primary cilium formation during bone formation. We found that cholesterol metabolic aberrations, induced through disruption of either Dhcr7 (which encodes an enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis) or Insig1 and Insig2 (which provide a negative feedback mechanism for cholesterol biosynthesis), result in osteoblast differentiation abnormalities. Notably, the primary cilia responsible for sensing extracellular cues were altered in number and length through dysregulated ciliary vesicle fusion in Dhcr7 and Insig1/2 mutant osteoblasts. As a consequence, WNT/beta catenin and hedgehog signaling activities were altered through dysregulated primary cilium formation. Strikingly, the normalization of defective cholesterol metabolism by simvastatin, a drug used in the treatment of cholesterol metabolic aberrations, rescued the abnormalities in both ciliogenesis and osteogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our results indicate that proper intracellular cholesterol status is crucial for primary cilium formation during skull formation and homeostasis.

AB Purpose: The clinical use of the potent bisphosphonate zoledronic acid has increased recently, especially for the treatment of bone metastases. Synergistic effects with chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., doxorubicin, paclitaxel) have been shown. It is not known whether similar synergistic effects exist with radiation.
   Methods and Materials: IM 9 myeloma cells and C4 2 prostate cancer cells were treated with up to 200 muM concentrations of zoledronic acid, irradiated with single doses of up to 1,000 cGy, or exposed to combinations of both treatments. Cell viability was then determined via yellow dye 3 [4,5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl] 2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and the affected fractions analyzed using the median effect principal, a method developed and validated by Chou and Talalay.
   Results: A statistically significant synergistic cytotoxic effect of the combination of zoledronic acid and radiation was documented. The extent of the effect was cell type dependent, with the C4 2 cells showing a greater synergistic effect than the IM 9 cells.
   Conclusions: The combined use of zoledronic acid and radiotherapy shows enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity for two human prostate and myeloma cancer cell lines over that expected for a simple additive effect from each treatment alone. A clinical trial is under way to test this combination therapy. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an extremely painful autoimmune disease characterized by chronic joint inflammation leading to the erosion of adjacent cartilage and bone. Rheumatoid arthritis pathology is primarily driven by inappropriate infiltration and activation of immune cells within the synovium of the joint. There is no cure for RA. As such, manifestation of symptoms entails lifelong management via various therapies that aim to generally dampen the immune system or impede the function of immune mediators. However, these treatment strategies lead to adverse effects such as toxicity, general immunosuppression, and increased risk of infection. In pursuit of safer and more efficacious therapies, many emerging biomaterial based strategies are being developed to improve payload delivery, specific targeting, and dose efficacy, and to mitigate adverse reactions and toxicity. In this review, we highlight biomaterial based approaches that are currently under investigation to circumvent the limitations of conventional RA treatments.

AB Background: Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are pluripotent cells with the ability to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. BMSCs are widely used in regenerative medicine and cartilage tissue engineering. Role of lncRNA LRRC75A AS1 (leucine rich repeat containing 75A antisense RNA 1) in the chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs was investigated in this study.
   Methods: BMSCs were isolated from rat bone marrow and then identified using flow cytometry. Alcian blue staining was used to detect chondrogenic differentiation. The effect of LRRC75A AS1 on chondrogenic differentiation was assessed by western blot. The downstream target of LRRC75A AS1 was determined by dual luciferase activity assay.
   Results: BMSCs were identified with positive CD29 and CD44 staining and negative staining of CD34 and CD45. LRRC75A AS1 was decreased during the chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Silencing of LRRC75A AS1 increased collagen II (COL II), aggrecan and SOX9 and promoted chondrogenic differentiation. However, over expression of LRRC75A AS1 inhibited chondrogenic differentiation. miR140 3p was increased during chondrogenic differentiation and interacted with LRRC75A AS1. miR 1403p bind to wnt3a, and inhibition of miR 140 3p up regulated wnt3a and nuclear beta  catenin expression. Wnt3a and nuclear beta catenin were decreased during chondrogenic differentiation. Inhibition of miR 1403p attenuated LRRC75A AS1 deficiency induced up regulation of COL II, aggrecan and SOX9.
   Conclusion: LRRC75A AS1 suppressed chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs through down regulation of miR 140 3p and up regulation of the wnt/beta catenin pathway.

AB Osteosarcoma is the most common bone cancer in children and adolescents with a 5 year survival rate of about 70%. In this study, we have evaluated the preclinical therapeutic efficacy of the novel synthetic drug, Minnelide, a prodrug of triptolide on osteosarcoma. Triptolide was effective in significantly inducing apoptosis in all osteosarcoma cell lines tested but had no significant effect on the human osteoblast cells. Notably, Minnelide treatment significantly reduced tumor burden and lung metastasis in the orthotopic and lung colonization models. Triptolide/Minnelide effectively downregulated the levels of pro survival proteins such as heat shock proteins, cMYC, survivin and targets the NF kappa B pathway. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Bone is one of the most common sites of metastasis in patients with advanced breast cancer; however, the mechanisms of bone metastasis remain to be fully elucidated. Animal models are essential research tools for investigating the mechanisms of diseases and drug actions. To date, there have only been a few reports in which C57BL/6 mice were used for the study of bone metastases of breast cancer. In the current study, we found that intracardiac inoculation of C57BL/6 mouse derived parental E0771 breast cancer cells (E0771/Pa) frequently lead to bone metastases in C57BL/6 mice within 2weeks. The bone metastatic clone of E0771 (E0771/Bone) established by sequential in vivo selection demonstrated a higher bone metastatic potential. Although there were no apparent differences in cell morphology or proliferation in monolayer cultures, E0771/Bone showed increased tumorsphere formation in suspension cultures and tumor formation in the orthotopic mammary fat pad in C57BL/6 mice compared with E0771/Pa. Furthermore, E0771/Bone expressed breast cancer stem like cell surface markers CD24( )/CD44(+). These findings suggest that E0771/Bone possesses cancer stem like properties. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that mRNA expression of parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP), the most common mediator of osteolytic bone metastases of breast cancer, was significantly upregulated in E0771/Bone. Thus, cancer stem like properties and elevated PTHrP expression likely contribute to the enhanced metastatic potential of E0771/Bone. We believe that this new mouse model is a useful tool for in vivo studies of bone metastases of breast cancer, especially for those using genetically engineered mice with a C57BL/6 background.

AB Aim: Cynomorium songaricum Rupr., an edible and important Traditional Chinese medicine has long been used in folk for treatment of kidney deficiency, was chosen to estimate the antiosteoporotic activity and underlying molecular mechanism on rats induced by ovariectomy (OVX).
   Main methods: 9 of 45 rats were underwent bilateral laparotomy without removing the ovaries as sham group, remains were underwent bilateral ovariectomy and equally randomized into four groups: with vehicle (0.5% CMC Na) as model group, estradiol valerate (1 mg/kg body weight/day) as positive control, with 100 and 300 mg/kg body weight/day of ethanol extracts of C. songaricum extract (CSE) as low and high dosage groups, respectively.
   Key findings: After 12 weeks of continues orally intervention, the decreases of bone mineral density, bone mineral content, tissue mineral content, as well as the increases of bone trabecular separation and bone resorption markers were significantly reversed by CSE in the OVX rats, and in particular, a contradictory phenomenon on calcium and phosphorus contents was observed and elucidated. Mechanistically, the expressions of tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF 6), nuclear factor kappa B (RANK) and its ligand (RANKL), as well as the nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B), phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT) levels were significantly down regulated by CSE intervention, whereas the osteoprotegerin (OPG) was significantly upregulated by CSE as compared to the control.
   Significance: Concisely, C. songaricum exhibited potential therapeutic effect on bone metabolism of ovariectomized rats, and this effect was possibly exerted by RANKL/RANK/TRAF6 mediated down regulation of NF kappa B and PI3K/AKT pathways.

AB Osteoclasts (OCs) are large multinucleated cells derived from progenitor cells of the monocyte macrophage lineage. Signal transduction via the macrophage colony stimulating factor (M CSF) receptor, c fms, is essential for OC formation. Since we have previously demonstrated inhibition of c fms by imatinib, we examined the effect of imatinib on OC formation and activity. OC formation was not affected by concentrations of 1.0 mu M imatinib and lower, but was reduced by 75% at 3.0 mu M imatinib. In contrast, both the area of resorption and the number of resorption lacunae were reduced by 80% at 0.3 mu M imatinib, and no resorption was observed at concentrations above 3.0 mu M. A dose dependent decrease in receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK) expression was observed in OCs when cultured in the presence of imatinib, providing a mechanism for the decrease in OC function. In vivo analysis of the effect of imatinib on OC activity in adult mice following 8 weeks of imatinib treatment also demonstrated a decrease in OC activity. These results suggest that imatinib may have therapeutic value as an antiosteolytic agent in diseases such as osteoporosis, metastatic bone disease, and multiple myeloma.

AB Background: Osteosarcoma (OSA) spontaneously arises in the appendicular skeleton of large breed dogs and shares many physiological and molecular biological characteristics with human OSA. The standard treatment for OSA in both species is amputation or limb sparing surgery, followed by chemotherapy. Unfortunately, OSA is an aggressive cancer with a high metastatic rate. Characterization of OSA with regard to its metastatic potential and chemotherapeutic resistance will improve both prognostic capabilities and treatment modalities.
   Methods: We analyzed archived primary OSA tissue from dogs treated with limb amputation followed by doxorubicin or platinum based drug chemotherapy. Samples were selected from two groups: dogs with disease free intervals (DFI) of less than 100 days (n = 8) and greater than 300 days (n = 7). Gene expression was assessed with Affymetrix Canine 2.0 microarrays and analyzed with a two tailed t test. A subset of genes was confirmed using qRT PCR and used in classification analysis to predict prognosis. Systems based gene ontology analysis was conducted on genes selected using a standard J5 metric. The genes identified using this approach were converted to their human homologues and assigned to functional pathways using the GeneGo MetaCore platform.
   Results: Potential biomarkers were identified using gene expression microarray analysis and 11 differentially expressed (p < 0.05) genes were validated with qRT PCR (n = 10/group). Statistical classification models using the qRT PCR profiles predicted patient outcomes with 100% accuracy in the training set and up to 90% accuracy upon stratified cross validation. Pathway analysis revealed alterations in pathways associated with oxidative phosphorylation, hedgehog and parathyroid hormone signaling, cAMP/Protein Kinase A (PKA) signaling, immune responses, cytoskeletal remodeling and focal adhesion.
   Conclusions: This profiling study has identified potential new biomarkers to predict patient outcome in OSA and new pathways that may be targeted for therapeutic intervention.

AB Ultrasound, or the application of acoustic energy, is a minimally invasive technique that has been used in diagnostic, surgical, imaging, and therapeutic applications. Low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has been used to accelerate bone fracture repair and to heal non union defects. While shown to be effective the precise mechanism behind its utility is still poorly understood. In this study, we considered the possibility that LIPUS may be providing a physical stimulus to cells within bony defects. We have also evaluated ultrasound as a means of producing a transdermal physical force that could stimulate osteoblasts that had been encapsulated within collagen hydrogels and delivered to bony defects. Here we show that ultrasound does indeed produce a measurable physical force and when applied to hydrogels causes their deformation, more so as ultrasound intensity was increased or hydrogel stiffness decreased. MC3T3 mouse osteoblast cells were then encapsulated within hydrogels to measure the response to this force. Statistically significant elevated gene expression for alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, both well established markers of osteoblast differentiation, was noted in encapsulated osteoblasts (p<0.05), suggesting that the physical force provided by ultrasound may induce bone formation in part through physically stimulating cells. We have also shown that this osteoblastic response is dependent in part on the stiffness of the encapsulating hydrogel, as stiffer hydrogels resulted in reducing or reversing this response. Taken together this approach, encapsulating cells for implantation into a bony defect that can potentially be transdermally loaded using ultrasound presents a novel regenerative engineering approach to enhanced fracture repair.

AB Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) is a widely used autologous blood concentrate in regenerative medicine. This study aimed to characterize the cellular composition and distribution of different PRF matrices generated by high (710 g) and low (44 g) relative centrifugal forces (RCFs) and to analyze their bioactivity on human primary osteoblasts (pOBs). PRF was separated into upper layer (UL) and buffy coat (BC) fractions, and their cellular contents were assessed using histological and immunohistochemical staining. The release of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF beta) was quantified using an ELISA. Indirect PRF treatment on pOBs was performed to evaluate cell viability and morphology. A histological analysis revealed higher quantities of leukocytes and platelets in the low RCF PRF. TGF beta release was significantly higher in the low RCF PRF compared to the high RCF PRF. All PRF fractions promoted pOB proliferation regardless of the centrifugation protocol used. The low RCF PRF showed higher TGF beta levels than the high RCF PRF. These findings contribute to understanding the cellular mechanisms of PRF and provide insights into optimizing PRF protocols for bone regeneration, advancing regenerative medicine, and improving patient outcomes.

AB Introduction: Limited evidence exists on health system characteristics associated with initial and long term prescribing of opioids and nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) following total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA), and if these characteristics differ among individuals based on preoperative NSAID exposure. We identified orthopedic surgeon opioid prescribing practices, hospital characteristics, and regional factors associated with initial and long term prescribing of opioids and NSAIDs among older adults receiving THA/TKA. Materials and Methods: This observational study included opioid na & iuml;ve Medicare beneficiaries aged >= 65 years receiving elective THA/TKA between January 1, 2014 and July 4, 2017. We examined initial (days 1 30 following THA/TKA) and long term (days 90 180) opioid or NSAID prescribing, stratified by preoperative NSAID exposure. Risk ratios (RRs) for the associations between 10 health system characteristics and case mix adjusted outcomes were estimated using multivariable Poisson regression models. Results: The study population included 23,351 NSAID na & iuml;ve and 10,127 NSAID prevalent individuals. Increases in standardized measures of orthopedic surgeon opioid prescribing generally decreased the risk of initial NSAID prescribing but increased the risk of long term opioid prescribing. For example, among NSAID na & iuml;ve individuals, the RRs (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for initial NSAID prescribing were 0.95 (0.93 0.97) for 1 2 orthopedic surgeon opioid prescriptions per THA/TKA procedure, 0.94 (0.92 0.97) for 3 4 prescriptions per procedure, and 0.91 (0.89 0.93) for 5+ opioid prescriptions per procedure (reference: <1 opioid prescription per procedure), while the RRs (95% CIs) for long term opioid prescribing were 1.06 (1.04 1.08), 1.08 (1.06 1.11), and 1.13 (1.11 1.16), respectively. Variation in postoperative analgesic prescribing was observed across U.S. regions. For example, among NSAID na & iuml;ve individuals, the RR (95% CIs) for initial opioid prescribing were 0.98 (0.96 1.00) for Region 2 (New York), 1.09 (1.07 1.11) for Region 3 (Philadelphia), 1.07 (1.05 1.10) for Region 4 (Atlanta), 1.03 (1.01 1.05) for Region 5 (Chicago), 1.16 (1.13 1.18) for Region 6 (Dallas), 1.10 (1.08 1.12) for Region 7 (Kansas City), 1.09 (1.06 1.12) for Region 8 (Denver), 1.09 (1.07 1.12) for Region 9 (San Francisco), and 1.11 (1.08 1.13) for Region 10 (Seattle) (reference: Region 1 [Boston]). Hospital characteristics were not meaningfully associated with postoperative analgesic prescribing. The relationships between health system characteristics and postoperative analgesic prescribing were similar for NSAID na & iuml;ve and NSAID prevalent participants. Discussion: Future efforts aiming to improve the use of multimodal analgesia through increased NSAID prescribing and reduced long term opioid prescribing following THA/TKA could consider targeting orthopedic surgeons with higher standardized opioid prescribing measures. Conclusions: Orthopedic surgeon opioid prescribing measures and U.S. region were the greatest health system level predictors of initial, and long term, prescribing of opioids and prescription NSAIDs among older Medicare beneficiaries following THA/TKA. These results can inform future studies that examine why variation in analgesic prescribing exists across geographic regions and levels of orthopedic surgeon opioid prescribing.

AB We evaluated the improvement of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels and bone parameters by supplementing nutritional vitamin D (cholecalciferol) to combined calcimimetic (cinacalcet) and active vitamin D analog (calcitriol) among severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) hemodialysis (HD) patients. A randomized, controlled open label study was undertaken in 60 HD patients with serum iPTH > 1000 pg/mL or persistently high iPTH 600 pg/mL even after >3 months of calcitriol (3 g/week). The study group received oral cholecalciferol (5000 IU/ day) and the control group received a placebo. All patients received fixed dose cinacalcet (30 mg/day, orally) and calcitriol. Calcitriol was reduced if iPTH 300 pg/mL and cinacalcet was withdrawn if serum iPTH was persistently low (iPTH 300 pg/mL) for 4 weeks after the reduction of calcitriol. A significantly lower iPTH level was noted from the 20th week in the study group compared to the placebo group, and the target iPTH 300 pg/mL was achieved at the 24th week in the study group. Most patients achieved serum 25 (OH)D 3 30 ng/mL in the study group. Nearly 40% of study patients gained >10% improvement in femoral neck (FN) bone mineral density (BMD). We conclude that cholecalciferol additively reduced serum iPTH levels, improved 25 (OH)D 3 levels and improved FN BMD when used together with cinacalcet/calcitriol in severe SHPT HD patients.

AB Rosette nanotubes (RNTs) are novel, self assembled, biomimetic, synthetic drug delivery materials suitable for numerous medical applications. Because of their amphiphilic character and hollow architecture, RNTs can be used to encapsulate and deliver hydrophobic drugs otherwise difficult to deliver in biological systems. Another advantage of using RNTs for drug delivery is their biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, and their ability to engender a favorable, biologically inspired environment for cell adhesion and growth. In this study, a method to incorporate dexamethasone (DEX, an inflammatory and a bone growth promoting steroid) into RNTs was developed. The drug loaded RNTs were characterized using diffusion ordered nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (DOSY NMR) and UV Vis spectroscopy. Results showed for the first time that DEX can be easily and quickly encapsulated into RNTs and released to promote osteoblast (bone forming cell) functions over long periods of time. As a result, RNTs are presented as a novel material for the targeted delivery of hydrophobic drugs otherwise difficult to deliver.

AB Black Americans have lower levels of serum 25(OH)D but superior bone health compared to white Americans. There is controversy over whether they should be screened for vitamin D deficiency and have higher vitamin D requirements than recommended by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). The purpose of this trial was to determine whether Vitamin D supplementation in elderly black women prevents bone loss. A total of 260 healthy black American women, 60 years of age and older were recruited to take part in a two arm, double dummy 3 year randomized controlled trial (RCT) of vitamin D 3 versus placebo. The study was conducted in an ambulatory clinical research center. Vitamin D 3 dose was adjusted to maintain serum 25(OH)D above 75 nmol/L. Bone mineral density (BMD) and serum were measured for parathyroid hormone (PTH), C terminal crosslink telopeptide (CTX), and bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) every 6 months. Baseline serum 25(OH)D 3 was 54.8 +/  16.8 nmol/L. There was no group x time interaction effect for any BMD measurement. For all BMD measurements, except for total body and spine, there was a statistically significant negative effect of time (p < 0.001). An equivalency analysis showed that the treatment group was equivalent to the control group. Serum PTH and BSAP declined, with a greater decline of PTH in the treatment group. The rate of bone loss with serum 25(OH)D above 75 nmol/L is comparable to the rate of loss with serum 25(OH)D at the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 50 nmol/L. Black Americans should have the same exposure to vitamin D as white Americans. (c) 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB Bone derived transforming growth factor (TGF) beta 1 leads to tumor growth, osteoblastic lesions and more invasion. Degradation of basement membranes caused by cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 is known as a distinctive feature of invasive cells. We investigated inhibition of COX 2 with NS398 in PC 3 and LNCaP cell lines. TGF beta 1 and dmPGE2 were added in NS398 treated or untreated cells. COX 2 did not express in PC 3, after treatment with TGF beta 1, COX 2 appeared and accompanied with enhanced invasion. COX 2 expressed in LNCaP, undetectable after addition of NS398 along with decreased invasion. Addition of TGF beta 1 reversed inhibition of NS398 in both cell lines. DmPGE2 augmented invasion in both cell lines without alteration of COX 2. These results suggest that TGF beta 1 can increase invasion and reverse inhibition of COX 2 induced by NS398. We indicate that bone derived TGF beta 1 might contribute to clinical unsatisfied effect of NSAIDs or COX 2 specific inhibitors adjuvant therapies. Our data provide a new potential therapy for fighting against prostate cancer.

AB Purpose: Inhibitors of protein prenylation, including prenyltransferase inhibitors and aminobisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid, are being investigated intensively as therapeutics in cancer and other diseases. Determining whether prenylation inhibitors directly or indirectly target tumor and/or host cells is key to understanding therapeutic mechanisms.
   Experimental Design: To determine which cell types can be targeted directly by distinct classes of prenylation inhibitors in vivo, we describe herein the development and implementation of a sensitive and pharmacologically specific bioluminescence based imaging reporter that is inducible by prenylation inhibitors.
   Results: In mouse xenograft models of breast cancer, using reporter bearing mammary fat pad  or bone localized tumor cells, we show that a prenyltransferase inhibitor robustly induces reporter activity in vivo. In contrast, zoledronic acid, a bone associated aminobisphosphonate that exerts adjuvant chemotherapeutic activity in patients with breast cancer, fails to induce reporter activity in tumor cells of either model.
   Conclusions: Although a prenyltransferase inhibitor can directly target breast cancer cells in vivo, zoledronic acid and related aminobisphosphonates are likely to exert antitumor activity indirectly by targeting host cells. Accordingly, these findings shift attention toward the goal of determining which host cell types are targeted directly by aminobisphosphonates to exert adjuvant chemotherapeutic activity.

TI Targeting syndecan 1 in breast cancer inhibits osteoclast functions
   through up regulation of osteoprotegerin

AB Background: Breast cancer often metastasizes into bone and leads to osteolytic lesions. The underlying mechanisms, however, are complex and not fully understood. Syndecan 1 is a proteoglycan that has various functions relevant for tumor progression including cell cell communication and cell matrix interactions. Moreover, its two glycosaminoglycan binding sites suggest that it may interfere with glycoproteins such as osteoprotegerin, a potent inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis. Thus, we hypothesize that tumor derived syndecan 1 alters osteoclast biology by modulating osteoprotegerin.
   Methods: Syndecan 1 expression was down regulated via siRNA and the cell fare of the breast cancer cell lines MCF 7, T 47D, and MDA MB 231 was investigated. Furthermore, we determined the regulation of syndecan 1 by dexamethasone, a commonly used antiemetic in breast cancer therapy. Additionally, we analyzed the genesis and activity of osthoclasts in indirect co culture experiments using supernatants from MCF 7 cells with deficient and sufficient levels of syndecan 1.
   Results: Dexamethasone time and close dependently increased syndecan 1 expression up to 4 fold but did not alter cell behavior. Synclecan 1 up regulation did not affect the survival or migration of breast cancer cells. Depletion of syndecan 1 using siRNA led to decreased vitality of progesterone receptor positive cell lines. In MCF 7 cells osteoprotegerin production was up regulated 2.5 fold after syndecan 1 knock down. The culture of osteoclast precursors with the supernatant of MCF 7 cells with reduced syndecan 1 levels suppressed osteoclast formation and activity by 21% and 23%, respectively. Adding neutralizing antibodies to osteoprotegerin to the breast cancer supernatants reversed osteoclastogenesis.
   Conclusion: Thus, we identified tumor derived syndecan 1 as a novel positive regulator of osteoclastogenesis and new player in the tumor bone dialog. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) engraftment after transplantation during anticancer treatment depends on support from the recipient bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Here, by studying physiological homing of fetal HSPCs, we show the critical requirement of balanced local crosstalk within the skeletal niche for successful HSPC settlement in BM. Transgene induced overproduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by osteoprogenitor cells elicits stromal and endothelial hyperactivation, profoundly impacting the stromal vessel interface and vascular architecture. Concomitantly, HSPC homing and survival are drastically impaired. Transcriptome profiling, flow cytometry, and high resolution imaging indicate alterations in perivascular and endothelial cell characteristics, vascular function and cellular metabolism, associated with increased oxidative stress within the VEGF enriched BM environment. Thus, developmental HSPC homing to bone is controlled by local stromal vascular integrity and the oxidative metabolic status of the recipient milieu. Interestingly, irradiation of adult mice also induces stromal VEGF expression and similar osteo angiogenic niche changes, underscoring that our findings may contribute targets for improving stem cell therapies.

TI Novel bisphosphonate based cathepsin K triggered compound targets the

AB Background: Osteoadsorptive fluorogenic sentinel 3 (OFS 3) is a recently described compound that contains a bone targeting bisphosphonate (BP) and cathepsin K (Ctsk) triggered fluorescence signal. A prior study in a murine Achilles repair model demonstrated its effectiveness at targeting the site of tendon to bone repair, but the intrinsic effect of this novel bisphosphonate chaperone on tendon to bone healing has not been previously explored. We hypothesized that application of this bisphosphonate fluorophore cargo conjugate would not affect the biomechanical properties or histologic appearance of tendon bone repairs.Materials and Methods: Right hindlimb Achilles tendon to bone repair was performed on 12 week old male mice. Animals were divided into 2 groups of 18 each: 1) Achilles repair with OFS 3 applied directly to the repair site prior to closure, and 2) Achilles repair with saline applied prior to closure. Repaired hindlimbs from 12 animals per group were harvested at 6 weeks for biomechanical analysis with a custom 3D printed jig. At 4 and 6 weeks, repaired hindlimbs from the remaining animals were assessed histologically using H&E, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for the presence of Ctsk, and second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging to evaluate collagen fibers.Results: At 6 weeks, there was no significant difference in failure load, stiffness, toughness, or displacement to failure between repaired hindlimbs that received OFS 3 versus saline. There was no difference in tissue healing on H&E or Ctsk staining on immunohistochemistry between animals that received OFS 3 versus saline. Finally, second harmonic generation imaging demonstrated no difference in collagen fiber parameters between the two groups.Conclusion: OFS 3 did not significantly affect the biomechanical properties or histologic appearance of murine Achilles tendon to bone repairs. This study demonstrates that OFS 3 can target the site of tendon to bone repair without causing intrinsic negative effects on healing. Further development of this drug delivery platform to target growth factors to the site of tendon bone repair is warranted.

AB The titanium dioxide drug loaded nanotube coating on titanium alloy surface was helpful to reduce the risk of infection after implantation in vivo. In this work, Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3 (marked as BCZT) with piezoelectric effect and Ag nanoparticles with antibacterial effect were introduced into the TiO2 nanotube coating, and a piezoelectric and antibacterial BCZT Ag coating was prepared on titanium surface. The drug release rate in the nanotubes was reduced by the design of the coating structure. The results showed that the Ag nanoparticles were uniformly distributed in the BCZT Ag coating. The piezoelectric coefficient of BCZT Ag2.5 coating reached 13.0 pC/N. The release of silver ions in the BCZT Ag coating showed a significant slow release trend compared with that in the TiO2 nanotube silver loaded coating. Interestingly, the antibacterial rate of polarized BCZT Ag2.5 coating reached 99% even after being immersed in simulated body fluids for 7 days. The BCZT Ag2.5 coating has no osteoblast toxicity, and osteoblasts can adhere to the BCZT Ag2.5 coating on titanium surface. The BCZTAg2.5 also shows good biological activity in the simulated body fluid immersion experiment. The results will provide a new idea and data support for the application of biological piezoelectric silver loaded coating on titanium surface in orthopedic implants.

AB Age associated decrease in nitric oxide (NO) production may be related to an increase in cardiovascular events, sexual dysfunction, and osteoporosis. Relative NO deficiency is a plausible biological basis for NO replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) enhances local NO production and rectifies NO deficiency in postmenopausal women. However, excess local production of NO aggravates bone destruction in inflammatory arthropathies. In addition to its use in alleviating angina and erectile dysfunction, NO compounds could be a valuable supplemental therapy for chronic conditions including osteoporosis. Estrogen mediates its beneficial effects in bone, in part via the NO/cGMP pathway; hence NO donor therapy is an alternative to estrogen, estrogen agonists antagonists, and androgen receptor modulator therapy in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Large numbers of animal studies and human pilot studies support the concept of using NO donors for preventing bone loss. Administration of exogenous NO or prolonging endogenous NO activity are practical ways to supplement NO.

AB Postmenopausal women experience bone loss and weight gain. To date, crosstalk between estrogen receptor signals and nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) has been reported, and estrogen depletion enhances bone resorption by osteoclasts via NF kappa B activation. However, it is unclear when and in which tissues NF kappa B is activated after menopause, and how NF kappa B acts as a common signaling molecule for postmenopausal weight gain and bone loss. Therefore, we examined the role of NF kappa B in bone and energy metabolism following menopause. NF kappa B reporter mice, which can be used to measure NF kappa B activation in vivo, were ovariectomized (OVX) and the luminescence intensity after OVX increased in the metaphyses of the long bones and perigonadal white adipose tissue, but not in the other tissues. OVX was performed on wild type (WT) and p65 mutant knock in (S534A) mice, whose mutation enhances the transcriptional activity of NF kappa B. Weight gain with worsening glucose tolerance was significant in S534A mice after OVX compared with those of WT mice. The bone density of the sham group in WT or S534A mice did not change, whereas in the S534A OVX group it significantly decreased due to the suppression of bone formation and increase in bone marrow adipocytes. Disulfiram, an anti alcoholic drug, suppressed OVXinduced activation of NF kappa B in the metaphyses of long bones and white adipose tissue (WAT), as well as weight gain and bone loss. Overall, the activation of NF kappa B in the metaphyses of long bones and WAT after OVX regulates post OVX weight gain and bone loss.

AB BackgroundCell free approaches, utilizing mesenchymal stem cell secretome, have promising prospects in various fields of regenerative medicine. In this study, we examined in vitro and in vivo the potential of dental pulp stem cell conditioned medium (DPSC CM) for bone regeneration.MethodsThe secretome of undifferentiated stem cells from dental pulp were collected, and the effects of this DPSC CM were assessed for osteodifferentiation of osteoblast like cells (MG 63) and osteoblasts deriving from DPSC. Cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, gene expression of Runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), Bone Sialoprotein (BSP), Osteocalcin (OCN), and extracellular matrix mineralization were evaluated. The rat caudal vertebrae critical size defect model was to investigate the effect of DPSC CM in vivo.ResultsResults showed that DPSC CM induced cell growth, and increased ALP activity and the expression of key marker genes at an early stage of osteoblastic differentiation compared to control. A rat bone defect model was used to illustrate the effect of DPSC CM in vivo. The bone density within the defects were improved using conditioned medium, even though there was no significant difference between the control and DPSC CM groups. The analysis of DPSC CM by human growth factor antibody array revealed the presence of several factors involved in osteogenesis.ConclusionTaken together, these findings indicate that DPSC CM is a promising therapeutic candidate for bone regenerative therapy, accelerating the maturation of osteoblastic cells. And even though safety and efficiency of DPSC CM have to be confirmed in preclinical studies, these results represent a first step toward clinical application.

AB Objective: This study aims to explore the molecular mechanism of macrophages and gamma delta T cells in the ZOL drug induced osteonecrosis of jaws based on the IFN gamma involved osteoblast differentiation signaling pathway.
   Results: The number and apoptotic rate of CD11b+Gr1hi cells and gamma delta T cells in the ONJ group were significantly higher. The TNF alpha, IL 1 beta, IFN gamma, CCL3, CCL4, IL 12 and IL 13 levels were significantly higher in the ONJ group. The expression of CTSK and FGFR3 was lower in the ONJ group, but was higher in the NF kappa B and ERBB2IP group.
   Conclusion: The proliferation of macrophages and gamma delta T cells promote the inflammation in ZOL induced jaw necrosis.
   Methods: A total of 20 patients with osteonecrosis of the jaw from January 2016 to March 2018 were collected and assigned into the observation group, while 20 healthy subjects were assigned into the control group. Furthermore, 40 SD rats were selected and assigned into observation group, while 10 non treatment SD rats were selected and assigned as controls. The distribution and proportion of CD11b+Gr1hi cells and gamma delta T cells in the necrotic tissues of the jaw were analyzed. Then, the TNF alpha, IL 1 beta, IFN gamma, CCL3, CCL4, IL 12 and IL 13 levels were measured. Afterwards, the expression of CTSK, FGFR3, NF kappa B and ERBB2IP in the necrotic tissues of the jaw in the animal models were analyzed.

AB Increasing evidence suggests that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM MSCs) are recruited into the stroma of developing tumors where they contribute to progression by enhancing tumor growth and metastasis, or by inducing anticancer drug resistance. Prostate cancer cells secrete ligands of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and EGFR signaling could play an important role in the cross talk between mesenchymal stem cells and prostate cancer cells. In this study, we showed that treatment of human primary MSCs with conditioned medium (CM) derived from the bone metastatic PC3 carcinoma cells (PC3 CM) resulted in: a significant activation of EGFR; increased proliferation; increased osteoblastic but decreased adipocitic differentiation; inhibition of senescence induced by serum starvation; increased CCL5 secretion. These activities were significantly inhibited in the presence of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. PC3 CM directly inhibited osteoclastogenesis as well as the ability of osteoblasts to induce osteoclast differentiation. The increased MSCs migration by PC3 CM and PC3 cells was partially mediated by CCL5. MSC CM increased the formation of colonies by PC3 cells and inhibited the anti proliferative activity of Docetaxel. Activation of EGFR expressed on MSCs by PC3 CM enhanced their capability to increase PC3 cells proliferation and to inhibit Docetaxel activity. These findings, by showing that the tumor promoting interactions between PC3 cells and MSCs are mediated, at least in part, by EGFR, suggest a novel application of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of prostate cancer.

AB Smart biomaterials play a key role when aiming at successful tissue repair by means of regenerative medicine approaches, and are expected to contain chemical as well as mechanical cues that will guide the regenerative process. Recent advances in the understanding of stem cell biology and mechanosensing have shed new light onto the importance of the local microenvironment in determining cell fate. Herein we report the biological properties of a bioactive, biodegradable calcium phosphate glass/polylactic acid composite biomaterial that promotes bone marrow derived endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) mobilisation, differentiation and angiogenesis through the creation of a controlled bone healing like microenvironment. The angiogenic response is triggered by biochemical and mechanical cues provided by the composite, which activate two synergistic cell signalling pathways: a biochemical one mediated by the calcium sensing receptor and a mechanosensitive one regulated by non muscle myosin II contraction. Together, these signals promote a synergistic response by activating EPCs mediated VEGF and VEGFR 2 synthesis, which in turn promote progenitor cell homing, differentiation and tubulogenesis. These findings highlight the importance of controlling microenvironmental cues for stem/progenitor cell tissue engineering and offer exciting new therapeutical opportunities for biomaterialbased vascularisation approaches and clinical applications.

AB The present study aimed to investigate the effects of strontium ranelate (SR), an anti osteoporotic drug, on osteolysis in an experimental mouse model of aseptic loosening. A total of 45 female C57BL/6J mice each received implantation of one titanium alloy pin into the tibia, followed by intraarticular injection of titanium particles. One week following surgery, mice were randomly divided into three groups: Control group (no additional treatment), SR625 group (treated with SR at a dose of 625 mg/kg/day), and SR1800 group (treated with SR at a dose of 1,800 mg/kg/day). SR was administered via oral gavage once every day for 12 weeks. Micro computed tomography scanning and hematoxylin/eosin staining were used to assess osteolysis around the prosthesis. Immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis were used to measure the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). Compared with the control, the SR625 and SR1800 groups exhibited a significantly increased pulling force of the titanium alloy pin. Bone volume and the bone surface/volume ratio in the periprosthetic tissue were significantly increased in the SR treated groups. Significant differences were observed between the SR1800 group and control group with respect to trabecular thickness and trabecular number. Mechanistically, SR downregulated the expression of RANKL and upregulated the expression of OPG in the periprosthetic tissue. In addition, SR was observed to inhibit wear particle associated osteolysis in a dose dependent manner. In conclusion, the present data illustrated that SR inhibited titanium particle induced osteolysis in vivo.

AB Objective: This study was carried out in order to evaluate the effect of 18 month treatment with PTH (1 34) or PTH (1 84) on serum sclerostin levels in humans. Subjects and methods: We investigated 10 women with severe osteoporosis, previously treated with alendronate and 20 untreated osteoporotic women. Subjects with severe osteoporosis were randomly divided into 2 groups of 5 patients each; the first group was treated with 20 mu g of PTH (1 34) and the second one with 100 mu g of PTH (1 84) according to an open label design. Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline and at 2, 4, and 24 h after hormone administration. The same protocol was followed at month 1, 6, 12, 18. Serum sclerostin levels were measured at each time point by a sandwich type enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Basal serum sclerostin levels were not significantly different between patients previously treated with alendronate and those never treated. No significant acute change of serum sclerostin levels was observed after PTH administration. Fitting a mixed effect regression model, we found a significant time effect (p=0.0012) using the sclerostin level as the response variable and the month of drug administration as a single covariate. Treatment with both PTH molecules induced a monthly mean reduction of sclerostin levels of 0.1956 pmol/l. Conclusions: Our results indicate that long term therapy with PTH (1 34) or PTH (1 84) in women with osteoporosis previously treated with alendronate is associated with a reduction in circulating sclerostin levels. This is a putative mechanism through which PTH performs its anabolic action. (J. Endocrinol. Invest. 35: 866 868, 2012) (c) 2012, Editrice Kurtis

TI The role of IL 1B in breast cancer bone metastasis
SO JOURNAL OF BONE ONCOLOGY

DT Article
DE Breast cancer; Bone metastasis; Interleukin 1B
ID ADJUVANT DENOSUMAB; CELLS; MULTICENTER
AB Interleukin 1B (IL 1B) is a potent pro inflammatory cytokine that plays multiple, pivotal roles, in the complex interplay between breast cancer cells and the bone microenvironment. IL 1B is involved in the growth of the primary tumours, regulation of inflammation within the tumour microenvironment, promotion of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration and invasion. Moreover, when breast cancer cells arrive in the bone microenvironment there is an upregulation of IL 1B which promotes the creation of a conducive niche for metastatic breast cancer cells as well as stimulating initiation of the vicious cycle of bone metastasis. Pre clinical studies have demonstrated that inhibition of IL 1 signalling reduces bone metastasis from oestrogen receptor positive/triple negative breast cancers in various mouse models. However, effects on primary tumours and soft tissue metastasis remain controversial with some studies showing increased tumour growth in these sites, whilst others show no effects. Notably, combining anti IL 1 therapy with standard of care treatments, such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy, has been demonstrated to reduce the growth of primary tumours, bone metastasis, as well as metastatic outgrowth in other organs. This review focuses on the mechanisms by which IL  1B promotes breast cancer bone metastasis.

AB Pamidronate, alendronate, APHBP and neridronate are a group of drugs, known as second generation bisphosphonates (2G BPs), commonly used in the treatment of bone resorption disorders, and recently their use has been related to some collateral side effects. The therapeutic activity of 2G BPs is related to the inhibition of the human Farnesyl Pyrophosphate Synthase (hFPPS). Available inhibitory activity values show that 2G BPs act time dependently, showing big differences in their initial inhibitory activities but similar final IC50 values. However, there is a lack of information explaining this similar final inhibitory potency. Although different residues have been identified in the stabilization of the R 2 side chain of 2G BPs into the active site, similar free binding energies were obtained that highlighted a similar stability of the ternary complexes, which in turns justified the similar IC50 values reported. Free binding energy calculations also demonstrated that the union of 2G BPs to the active site were 38 to 54 kcal mol( 1) energetically more favourable than the union of the natural substrate, which is the basis of the inhibition potency of the hFPPS activity.

AB Bone fractures are among the most common orthopaedic problems that affect individuals of all ages. Immediately after injury, activated macrophages dynamically contribute to and regulate an acute inflammatory response that involves other cells at the injury site, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). These macrophages and MSCs work in concert to modulate bone healing. In this study, we co cultured undifferentiated M0, pro inflammatory M1, and anti inflammatory M2 macrophages with primary murine MSCs in vitro to determine the cross talk between polarized macrophages and MSCs and their effects on osteogenesis. After 4 weeks of co culture, MSCs grown with macrophages, especially M1 macrophages, had enhanced bone mineralization compared to MSCs grown alone. The level of bone formation after 4 weeks of culture was closely associated with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) secretion early in osteogenesis. Treatment with celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase 2 (COX 2) selective inhibitor, significantly reduced bone mineralization in all co cultures but most dramatically in the M1 MSC co culture. We also found that the presence of macrophages reduced the secretion of osteoprotegerin (OPG), the decoy RANKL receptor, suggesting that macrophages may indirectly modulate osteoclast activity in addition to enhancing bone formation. Taken together, these findings suggest that an initial pro inflammatory phase modulated by M1 macrophages promotes osteogenesis in MSCs via the COX 2 PGE2 pathway. Understanding the complex interactions between macrophages and MSCs provide opportunities to optimize bone healing and other regenerative processes via modulation of the inflammatory response. This study provides one possible biological mechanism for the adverse effects of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs on fracture healing and bone regeneration.

AB Salmon calcitonin (sCT) is a polypeptide drug, possessing the ability to inhibit osteoclast mediated bone resorption. Just like other bioactive macromolecules, sCT is generally administered to the patients by either injection for poor compliance or through nasal spray for low bioavailability, which limits its use as therapeutic drugs. In the present study, to overcome the limitations of the conventional routes, two new dissolving microneedle arrays (DMNAs) based on transdermal sCT delivery systems were developed, namely sCT DMNA 1 (sCT/Dex/K90E) and sCT DMNA 2 (sCT/Dex Tre/K90E) with the same dimension, meeting the requirements of suitable mechanical properties. An accurate and reliable method was established to determine the needle drug loading proportion in sCT DMNAs. The stability study exhibited that the addition of trehalose could improve the stability of sCT in DMNA under high temperature and humidity. Further, in vivo pharmacodynamic study revealed that DMNA patch could significantly enhanced relative bioavailability to approximately 70%, and the addition of trehalose was found to be beneficial for sCT transdermal delivery. Therefore, sCT DMNA is expected to replace traditional dosage form, providing a secure, efficient, and low pain therapeutic strategy for bone disorders.

AB Nucleic acid aptamers hold promise as therapeutic tools for specific, tailored inhibition of protein targets with several advantages when compared to small molecules or antibodies. Nuclear WW domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligase 1 (WWP1) ubiquitin ligase poly ubiquitinates Runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), a key transcription factor associated with osteoblast differentiation. Since WWP1 and an adapter known as Schnurri 3 are negative regulators of osteoblast function, the disruption of this complex has the potential to increase bone deposition for osteoporosis therapy. Here, we develop new DNA aptamers that bind and inhibit WWP1 then investigate efficacy in an osteoblastic cell culture. DNA aptamers were selected against three different truncations of the HECT domain of WWP1. Aptamers which bind specifically to a C lobe HECT domain truncation were observed to enrich during the selection procedure. One particular DNA aptamer termed C3A was further evaluated for its ability to bind WWP1 and inhibit its ubiquitination activity. C3A showed a low !AM binding affinity to WWP1 and was observed to be a non competitive inhibitor of WWP1 HECT ubiquitin ligase activity. When SaOS 2 osteoblastic cells were treated with C3A, partial localization to the nucleus was observed. The C3A aptamer was also demonstrated to specifically promote extracellular mineralization in cell culture experiments. The C3A aptamer has potential for further development as a novel osteoporosis therapeutic strategy. Our results demonstrate that aptamer mediated inhibition of protein ubiquitination can be a novel therapeutic strategy.

AB Osteoporosis and overweight/obesity constitute major worldwide public health burdens that are associated with aging. A high proportion of women develop osteoporosis and increased intraabdominal adiposity after menopause. which leads to bone fractures and metabolic disorders. There is no efficient treatment without major side effects for these 2 diseases. We previously showed that the administration of oxytocin (OT) normalizes ovariectomy induced osteopenia and bone marrow adiposity in mice. Ovariectomized mice, used as an animal model mimicking menopause, were treated with OT or vehicle. Trabecular bone parameters and fat mass were analyzed using microcomputed tomography. Herein, we show that this effect on trabecular bone parameters was mediated through the restoration of osteoblast/osteoclast cross talk via the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand /osteoprotegerin axis. Moreover, the daily administration of OT normalized body weight and intraabdominal fat depots in ovariectomized mice. Intraabdominal fat mass is more sensitive to OT that sc fat depots, and this inhibitory effect is mediated through inhibition of adipocyte precursor's differentiation with a tendency to lower adipocyte size. OT treatment did not affect food intake, locomotors activity, or energy expenditure, but it did promote a shift in fuel utilization favoring lipid oxidation. In addition, the decrease in fat mass resulted from the inhibition of the adipose precursor's differentiation. Thus, OT constitutes an effective strategy for targeting osteopenia, overweight, and fat mass redistribution without any detrimental effects in a mouse model mimicking the menopause.

AB Corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, improved osteointegration, as well the prevention of inflammation and pain are the most desired characteristics of hip replacement implants. In this study we introduce a novel multi layered coating on AISI 316LVM stainless steel that shows promise with regard to all mentioned characteristics. The coating is prepared from alternating layers of the biocompatible polysaccharide chitosan and the non steroid anti inflammatory drug (NSAID), diclofenac. Electrochemical methods were employed to characterize the corrosion behavior of coated and uncoated samples in physiological solution. It is shown that these coatings improve corrosion resistance. It was also found that these coatings release the incorporated drug in controlled, multi mechanism manner. Adding additional layers on top of the as prepared samples, has potential for further tailoring of the release profile and increasing the drug dose. Biocompatibility was proven on human derived osteoblasts in several experiments. Only viable cells were found on the sample surface after incubation of the samples with the same cell line. This novel coating could prove important for prolongation of the application potential of steel based hip replacements, which are these days often replaced by more expensive ceramic or other metal alloys.

AB Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold great potential for tissue engineering and regeneration medicine. However, for clinical use, MSCs may be detrimental due to their uncertain fate during the transplantation. It is therefore highly desirable to develop biocompatible nanomaterials to integrate cell fate regulation with monitoring for MSC based therapy. Herein, we employ recently developed citric acid based carbon dots (CDs) and their derivatives (Et IPCA) for labeling and tracking of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs). We further investigate their biocompatibility and effects on the osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs. These highly fluorescent probes provide labeling of rBMSCs by internalization without affecting cell viability or inducing apoptosis when the concentration is lower than 50 mu g mL( 1). Importantly, the presence of the CDs and Et IPCA facilitates high efficiency osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs by promoting osteogenic transcription and enhancing matrix mineralization. Compared to Et IPCA, CDs considerably provide long term tracking and promote the differentiation of rBMSCs toward osteoblasts through the ROS mediated MAPK pathway. Taken together, our results consistently demonstrate that carbon dots are capable of both tracking and enhancing the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. This study sheds new light on the potential of carbon dots as a bifunctional tool in the thriving field of MSC based therapy.

AB Bone is the main store of calcium and progenitor cells in the body. During the resorption process, the local calcium concentration reaches 8 40 mM, and the surrounding cells are exposed to these fluctuations in calcium. This stimulus is a signal that is detected through the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR), which modulates chemotactic and proliferative G protein dependent signaling pathways. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the roles of extracellular calcium ([Ca2+](o)) and the CaSR in osteoinduction. Rat bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (rBMSCs) were stimulated with 10 mM of Ca2+. Several experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effect of [Ca2+](o) on chemotaxis, proliferation and differentiation on the osteoblastic lineage. It was found that [Ca2+](o) induces rBMSCs to migrate and proliferate in a concentration dependent manner. Real time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence also revealed that 10 mM Ca2+ stimulates overexpression of osteogenic markers in rBMSCs, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone sialoprotein, collagen Ia1 and osteocalcin. Functional assays determining ALP activity and mineralization tests both corroborate the increased expression of these markers in rBMSCs stimulated with Ca2+. Moreover, CaSR blockage inhibited the cellular response to stimulation with high concentrations of [Ca2+](o), revealing that the CaSR is a key modulator of these cellular responses.

AB Background: Zoledronic acid (Zol) is a potent inhibitor of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase with broad clinical use in the treatment of osteoporosis, and bone metastases. We have previously shown that encapsulation of Zol in liposomes targeted to the folate receptor (FR) greatly enhances its in vitro cytotoxicity. To examine whether targeted liposomal delivery of Zol could be a useful therapeutic approach, we investigated here the in vivo pharmacology of i.v. administered liposomal Zol (L Zol) in murine models.
   Methods: Zol was passively entrapped in the water phase of liposomes containing a small fraction of either dipalmitoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) or a polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated phospholipid with or without insertion of a folate lipophilic conjugate. Radiolabeled formulations were used for pharmacokinetic (PK) and biodistribution studies. Toxicity was evaluated by clinical, hematological, biochemical, and histopathological parameters. Therapeutic studies comparing free Zol, nontargeted and folate targeted L Zol were performed in FR expressing human tumor models.
   Results: Encapsulation of Zol in liposomes resulted in major PK changes including sustained high plasma levels and very slow clearance. DPPG L Zol was cleared faster than PEG L Zol. Grafting of folate lipophilic conjugates on liposomes further accelerated the clearance of Zol. L Zol caused a major shift in drug tissue distribution when compared to free Zol, with a major increase (20 to 100 fold) in liver and spleen, a substantial increase (7 to 10 fold) in tumor, and a modest increase (2 fold) in bone. Liposomal formulations proved to be highly toxic, up to 50 fold more than free Zol. PEG L Zol was more toxic than DPPG L Zol. Toxicity was non cumulative and appears to involve macrophage/monocyte activation and release of cytokines. Co injection of L Zol with a large dose of blank liposomes, or injection of a very low Zol to phospholipid ratio liposome formulation reduced toxicity by 2 4 fold suggesting that diluting macrophage exposure below a threshold Zol concentration is important to overcome toxicity. L Zol failed to significantly enhance the therapeutic activity of Zol vis a vis free ZOL and doxorubicin. Folate targeted L Zol was marginally better than other treatment modalities in the KB tumor model but toxic deaths greatly affected the outcome.
   Conclusions: Liposome delivery of Zol causes a major change in tissue drug distribution and an increase in tumor Zol levels. However, the severe in vivo toxicity of L Zol seriously limits its dose and its utility for in vivo tumor cell targeting. This strategy is under evaluation using liposomes carrying less toxic bisphosphonates. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. To investigate how miR 302b affect the calcium phosphorus metabolism and vascular calcification (VC) of rats with chronic renal failure (CRF) via the regulation of bone morphogentic proteins 2/Runt related transcription factor 3/Osterix (BMP 2/Runx2/Osterix) signaling pathway.
   Methods. SD rats were selected to establish CRF rat models and assigned into Sham, CRF, CRF miR 302b, and CRF + miR NC groups. The biochemical indexes of rats were detected at 8th and 12th week. Besides, HE staining and Von Kossa staining were performed to monitor renal structural changes and VC respectively; and quantitative real time PCR (qRT PCR) and Western blotting to evaluate the expressions of miR 302b and BMP 2/Runx2/Osterix signaling pathway separately.
   Results. HE and Von Kossa staining showed evident vascular calcification in rats from CRF and CRF + miR NC groups with a large number of black granules deposited in renal artery compared with Sham group, but was improved in rats in the CRF miR 302b group compared to those in the CRF group. Besides, rats in the CRF group had elevated levels of Scr, BUN, P, Cys C, and PTH, as well as the mRNA and protein expression of BMP 2, Runx2, and Osterix, and reduced serum Ca and miR 302b levels in a time dependent manner (all p < 0.05), which was in a completely opposite tendency in the CRF + miR 302b group (all p < 0.05).
   Conclusion. miR 302b may improve calcium phosphorus metabolism, and inhibit VC to alleviate the condition of CRF rats possibly associated with the BMP 2/Runx2/Osterix pathway, opening a new idea for CRF therapy. (C) 2018 IMSS. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI CTLA4 Ig Directly Inhibits Osteoclastogenesis by Interfering With

AB CTLA4 Ig (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 immunoglobulin; Abatacept) is a biologic drug for rheumatoid arthritis. CTLA4 binds to the CD80/86 complex of antigen presenting cells and blocks the activation of T cells. Although previous reports showed that CTLA4 Ig directly inhibited osteoclast differentiation, the whole inhibitory mechanism of CTLA4 Ig for osteoclast differentiation is unclear. Bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) from WT mice were cultured with M CSF and RANKL with or without the recombinant mouse chimera CTLA4 Ig. Intracellular calcium oscillations of BMMs with RANKL were detected by staining with calcium indicator fura 2 immediately after administration of CTLA4 Ig or after one day of treatment. Calcium oscillations were analyzed using Fc receptor gamma  (FcR gamma ) deficient BMMs. CTLA4 Ig inhibited osteoclast differentiation and reduced the expression of the nuclear factor of activated T cells NFATc1 in BMMs in vitro. Calcium oscillations in BMMs were suppressed by CTLA4 Ig both immediately after administration and after one day of treatment. CTLA4 Ig did not affect osteoclastogenesis and did not cause remarkable changes in calcium oscillations in FcR gamma deficient BMMs. Finally, to analyze the effect of CTLA4 Ig in vivo, we used an LPS induced osteolysis model. CTLA4 Ig suppressed LPS induced bone resorption in WT mice, not in FcR gamma deficient mice. In conclusion, CTLA4 Ig inhibits intracellular calcium oscillations depending on FcR gamma and downregulates NFATc1 expression in BMMs. (c) 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB Successful use of stem cell based therapeutic products is conditioned by transplantation of optimized cells in permissive microenvironment. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) fates are tightly regulated by humoral factors, cellular interactions and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAG), which are complex polysaccharides with structural heterogeneity. During osteogenesis, a temporally controlled expression of particular GAG species is required to interact with specific growth promoting and differentiating factors to regulate their biological activities. As a comparative tool to study natural GAG, we used structurally and functionally related synthetic GAG mimetics. One of these compounds [OTR4120] was previously shown to stimulate bone repair in rat models. Here, we demonstrate that structurally distinct GAG mimetics stimulate differentially clonogenicity, proliferation, migration and osteogenic phenotype of MSC in vitro, according to their specific chemical signature, underlying the role of sulfate and acetyl groups in specific interactions with heparin binding factors (HBF). These effects are dependent on FGF 2 interactions since they are inhibited by a FGF receptor 1 signaling pathway blocker. These data suggest that the in vivo [OTR4120] bone regenerative effect could be due to its ability to induce MSC migration and osteogenic differentiation. To conclude, we provide evidences showing that GAG mimetics may have great interest for bone regeneration therapy and represent an alternative to exogenous growth factor treatments to optimize potential therapeutic properties of MSC.

AB Osteoporosis is a common bone disorder where the declined bone mass is far more than normal physiological status and usually associated with enhanced fracture risk, reduced bone strength and even deteriorated quality of life. Recent studies showed that statins could exert beneficial effects on bones via promoting osteoblastic activity mediated by increased expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 and also by suppressing osteoclast proliferation. In this study, we developed atorvastatinloaded tetracycline poly (ethylene glycol) poly(lactic co glycolic acid) (TC PEG PLGA/ATO) micelles for the targeted treatment of osteoporosis. The TC PEG PLGA was synthesized under the action of coupling reagents and then ATO was encapsulated through solvent diffusion method with encapsulation efficiency and drug loading of 89.32 +/  2.48% and 8.20 +/  0.53%, respectively. The release of ATO from micelles could be maintained for more than 48 h in pH 7.4 PBS. Pharmacokinetic results further demonstrated that TC PEG PLGA micelles could effectively shield ATO leakage from micelles and prolong their circulation time. Benefiting from TC specifically binding to hydroxyapatite (HAp), TC PEG PLGA/ATO micelles exerted good bone targeted ability, as demonstrated by in vitro HAp affinity assay and biodistribution. Pharmacodynamic studies showed that TC PEG PLGA/ATO micelles could effectively improve bone mineral density and bone mechanical strength in osteoporotic rats. These results suggest that TC PEG PLGA/ATO micelles hold significant promise for the targeted treatment of osteoporosis.

AB SARS CoV 2 propagation in the world has led to rapid growth and an acceleration in the discoveries and publications of various interests. The main focus of a consistent number of studies has been the role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in binding the virus and its role in expression of the inflammatory response after transmission. ACE2 is an enzyme involved in the renin angiotensin system (RAS), whose key role is to regulate and counter angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin 1 7 (Ang1 7), making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular diseases. The classical RAS axis, formed by ACE, angiotensin II (Ang II), and angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1), activates several cell functions and molecular signalling pathways related to tissue injury and inflammation. In contrast, the RAS axis composed of ACE2, Ang1 7, and Mas receptor (MasR) exerts the opposite effect concerning the inflammatory response and tissue fibrosis. Recent studies have shown the presence of the RAS system in periodontal sites where osteoblasts, fibroblasts, and osteoclasts are involved in bone remodelling, suggesting that the role of ACE2 might have a fundamental function in the under  or overexpression of cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL 6), interleukin 7 (IL 7), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin 2 (IL 2), interleukin 1 beta (IL 1 beta), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP 1), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta), associated with a periodontal disorder, mainly during coinfection with SARS CoV 2, where ACE2 is underexpressed and cannot form the ACE2 Ang1 7 MasR axis. This renders the patient unresponsive to an inflammatory process, facilitating periodontal loss.

AB In clinic, strontium ranelate (SrR) is a useful drug to treat osteoporosis by orally taken method, but some side effect appeared in recent years. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of SrR on cells by direct application, to study the possibility of local application of this drug. Qualitative ALP staining, quantitative ALP activity assay, alizarin red staining, realtime PCR and westernblot assay were used to evaluate the osteogenesis ability of SrR under normal or osteogenic induction environment of ovariectomy bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (OVX BMSCs). The angiogenesis ability of SrR was studied by immunofluorescence staining of CD31 and vWF of OVX BMSCs under angiogenesis induction environment, transwell, tubeformation and realtime PCR assay of HUVECs. Signaling pathway of PI3K/AKT/mTOR was also studied. The result demonstrated that SrR could enhance proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of OVX BMSCs. The osteogenesis effect of SrR has been proved by the better performed of ALP activity, alizarin red staining and the remarkable up regulation of ALP, Col I, Runx2, OCN, BMP 2, BSP, OPG of the OVX BMSCs, and reduction of RANKL. In addition, SrR promotes angiogenesis differentiation of both OVX BMSCs and HUVECs. Higher intensity of immunostaining of CD31 and vWF, better result of transwell and tubeformation assay could be observed in SrR treated group, and increasing mRNA levels of VEGF and Ang 1 in the OVX BMSCs, VEGF in HUVECs were learnt. Signaling pathway assay showed that PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was involved in this SrR triggered angiogenesis procedure. The thrombosis marker ET 1, PAI 1 and t PA were up regulated, but no significant differences for low concentration (<0.5mM). The concentration between 0.25 0.5mM may be more appropriate for local application, and locally application of SrR could be considered as a promising way for bone regeneration.

AB Objective: In this study, we aimed to explore the role of MicroRNA 26 in photobiomodulation (PBM)  and adipose derived stem cell (ADS) based healing of critical sized foot fractures in a rat model.Background: PBM and ADS treatments are relatively invasive methods for treating bone defects. Specific and oriented cellular and molecular functions can be induced by applying an appropriate type of PBM and ADS treatment.Methods: A critical size foot defect (CSFD) is induced in femoral bones of 24 rats. Then, a human demineralized bone matrix scaffold (hDBMS) was engrafted into all CSFDs. The rats were randomly allocated into four groups (n = 6): (1) control (hDBMS); (2) hDBMS+human ADSs (hADSs), hADSs engrafted into CSFDs; (3) hDBMS+PBM, CSFD exposed to PBM (810 nm wavelength, 1.2 J/cm2 energy density); and (4) hDBMS+(hADSs+PBM), hADSs implanted into the CSFD and then exposed to PBM. At 42 days after CSFD induction, the rats were killed, and the left CSFD was removed for mechanical compression tests and the right CSFD was removed for molecular and histological studies.Results: The results indicate that miRNA 26a, BMP, SMAD, RUNX, and OSTREX had higher expression in the treated groups than in the control group. Further, the biomechanical and histological properties of CSFDs in treated groups were improved compared with the control group. Correlation tests revealed a positive relationship between microRNA and improved biomechanical and cellular parameters of CSFDs in the rat model.Conclusions: We concluded that the MicroRNA 26 signaling pathway probably plays a significant role in the hADS , PBM , and hADS+PBM based healing of CSFDs in rats.

AB An increased resistance to surgical site infections has been associated with surgical meshes composed of naturally occurring materials, including poly 4 hydroxybutrate (4HB). 4HB is a naturally occurring short chain fatty acid that has been shown to promote endogenous expression of the Cramp gene coding for the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) cathelicidin LL 37 in murine bone marrow derived macrophages. The molecular pathways involved in the 4HB induced cathelicidin LL 37 expression have not yet been identified. The present study showed that transcriptional activation of the Cramp gene by 4HB is independent of inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, and that upregulation of Cramp is modulated by the G protein coupled receptor GPR109A. Furthermore, an intracellular signaling cascade that promotes the activation of the MAP kinases, p38 and JNK, and a subsequent NF kappa B phosphorylation downstream from p38 is essential for the AMP transcriptional response in 4HBstimulated macrophages. The findings provide a solid scientific basis and rationale for the decreased incidence of surgical site infections with the use of this type of surgical meshes. Further clinical significance is found in the fact that the 4HB activated molecular pathway includes common targets of frequently used nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other FDA approved drugs recognizing G protein coupled receptors.

AB It has been suggested that nitric oxide (NO) derived from inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) may act as a mediator of cytokine incluced effects on bone turn over. NO is also recognized as an important factor in bone remodeling, i.e., participating in osteoblast apoptosis in an arthritic joint. The components of Agastache rugosa are known to have many pharmacological activities. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Agastache rugosa leaf extract (ELAR) on NO production and the iNOS expression in ROS 17/2.8 cells activated by a mixture of inflammatory cytokines including TNF alpha and IL 1 beta. A preincubation with ELAR significantly and concentration dependently reduced the expression of iNOS protein in ROS 17/2.8 cells activated with the cytokine mixture. Consequently, the NO production was also significantly reduced by ELAR with an IC50 of 0.75 mg/mL. The inhibitory mechanism of iNOS induction by ELAR prevented the activation and translocation of NF kappa B (p65) to the nucleus from the cytosol fraction. Furthermore, ELAR concentration dependently reduced the cellular toxicity induced by sodium nitroprusside, an NO donor. These results suggest that ELAR may be beneficial in NO mediated inflammatory conditions such as osteoporosis.

TI Kaempferol as a flavonoid induces osteoblastic differentiation via
   estrogen receptor signaling
SO CHINESE MEDICINE

ID BONE; QUERCETIN; CELLS; HEART
AB Background: Flavonoids, a group of compounds mainly derived from vegetables and herbal medicines, chemically resemble estrogen and some have been used as estrogen substitutes. Kaempferol, a flavonol derived from the rhizome of Kaempferia galanga L., is a well known phytoestrogen possessing osteogenic effects that is also found in a large number of plant foods.
   The herb K. galanga is a popular traditional aromatic medicinal plant that is widely used as food spice and in medicinal industries. In the present study, both the estrogenic and osteogenic properties of kaempferol are evaluated.
   Methods: Kaempferol was first evaluated for its estrogenic properties, including its effects on estrogen receptors. The osteogenic properties of kaempferol were further determined its induction effects on specific osteogenic enzymes and genes as well as the mineralization process in cultured rat osteoblasts.
   Results: Kaempferol activated the transcriptional activity of pERE Luc (3.98 +/  0.31 folds at 50 mu M) and induced estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) phosphorylation in cultured rat osteoblasts, and this ER activation was correlated with induction and associated with osteoblast differentiation biomarkers, including alkaline phosphatase activity and transcription of osteoblastic genes, e.g., type I collagen, osteonectin, osteocalcin, Runx2 and osterix. Kaempferol also promoted the mineralization process of osteoblasts (4.02 +/  0.41 folds at 50 mu M). ER mediation of the kaempferol induced effects was confirmed by pretreatment of the osteoblasts with an ER antagonist, ICI 182,780, which fully blocked the induction effect.
   Conclusion: Our results showed that kaempferol stimulates osteogenic differentiation of cultured osteoblasts by acting through the estrogen receptor signaling.

AB Plasma calcium (Ca2+) is maintained by amending the release of parathyroid hormone and through direct effects of the Ca2+ sensing receptor (CaSR) in the renal tubule. Combined, these mechanisms alter intestinal Ca2+ absorption by modulating 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D 3 production, bone resorption, and renal Ca2+ excretion. The CaSR is a therapeutic target in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism and hypocalcemia, a common complication of calcimimetic therapy. The CaSR is also expressed in intestinal epithelium; however, a direct rote in regulating local intestinal Ca2+ absorption is unknown. Chronic CaSR activation decreased expression of genes involved in Ca2+ absorption. In Ussing chambers, increasing extracellular Ca2+ or basolateral application of the calcimimetic cinacalcet decreased net Ca2+ absorption across intestinal preparations acutely. Conversely, Ca2+ absorption increased with decreasing extracellular Ca(2+)( )concentration. These responses were absent in mice expressing a nonfunctional TRPV6, TRPV6(D541A). Cinacalcet also attenuated Ca2+ fluxes through TRPV6 in Xenopus oocytes when coexpressed with the CaSR. Moreover, the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 prevented cinacalcet mediated inhibition of Ca2+ flux. These results reveal a regulatory pathway whereby activation of the CaSR in the basolateral membrane of the intestine directly attenuates local Ca2+ absorption via TRPV6 to prevent hypercalcemia and help explain how calcimimetics induce hypocalcemia.

AB Heat treated polyacrylonitrile (HT PAN), also referred to as black orlon (BO), is a promising carbon based material used for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. To the best of our knowledge, no such complex bone morphology mimicking three dimensional (3D) BO structure has been reported to date. We report that BO can be easily made into 3D cryogel scaffolds with porous structures, using succinonitrile as a porogen. The cryogels possess a porous morphology, similar to bone tissue. The prepared scaffolds showed strong osteoconductive activity, providing excellent support for the adhesion, proliferation, and mitochondrial activity of human bone derived cells. This effect was more apparent in scaffolds prepared from a matrix with a higher content of PAN (i.e., 10% rather than 5%). The scaffolds with 10% of PAN also showed enhanced mechanical properties, as revealed by higher compressive modulus and higher compressive strength. Therefore, these scaffolds have a robust potential for use in bone tissue engineering.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Guijiajiao (Colla Carapacis et Plastri, CCP), the glue of tortoise shell, on bone regeneration in zebrafish and male Wistar rats.
   METHODS: In this study, we applied in vitro and in vivo models, tissue section analysis, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction to assess the effects of CCP on bone repair. MG 63 cells were used in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization assays. Zebrafish and male Wistar rats were used to evaluate the effects of CCP on bone repair in vivo.
   RESULTS: A simple preparation of CCP promoted osteogenesis in vivo and in vitro, and promoted MG 63 cell proliferation as well as ALP activity and mineralization. In addition, CCP activated Akt and extracellular signaling regulated kinase pathways and significantly increased the expression of ossification related genes and proteins such as runt related transcription factor 2, osteocalcin, and osteopontin. The in vivo results revealed promotion of osteogenesis by immersing zebrafish in CCP for 72 h. An oral dose of 1.25 g/kg CCP significantly improved skull defects in rats, which was accompanied by an increase in serum ALP levels.
   CONCLUSION: One of the ingredients of Guilu Erx ianjiao (tortoise shell and deer horn formula) provides a practical alternative therapy for bone regeneration. (C) 2018 JTCM. All rights reserved.

TI Increased intracellular iron and mineralization of cultured hFOB 1.19
   cells following hepcidin activation through ferroportin 1
SO SAUDI MEDICAL JOURNAL

DT Article
ID BONE; DEFICIENCY; EXPRESSION
AB Objectives: To address whether hepcidin functions in bone metabolism.
   Methods: This study was carried out in the Laboratory of Radiation Medicine and Public Health of Soochow University, and the Laboratory of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China, from September 2009 to July 2010. The positive expression of ferroportin 1 (Fpn 1) was detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. After the treatment with distilled water (control group) and hepcidin (25noml/L, 50noml/L, 100noml/L), the fluorescence intensity related to intracellular iron concentration of a human fetal osteoblast cell line (hFOB 1.19) was measured by a confocal laser scanning microscope. A 3 (4,5  dimethylthiazol 2 y1)   2 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and Von Kossa staining was performed to evaluate cell proliferation and mineralization in cultured hFOB 1.19 cells.
   Results: This study revealed a high level expression of Fpn 1 in hFOB 1.19. On the basis of which, it was found that 25noml/L, 50noml/L, 100noml/L hepcidin could promote the fluorescence intensity related to intracellular iron concentration and mineralization in hFOB 1.19 in a dose dependent manner (p<0.05), but hepcidin had no effect on FOB 1.19 proliferation (p>0.05).
   Conclusion: The hepcidin ferroportin signal pathway may function in the osteoblast cell line of hFOB 1.19 cells. It is also suggested that cross talk between iron and calcium homeostasis may play a role in bone metabolism in responding to hepcidin activation.

AB Background Resistance to chemotherapy is one of the major hurdles in current cancer therapy. With the increasing occurrence of drug resistance, a paradigm shift in treatment strategy is required. Recently "medication vacation" has emerged as a unique, yet uncomplicated strategy in which withdrawal of drug pressure for certain duration allowed tumor cells to regain sensitivity to the drug. However, little is known about the molecular alterations associated with such an outcome. Methods In this study, human osteosarcoma (OS) cells resistant to the extensively used drug cisplatin, were withdrawn from drug pressure, and thereafter cytotoxic response of the cells to the drug was evaluated. We further performed next generation RNA sequencing and compared transcriptome between parental (OS), resistant (OS R) and the drug withdrawn (OS DW) cells. Differentially expressed transcripts were identified, and biological association network (BAN), gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of the differentially regulated transcripts were performed to identify key events associated with withdrawal of drug pressure. Results Following drug withdrawal, the sensitivity of the cells to the drug was found to be regained. Analysis of the expression profile showed that key genes like, IRAK3, IL6ST, RELA, AKT1, FKBP1A and ADIPOQ went significantly down in OS DW cells when compared to OS R. Also, genes involved in Wnt signaling, PI3K Akt, Notch signaling, and ABC transporters were drastically down regulated in OS DW cells compared to OS R. Although, a very small subset of genes maintained similar expression pattern between OS, OS R and OS DW, nonetheless majority of the transcriptomic pattern of OS DW was distinctively different and unique in comparison to either the drug sensitive OS or drug resistant OS R cells. Conclusion Our data suggests that though drug withdrawal causes reversal of sensitivity, the transcriptomic pattern does not necessarily show significant match with resistant or parental control cells. We strongly believe that exploration of the molecular basis of drug holiday might facilitate additional potential alternative treatment options for aggressive and resistant cancers.

AB Compromised bone strength in osteoporosis predisposes patients to an increased fracture risk. The management of these fractures is complicated due to the poor bone quality, which may lead to inadequate fixation strength and stability. While a number of studies using osteoporotic animal models have shown a detrimental impact on fracture healing, clinical evidence regarding whether fracture healing is impaired in the presence of osteoporosis is complicated by numerous associated conditions including advancing age.
   The mechanism of some anti osteoporotic medications creates concern about a potential detrimental impact on fracture healing, while others appear to enhance fracture healing. The current evidence indicates that the beneficial effects of anti osteoporosis treatment exceeds any concerns about possible adverse consequences on fracture healing in most circumstances.

AB BackgroundOsteoporosis (OP) is a systemic skeletal disorder with increased bone fragility. Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) have multi lineage differentiation ability, which may play important roles in osteoporosis. In this study, we aim to investigate the role of hBMSC derived miR 382 in osteogenic differentiation.MethodsThe miRNA and mRNA expressions in peripheral blood monocytes between persons with high or low bone mineral density (BMD) were compared. Then we collected the hBMSC secreted sEV and examined the dominant components. The over expression of the miR 382 in MG63 cell and its progression of osteogenic differentiation were investigated by qRT PCR, western blot and alizarin red staining. The interaction between miR 382 and SLIT2 was confirmed by dual luciferase assay. The role of SLIT2 was also confirmed through up regulation in MG63 cell, and the osteogenic differentiation associated gene and protein were tested.ResultsAccording to bioinformatic analysis, a series of differential expressed genes between persons with high or low BMD were compared. After internalization of hBMSC sEV in MG63 cells, we observed that the ability of osteogenic differentiation was significantly enhanced. Similarly, after up regulation of miR 382 in MG63 cells, osteogenic differentiation was also promoted. According to the dual luciferase assay, the targeting function of miR 382 in SLIT2 was demonstrated. Moreover, the benefits of hBMSC sEV in osteogenesis were abrogated through up regulation of SLIT2.ConclusionOur study provided evidence that miR 382 contained hBMSC sEV held great promise in osteogenic differentiation in MG63 cells after internalization by targeting SLIT2, which can be served as molecular targets to develop effective therapy.

AB International guidelines recommend adjuvant bisphosphonates (BPs) for post menopausal women with early breast cancer to reduce recurrence and mortality. However, globally, wide variation exists in their adoption. In the UK, adjuvant BPs were a recommendation in the breast cancer Clinical Reference Group service specification and were included as a priority for implementation by the national oncologists group UK Breast Cancer Group in November 2015, promoting national uptake, guidance and funding arrangements. In 2018, adjuvant BPs were recommended by the UKs National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. In Australia, adjuvant BPs are still 'off label' and do not receive national reimbursement or endorsement. To date there has been no research into the prescribing habits of these agents in Australia. With the aim to gather data on adjuvant BPs prescribing practices, online surveys were devel oped and disseminated to breast oncologists in both countries between December 2018 and June 2019. Almost all of the UK oncologists prescribed adjuvant BPs, demonstrating that education, endorsement from professional bodies, presence of national guidelines and funding decisions have been critical to implementation. In contrast, only 48% of the Australian responders prescribed adjuvant BPs, while 83% reported that they would prescribe them if funding was available. Lack of local protocol guidance was also seen as a major barrier. This study was intended to assess the pathway taken for adjuvant BP imple mentation in the UK and how it might inform changes in Australian practice and also guide other coun tries with similar issues with the ultimate aim of improving the care of women with early breast cancer globally.

AB Previous studies suggest switching from pamidronate to a more potent bone targeted agent is associated with biomarker and palliative response in breast cancer patients with bone metastases. Until now, this has not been addressed in a double blind, randomized trial. Breast cancer patients with high risk bone metastases, despite >3 months of pamidronate, were randomized to either continue pamidronate or switch to zoledronic acid every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving a fall in serum C telopeptide (sCTx) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included difference in mean sCTx, pain scores, quality of life, toxicity, and skeletal related events (SREs). Seventy three patients entered the study; median age 61 years (range 37 87). Proportion of patients achieving a fall in sCTx over the 12 week evaluation period was 26/32 (81 %) with zoledronic acid and 18/29 (62 %) with pamidronate (p = 0.095). Mean decrease in sCTx (mean difference between groups = 50 ng/L, 95 % CI 18 84; p = 0.003) was significantly greater in patients who received zoledronic acid. Quality of life, pain scores, toxicity, and frequency of new SREs were comparable between the two arms. While a switch from pamidronate to zoledronic acid resulted in reduction in mean sCTx, there were no significant differences between the arms for proportion of patients achieving a reduction in sCTx, quality of life, pain scores, toxicity or SREs. Given the lack of palliative improvement, the current data do not support a switching strategy.

AB Osteoporosis is a common disease in elderly individuals, and osteoporosis can easily lead to bone and hip fractures that seriously endanger the health of elderly individuals. At present, the treatment of osteoporosis is mainly anti osteoporosis drugs, but there are side effects associated with anti osteoporosis drugs. Therefore, it is very important to develop early diagnostic indicators and new therapeutic drugs for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), noncoding RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides, can be used as diagnostic markers for osteoporosis, and lncRNAs play an important role in the progression of osteoporosis. Many studies have shown that lncRNAs can be the target of osteoporosis. Therefore, herein, the role of lncRNAs in osteoporosis is summarized, aiming to provide some information for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.

AB The aim of this study is to evaluate the alendronate and raloxifene influence in the alveolar healing process of osteoporotic rats.
   Sixty four female rats were divided in four groups: sham rats (SHAM), ovariectomized rats and no medical treatment (OVX NT), ovariectomized rats and submitted to alendronate treatment (OVX ALE), and ovariectomized and submitted to raloxifene treatment (OVX RAL). The histomorphometrical and immunohistochemical analysis was performed. The quantitative data were analyzed through Kruskal Wallis and Dunn tests (alpha = 0.05).
   In the longest period, SHAM and OVX RAL groups showed the better bone formation responses (P < 0.05). The worst bone formation response was observed in the group OVX NT. OVX RAL group showed the better response at 42 days. OVX ALE group showed a favorable response at 14 days, in comparison with OVX RAL group, but a reduced response at 42 days. It was possible to observe a mature bone in SHAM group at 14 days and an immature bone in the OVX NT group. An intermediate quality bone was observed in the groups OVX ALE and OVX RAL.
   Alendronate and raloxifene treatment improved the alveolar healing process in osteoporotic rats, but not enough to achieve the histometrical and protein expression values that were observed in the SHAM group.
   Alendronate is largely used as a potent antiresorptive agent. Otherwise, considering the undesirable effects in relation to the alveolar healing, other antiosteoporosis medications should be studied. Raloxifene seems to be a good candidate once its action mechanism involves the activation of osteoblasts.

AB Bone formation or regeneration requires the recruitment, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of stem/stromal progenitor cells. A potent stimulus driving this process is mechanical loading. Osteocytes are mechanosensitive cells which play fundamental roles in coordinating loading induced bone formation via the secretion of paracrine factors. However, the exact mechanisms by which osteocytes relay mechanical signals to these progenitor cells are poorly understood. Therefore, this study aimed to demonstrate the potency of the mechanically stimulated osteocyte secretome in driving human bone marrow stem/stromal cell (hMSC) recruitment and differentiation, and characterize the secretome to identify potential factors regulating stem cell behavior and bone mechanobiology. We demonstrate that osteocytes subjected to fluid shear secrete a distinct collection of factors that significantly enhance hMSC recruitment and osteogenesis and demonstrate the key role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in driving these effects. This demonstrates the pro osteogenic potential of osteocyte derived mechanically activated extracellular vesicles, which have great potential as a cell free therapy to enhance bone regeneration and repair in diseases such as osteoporosis.

AB Ample evidence supports that prostate tumor metastasis originates from a rare population of cancer cells, known as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Unfortunately, little is known about the identity of these cells, making it difficult to target the metastatic prostate tumor. Here, for the first time, we report the identification of a rare population of prostate cancer cells that express the Tie 2 protein. We found that this Tie 2(High) population exists mainly in prostate cancer cell lines that are capable of metastasizing to the bone. These cells not only express a higher level of CSC markers but also demonstrate enhanced resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug Cabazitaxel. In addition, knockdown of the expression of the Tie 2 ligand angiopoietin (Ang 1) led to suppression of CSC markers, suggesting that the Ang 1/Tie 2 signaling pathway functions as an autocrine loop for the maintenance of prostate CSCs. More importantly, we found that Tie 2(High) prostate cancer cells are more adhesive than the Tie 2(Low) population to both osteoblasts and endothelial cells. Moreover, only the Tie 2(High), but not the Tie 2(Low) cells developed tumor metastasis in vivo when injected at a low number. Taken together, our data suggest that Tie 2 may play an important role during the development of prostate tumor metastasis.

AB Gram negative, anaerobic bacterias are predominate in periapical infections. The bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) initiates the process of inflammation and periapical bone resorption. Usage of various medicaments retards or inactivates the bacterial endotoxin (LPS). However, the results are not highly effective. In recent years, owing to antimicrobial resistance, the shift from conventional agents to herbal agents has been increased tremendously in research. Keeping this in mind, the present study was formulated to evaluate the efficacy of oregano essential oil in inhibiting bacterial LPS  induced osteoclastogenesis. Four different concentrations (0 ng/mL, 25 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, and 100 ng/mL) of oregano essential oil extract were added into 96 well culture plate. Under light microscope, quantification of osteoclast cells was performed. One way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey test was carried out on SPSS v21. A significant reduction (p < 0.001) in the osteoclast was observed in the experimental groups compared to no oregano essential oil extract (control). A dose dependent significant reduction (p < 0.001) in osteoclast formation was observed among the experimental groups, with lesser osteoclast seen in group IV with 100 ng/mL of oregano essential oil extract. Thus, it can be concluded that oregano essential oil extract can be utilized as a therapeutic agent that can target bacterial LPS induced osteoclastogenesis. However, randomized controlled studies should be conducted to assess the potential use of this extract in the periapical bone resorption of endodontic origin.

AB Objective. Although the osteoprotegerin (OPG)/RANK/RANKL system is the main modulator of bone remodeling, it remains unclear whether it is regulated in cartilage during osteoarthritis (OA). The aim of this study was to examine whether nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment modulates the synthesis of OPG and RANKL in the cartilage of patients with OA, and to investigate whether prostaglandin E 2 (PGE(2)) modifies this system in human OA chondrocytes in culture.
   Methods. A 3 month clinical trial was carried out in 20 patients with severe knee OA, all of whom were scheduled to undergo knee replacement surgery. Ten of these patients were treated with celecoxib, and the other 10 patients, who did not want to be treated, served as the control group. After surgery, cartilage was processed for molecular biology studies. We also used human OA chondrocytes to examine the effects of PGE(2) on OPG/RANKL synthesis, examining which surface receptors were affected by PGE(2).
   Results. In patients with OA, celecoxib decreased RANKL synthesis in the cartilage, thereby increasing the OPG: RANKL ratio. In human OA chondrocytes in culture, PGE(2) elicited a dose  and time dependent increase in the synthesis of RANKL, the extent of which was greater than that of OPG. Confocal microscopy revealed that PGE(2) induced RANKL transport to the cell membrane. Only EP2/EP4 agonists reproduced the effects of PGE(2) on OPG and RANKL induction.
   Conclusion. Long term NSAID treatment inhibited the resorptive signal synthesized by chondrocytes. In vitro, PGE(2) regulated the expression and release of these key mediators of bone metabolism by articular chondrocytes. The role of OPG/RANK/RANKL in OA cartilage metabolism is still unknown, although the synthesis of these proteins would enable the cartilage to control the activity of subchondral bone cells.

AB The aim of this study was to quantify and provide evidence as to how addition of tricalcium phosphate (beta TCP) and the Hedgehog agonist purmorphamine to a degradable bone adhesive affects cell attachment/proliferation and Hedgehog pathway activation. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated that high levels (75 wt.%) of beta TCP addition reduced the photocure rate of the chosen poly(propylene glycol co lactide) dimethacrylate (PPLM) bone adhesive, but this problem was overcome by increased light exposure. In phosphate buffered saline the total surface mass loss of set 15 mm diameter PPLM films was similar to 3.2 mg in 12 weeks, irrespective of thickness (200 or 400 mu m) or beta TCP level (50 or 75 wt.%). With 400 mu m samples there was additional bulk material loss. Proliferation of pre osteoblast cells (MC3T3 E1) on the set adhesive surfaces was enhanced by decreased sample thickness or filler content increase. Degradation evidence suggested that both effects were due to reduced acidic polymeric degradation products. Activation of the Hedgehog pathway was quantified by measuring Gli expression in Light II reporter cells. The 0.01 and 0.1 wt.% purmorphamine in composite discs (400 mu m, 75 wt.% beta TCP) enhanced Gli expression of attached cells 2  and 5 fold, respectively, without influencing their number. Pre storage of the composite samples in culture medium had no detrimental effect on this response. Furthermore, sample storage medium gave no enhanced Gli expression in cells on tissue culture plastic. This suggests drug release levels were very low. Purmorphamine and beta TCP incorporation in PPLM adhesives might, therefore, provide prolonged enhancement of in vivo bone repair without systemic drug side effects. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB Background: One endpoint of periodontal therapy is to regenerate the structure lost due to periodontal disease. In the periodontium, gingival epithelium is regenerated by oral epithelium. Underlying connective tissue, periodontal ligament, bone, and cementum are derived from connective tissue. Primitive connective tissue cells may develop into osteoblasts and cementoblasts, which form bone and cementum. Several procedural advances may support these regenerations; however, the regeneration of alveolar bone does not always occur. Therefore, bone stimulating factors are a main topic for periodontal reconstructive research. The present study was designed to examine histopathologically whether the application of an electrical field could demonstrate enhanced alveolar and cementum regeneration and modify tissue factors.
   Methods: Seven beagle dogs were used for this experiment. Mandibular left and right sides served as control and experimental sides, respectively, and 4 walled intrabony defects were created bilaterally between the third and fourth premolars. The experimental side was treated with a capacitively coupled electrical field (CCEF) (sinusoidal wave, 60 kHz, and 5 V peak to peak), applied for 14 hours per day. The following measurements were performed on the microphotographs: 1) the distance from the cemento enamel junction to the apical notch (CEJ AN) and from the crest of newly formed bone (alveolar ridge) to the apical notch (AR AN); 2) the thickness of new cementum in the apical notch region; and 3) the length of junctional epithelium. The following histopathologic parameters were assessed by a semiquantitative subjective method: 1) inflammatory cell infiltration (ICI); 2) cellular activity of the periodontal ligament; 3) number and morphology of osteoclasts; 4) resorption lacunae; and 5) osteoblastic activity.
   Results: The results showed that the quantity of new bone fill and the mean value of the thickness of the cementum were significantly higher for the experimental side (P < 0.01). The location of the base of the pocket was positioned more coronally with respect to the apical point of the coronal notch in the experimental side (statistically significant P < 0.01). The length of the junctional epithelium and the number of osteoclasts were higher in the stimulated side than the coronal side; these findings were also statistically significant (P < 0.01). The comparison of the electrically stimulated versus non stimulated mandibles with the semiquantitative subjective method demonstrated statistically significant differences in defined histopathologic parameters, except for osteoclast morphologies (P > 0.05).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the CCEF method has the potential to produce reconstructive effects and bone deposits. Further investigations with respect to the theoretical determination of local field parameters of the periodontal tissue complex, such as permittivity, conductivity, strength of the field electrical stimulation applied to the periodontal field current density, wavelength, and signal frequency appropriate for this field, should be undertaken. Using different electromotive forces alone or in combination with bone graft materials, guided tissue regeneration techniques, and dental implants may achieve a new dimension in periodontal therapy in the near future.

AB Objective: In this study, we aimed to explore the role of MicroRNA 26 in photobiomodulation (PBM)  and adipose derived stem cell (ADS) based healing of critical sized foot fractures in a rat model. Background: PBM and ADS treatments are relatively invasive methods for treating bone defects. Specific and oriented cellular and molecular functions can be induced by applying an appropriate type of PBM and ADS treatment. Methods: A critical size foot defect (CSFD) is induced in femoral bones of 24 rats. Then, a human demineralized bone matrix scaffold (hDBMS) was engrafted into all CSFDs. The rats were randomly allocated into four groups (n = 6): (1) control (hDBMS); (2) hDBMS+human ADSs (hADSs), hADSs engrafted into CSFDs; (3) hDBMS+PBM, CSFD exposed to PBM (810 nm wavelength, 1.2 J/cm2 energy density); and (4) hDBMS+(hADSs+PBM), hADSs implanted into the CSFD and then exposed to PBM. At 42 days after CSFD induction, the rats were killed, and the left CSFD was removed for mechanical compression tests and the right CSFD was removed for molecular and histological studies. Results: The results indicate that miRNA 26a, BMP, SMAD, RUNX, and OSTREX had higher expression in the treated groups than in the control group. Further, the biomechanical and histological properties of CSFDs in treated groups were improved compared with the control group. Correlation tests revealed a positive relationship between microRNA and improved biomechanical and cellular parameters of CSFDs in the rat model. Conclusions: We concluded that the MicroRNA 26 signaling pathway probably plays a significant role in thehADS , PBM , and hADS+PBM based healing of CSFDs in rats.

TI Anti malarial effect of a combination of risedronate and azithromycin

AB Combination therapy is used to retard the selection of malaria parasite strains resistant to individual components of a combination of drugs. This approach has proved to be a success in the combination of sulphadoxine and pyrimethamine, which targets two different steps in the folate pathway of malaria parasites. However, after the success of this therapeutic combination, the efficacy of other combinations of drugs that target different enzymes in a particular metabolic pathway has, apparently, not been reported. In the current study, the antimalarial effect of a combination of risedronate (RIS), which is known for its anti osteoporosis activity, and azithromycin (AZT) was investigated. Peter's suppression test was carried out on mice infected with 1 x 107 P. yoelii infected erythrocytes. Drug efficacy was analyzed by comparing the percent reduction in parasitaemia on day 4 postinfection. RIS was observed to be a blood schizonticidal agent against P. yoelii infection which showed ED50 7.0 (4.04 12.13) mg/kg/day x 4. Normalized isobologram showed additive action between RIS 1 mg/kg/day x 4 and AZT 10 mg/kg/day x 4, and antagonistic action for the rest of the combinations (RIS 1 + AZT 20, RIS 1 + AZT 40, RIS 5 + AZT 10, RIS 5 + AZT 20, RIS 5 + AZT 40, RIS 10 + AZT 10, RIS 10 + AZT 20 and RIS 10 + AZT 40 mg/kg/day x 4). Furthermore, a combination of RIS with AZT showed inferior efficacy as compared to AZT treatment alone. This antagonistic interaction may be due to the high accumulation of AZT in WBCs, which will reduce its serum bio availability, whereas RIS has anti parasitic activity by increasing WBCs.

AB Unaccustomed exercise leads to satellite cell proliferation and increased skeletal muscle protein turnover. Several growth factors and cytokines may be involved in the adaptive responses. Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) negatively affect muscle regeneration and adaptation in animal models, and inhibit the exercise induced satellite cell proliferation and protein synthesis in humans. However, the cellular mechanisms eliciting these responses remain unknown. Eight healthy male volunteers performed 200 maximal eccentric contractions with each leg. To block prostaglandin synthesis locally in the skeletal muscle, indomethacin (NSAID) was infused for 7.5 h via microdialysis catheters into m. vastus lateralis of one leg. Protein synthesis was determined by the incorporation of 1,2 C 13(2) leucine into muscle protein from 24 to 28 h post exercise. Furthermore, mRNA expression of selected genes was measured in muscle biopsies (5 h and 8 days post exercise) by real time reverse transcriptase PCR. Myofibrillar and collagen protein synthesis were unaffected by the local NSAID infusion. Five hours post exercise, the mRNA expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) was sixfold higher in the NSAID leg (P = 0.016) compared with the unblocked leg. The expression of growth factors and matrix related genes were unaffected by NSAID. Although NSAIDs inhibit the exercise induced satellite cell proliferation, we observed only limited effects on gene expression, and on post exercise protein synthesis.

AB Astragaloside (AS) has an anti osteoporotic effect, but its poor water solubility and low bioavailability limit its application. In this study, a novel nano carrier with bone targeting was prepared by modifying mPEG PLGA with alendronate (AL) before incorporation into astragaloside nano micelles (AS AL mPEG PLGA) to enhance the oral bioavailability, bone targeting and anti osteoporosis effect of AS. The release behavior of AS AL mPEG PLGA in vitro was investigated via dialysis. The pharmacokinetics of AS AL mPEG PLGA was studied in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. The cytotoxicity of AS AL mPEG PLGA in vitro (via MTT method), coupled with bone targeting ability in vitro and in vivo were evaluated. The therapeutic effects of free AS and AS AL mPEG PLGA (ELISA, micro CT, H&E staining) were compared in osteoporotic rats. AS AL mPEG PLGA with smaller particle size (45.3 +/  3.8 nm) and high absolute zeta potential ( 23.02 +/  0.51 mV) were successfully prepared, wherein it demonstrated higher entrapment efficiency (96.16 +/  0.18%), a significant sustained release effect for 96 h and acceptable safety within 10 200 mu g/mL. AS AL mPEG PLGA could enhance the hydroxyapatite affinity and bone tissue concentration of AS. The relative bioavailability of AS AL mPEG PLGA was 233.90% compared with free AS. In addition, the effect of AS in reducing serum levels of bone metabolism related indicators, restoring the bone microarchitecture and improving bone injury could be enhanced by AS AL mPEG PLGA. AS AL mPEG PLGA with small particle size, good stability, remarkable sustained release effect, safety and bone targeting was successfully constructed in this experiment to potentially improve the oral bioavailability and anti osteoporosis effect of AS. Thus, AS AL mPEG PLGA may be a promising strategy to prevent and treat osteoporosis.

AB Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) based therapy is a promising therapeutic strategy for several biomedical applications. Following the observation that endogenous and exogenous H2S plays a prominent role as a bone anabolic agent, we recently developed a silk fibroin (SF) porous scaffold loaded with GYY4137 (GYY), an H2S donor, for applications in bone tissue engineering. Here, we assayed whether the combination of SF with H2S potentiates the osteoconductive properties of SF. Biocompatibility and osteoanabolic activity were assayed in vitro using human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells. Cell cultures were performed on a perfusion bioreactor to obtain results closer to the in vivo microenvironment. Cytotoxicity was excluded by lactate dehydrogenase and live/dead assays. Cell colonization and mineral apposition were evaluated by Haematoxylin & Eosin and Von Kossa/Alizarin Red S stainings respectively. PCR array for human osteogenesis and immunohistochemical analyses were performed to identify pathways and targets involved. Our findings show that H2S releasing SF scaffolds supported cell adhesion, proliferation and viability. Moreover, H2S activated genes and proteins involved in ossification, osteoblast differentiation, bone mineral metabolism and angiogenesis allowing a high and early mineralization. Based on these properties, we suggest the use of H2S releasing SF scaffolds for bone healing and regeneration applications.

AB Background Bone regeneration is preferred for bone loss caused by tumors, bone defects, fractures, etc. Recently, mesenchymal stem cells are considered as optimistic tools for bone defect therapy. Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are a promising candidate for regenerative medicine and bone regeneration. Our previous study showed that upregulated circSIPA1L1 during osteogenesis of DPSCs is of significance. In this paper, the potential role of circSIPA1L1 in osteogenesis of DPSCs and its underlying mechanisms are explored. Methods The circular structure of circSIPA1L1 was identified by Sanger sequencing and PCR. Regulatory effects of circSIPA1L1 and miR 617 on mineral deposition in DPSCs were assessed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alizarin red S (ARS) staining and in vivo bone formation assay were conducted to verify the biological influences of circSIPA1L1 on DPSCs. Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression of Smad3. Localization of circSIPA1L1 and miR 617 was confirmed by FISH. Dual luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiments were conducted to investigate the role of the circSIPA1L1/miR 617/Smad3 regulatory axis in osteogenesis of DPSCs. Results Sanger sequencing and back to back primer experiments confirmed the closed loop structure of circSIPA1L1. CircSIPA1L1 could promote the committed differentiation of DPSCs. MiR 617 was predicted to be the target binding circSIPA1L1 through MiRDB, miRTarBase, and TargetScan database analyses, which was further confirmed by dual luciferase reporter assay. FISH results showed that circSIPA1L1 and miR 617 colocalize in the cytoplasm of DPSCs. MiR 617 exerted an inhibitory effect on the osteogenesis of DPSCs. Knockdown of circSIPA1L1 or upregulation of miR 617 downregulated phosphorylated Smad3. In addition, rescue experiments showed that knockdown of miR 617 reversed the inhibitory effect of circSIPA1L1 on osteogenesis of DPSCs. Conclusion CircRNASIPA1L1 promotes osteogenesis of DPSCs by adsorbing miR 617 and further targeting Smad3.

AB Diabetes mellitus is associated with a decrease in bone quality and an increase in fracture incidence. Additionally, treatment with anti diabetic drugs can either adversely or positively affect bone metabolism. In this study we evaluated: the effect of a 3 week oral treatment with saxagliptin on femoral microarchitecture in young male non type 2 diabetic Sprague Dawley rats; and the in vitro effect of saxagliptin and/or fetal bovine serum (PBS), insulin or insulin like growth factor 1 (IGH), on the proliferation, differentiation (Runx2 and PEAR gamma expression, type 1 collagen production, osteocalcin expression, mineralization) and extracellular regulated kinase (ERA) activation, in bone marrow stromal cells (MSC) obtained from control (untreated) rats and in MC3T3E1 osteoblast like cells. In vivo, oral saxagliptin treatment induced a significant decrease in the femoral osteocytic and osteoblastic density of metaphyseal trabecular bone and in the average height of the proximal cartilage growth plate; and an increase in osteoclastic tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity of the primary spongiosa. In vitro, saxagliptin inhibited PBS , insulin  and IGF1 induced ERK phosphorylation and cell proliferation, in both MSC and MC3T3E1 preosteoblasts. In the absence of growth factors, saxagliptin had no effect on ERK activation or cell proliferation. In both MSC and MC3T3E1 cells, saxagliptin in the presence of PBS inhibited Runx2 and osteocalcin expression, type 1 collagen production and mineralization, while increasing PEAR gamma expression. In conclusion, orally administered saxagliptin induced alterations in long bone microarchitecture that could be related to its in vitro down regulation of the ERK signaling pathway for insulin and IGF1 in MSC, thus decreasing the osteogenic potential of these cells.

AB Although painkillers could alleviate some of the symptoms, there are no drugs that really cope with the intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) at present, so it is urgent to find a cure that could prevent or reverse the progression of IDD. During the development of IDD, the cartilaginous end plates (EPs) become hypertrophic and porous by the increase of osteoclast activities, which hinder the penetration of nutrition. The compositional and structural degeneration of the EP may cause both nutritional as well as mechanical impairment to the nucleus pulposus (NP) so that developing drugs that target the degenerating EP may be another option in addition to targeting the NP. In the lumbar spine instability mouse model, we found increased porosity in the cartilaginous EP, accompanied by the decrease in total intervertebral disc volume. Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), a traditional Chinese patent drug with anti osteoclastogenesis effect, could alleviate IDD by inhibiting aberrant osteoclast activation in the porous EP. Further in vitro experiment validated that PNS inhibit the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa Beta ligand induced osteoclast differentiation, while the transcriptional activation of PAX6 may be involved in the mechanism, which had been defined as an inhibitory transcription factor in osteoclastogenesis. These findings may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for IDD.

AB Aim: This study aimed to characterize the cellular basis of the platinum cytotoxicity of two novel platinum complexes, 3Pt and 1Pt, in comparison with that of cisplatin. 3Pt comprises anionic phosphate moieties, while 1Pt comprises neutral aromatic ligands.
   Methods: We compared the cytotoxic potency of 3Pt and 1Pt with that of cisplatin in osteosarcoma cell lines and an orthotopic mouse model.
   Results: The cytotoxic potency of 3Pt was markedly higher than that of cisplatin in all cell lines. Both novel platinum complexes showed a complete lack of cross resistance in cisplatin resistant cells. Caffeine enhanced the cytotoxic potency of these novel platinum complexes, as observed for cisplatin. Apoptosis after drug administration was observed by DNA ladder formation and an annexin V/PI assay. DNA double strand breaks were confirmed by phosphorylation of histone H2AX. In vivo, the antitumor activity of 3Pt and 1Pt was superior and similar, respectively, to that of cisplatin. Both novel platinum complexes exerted strong antitumor effects on osteosarcoma in vitro and in vivo.
   Conclusions: 3Pt may be an effective drug for the treatment of bone cancer because the PO3 moiety has a high affinity to bone, as exhibited by bisphosphonates, and is expected to decrease the incidence of side effects at extraskeletal sites and overcome drug resistance. Cationic 1Pt may also be an effective antitumor drug because of its unique chemical structure and properties. Further investigations to detail the antitumor effects of these ionic Pt complexes on osteosarcoma are warranted.

AB Background With society aging, the rising prevalence of osteoporosis (OP) has enormous social and economic implications. At present, the Zhibai Dihuang pill has been clinically applied in OP treatment and shown significant efficacy, but its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Aims This study was designed to explore the mechanism of the Zhibai Dihuang pill treating OP. Methods In this study, the active ingredients and corresponding targets in the Zhibai Dihuang pill were searched using the TCMSP platform. Based on the mRNA expression data of OP patients in the GEO database, differential expression analysis was conducted by bioinformatics means. By using the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), protein protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, and random walk with restart (RWR) analysis based on seed genes intersected from DEGs and drug target genes was conducted. On this basis, the drug active ingredient gene interaction network was built. The topological property of the network (degree) was statistically analyzed to find the key therapeutic target AKT1 for the treatment of OP. Molecular docking between AKT1 and the active ingredients was conducted, and according to the affinity score, diosgenin was determined as the key small molecule of the Zhibai Dihuang pill in OP treatment. Based on molecular dynamics simulation and cellular thermal shift assay validation, it was found that diosgenin had a good binding ability with AKT1. Results Cell experiments showed that diosgenin could affect the expression of bone markers and the mineralization of extracellular matrix in mouse osteoblasts by inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT1, thus achieving the effect of OP treatment. Conclusion Based on network pharmacology, this study clarified the key small molecule compounds in the Zhibai Dihuang pill and their action targets and preliminarily analyzed the molecular mechanism of the Zhibai Dihuang pill treating OP, providing a theoretical basis for the clinical use of the Zhibai Dihuang pill.

AB Up to 70% of patients with late stage breast cancer have bone metastasis. Current treatment regimens for breast cancer bone metastasis are palliative with no therapeutic cure. Disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) colonize inside the osteogenic niches in the early stage of bone metastasis. Drug delivery into osteogenic niches to inhibit DTC colonization can prevent bone metastasis from entering its late stage and therefore cure bone metastasis. Here, we constructed a 50% DSS6 peptide conjugated nanoparticle to target the osteogenic niche. The osteogenic niche was always located at the endosteum with immature hydroxyapatite. Arsenic manganese nanocrystals (around 14 nm) were loaded in osteogenic niche targeted PEG PLGA nanoparticles with an acidic environment triggered arsenic release. Arsenic formulations greatly reduced 4T1 cell adhesion to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)/preosteoblasts (pre OBs) and osteogenic differentiation of osteoblastic cells. Arsenic formulations also prevented tumor cell colonization and dormancy via altering the direct interaction between 4T1 cells and MSCs/pre OBs. The chemotactic migration of 4T1 cells toward osteogenic cells was blocked by arsenic in mimic 3D osteogenic niche. Systemic administration of osteogenic niche targeted arsenic nanoparticles significantly extended the survival of mice with 4T1 syngeneic bone metastasis. Our findings provide an effective approach for osteogenic niche specific drug delivery and suggest that bone metastasis can be effectively inhibited by blockage of tumor cell colonization in the bone microenvironment.

AB Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are self renewing and multipotent progenitors, which constitute the main cellular compartment of the bone marrow stroma. Because MSCs have an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma, it is essential to know if novel drugs target MSCs. Melflufen is a novel anticancer peptide drug conjugate compound for patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. Here, we studied the cytotoxicity of melflufen, melphalan and doxorubicin in healthy human bone marrow derived MSCs (BMSCs) and how these drugs affect BMSC proliferation. We established co cultures of BMSCs with MM.1S myeloma cells to see if BMSCs increase or decrease the cytotoxicity of melflufen, melphalan, bortezomib and doxorubicin. We evaluated how the drugs affect BMSC differentiation into adipocytes and osteoblasts and the BMSC supported formation of vascular networks. Our results showed that BMSCs were more sensitive to melflufen than to melphalan. The cytotoxicity of melflufen in myeloma cells was not affected by the co culture with BMSCs, as was the case for melphalan, bortezomib and doxorubicin. Adipogenesis, osteogenesis and BMSC mediated angiogenesis were all affected by melflufen. Melphalan and doxorubicin affected BMSC differentiation in similar ways. The effects on adipogenesis and osteogenesis were not solely because of effects on proliferation, seen from the differential expression of differentiation markers normalized by cell number. Overall, our results indicate that melflufen has a significant impact on BMSCs, which could possibly affect therapy outcome.

AB Osteoclasts are involved in bone resorption, and its activation is considered one of the causes of osteoporosis. The pit assay is the principal method for evaluating osteoclast function by measuring hydroxyapatite resorption in vitro. However, the pit assay requires time and trained techniques, including the pit image analysis, and there is no other easy method for evaluating bone resorption. In this study, we developed a novel approach to quantify the bone resorption activity using a calcium phosphate (CaP) coating labeled with fluorescent polyanion. Fluoresceinamine labeled chondroitin polysulfate or Hoechst 33258 labeled deoxyribonucleic acid was used for CaP labeling. When macrophage cell line RAW264 was cultured on the labeled CaP under the stimulation with the receptor activator of the NF kappa B ligand (RANKL), RAW264 cells differentiated into osteoclastic cells and the fluorescence intensity of the culture supernatant and pit area increased in a time  and dose dependent manner. Furthermore, drugs for osteoporosis treatment, such as pamidronate and beta estradiol, inhibited fluorescein release by the cells stimulated with RANKL A positive correlation between the fluorescence intensity and pit area was observed (r = 0.917). These results indicated that this new method using fluorescent polyanion labeled CaP is a standardized useful assay system for the evaluation of bone resorption activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB Immobilization related hypercalcemia is an uncommon finding in patients admitted to intensive care unit. We report a case of severe hypercalcemia in a COVID 19 patient admitted to intensive care unit for hypoxemic respiratory failure. He developed an acute kidney injury requiring continuous renal replacement therapy with regional citrate anticoagulation. Citrate chelates ionized calcium and stop the coagulation cascade locally, preventing filter clotting. Calcium is then given intravenously to a specific target (normocalcemia). It is only when calcium infusion has been stopped that bone resorption and hypercalcemia were unmasked.

AB Background There are several effective therapies for osteoporosis but these agents might cause serious adverse events. Lycopene intake could prevent bone loss, however studies on its effects on bone are scarce. Our aim was to investigate the effects of lycopene on osteoblast cells as well as bone mineral density and bone turnover markers in postmenopausal women. Methods We investigated the effect of lycopene on the Wnt/beta catenin and ERK 1/2 pathways, RUNX2, alkaline phosphatase, RANKL and COL1A of Saos 2. We also carried out a pilot controlled clinical study to verify the feasibility of an approach for bone loss prevention through the intake of a lycopene rich tomato sauce in 39 postmenopausal women. Results Lycopene 10 mu M resulted in higher beta catenin and phERK1/2 protein Vs the vehicle (p = 0.04 and p = 0.006). RUNX2 and COL1A mRNA was induced by both 5 and 10 mu M doses (p = 0.03; p = 0.03 and p = 0.03; p = 0.05) while RANKL mRNA was reduced (p < 0.05). A significant bone density loss was not detected in women taking the tomato sauce while the control group had bone loss (p = 0.002). Tomato sauce intake resulted in a greater bone alkaline phosphatase reduction than the control (18% vs 8.5%, p = 0.03). Conclusions Lycopene activates the WNT/beta catenin and ERK1/2 pathways, upregulates RUNX2, alkaline phosphatase, COL1A and downregulates RANKL Saos 2. These processes contributed to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women.

AB Due to their capability of modifying chromatin structure and thereby regulating gene transcription, histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been reported to play important roles in osteogenesis and considered a promising potential therapeutic target for bone diseases, including osteoporosis. We showed that the novel marine derived HDAC inhibitor largazole exhibits in vitro and in vivo osteogenic activity. Largazole significantly induced the expression of ALP and OPN. The osteogenic activity of largazole was mediated through the increased expression of Runx2 and BMPs. Importantly, largazole showed in vivo bone forming efficacy in the mouse calvarial bone formation assay and the rabbit calvarial bone fracture healing model. The dual action of largazole to stimulate bone formation and inhibit bone resorption would be a useful feature in drug development for bone related disorders.

AB Hydroxyapatite (HA) micro/nano particles show great promise as artificial bone and dental substitutes, or drug carrier systems. However, the precise regulation of hydroxyapatite micro/nano particles with controllable physicochemical properties (such as hierarchical structure, particle size, potential and crystallinity) is still a challenge. Furthermore, the effects of different hierarchical structures on biological responses have been rarely reported. Herein, the HA particles with a precisely tailored micro/nano hierarchical structure have been developed using an elaborate biomimetic synthesis technology. Three representative particles, namely, micro/nano needle like HA particles, micro/nano rod like HA particles, and micro/nano flake like HA particles, were featured to evaluate their biological responses to stem cells. The pore structure facilitated the adsorption of serum adhesive proteins, which together with the unique hierarchical architecture of micro/nano flake like HA particles remarkably promoted the endocytosis efficiency in a concentration dependent manner. The qRT PCR together with RNA seq and western blot analyses showed that micro/nano flake like HA particles more significantly up regulated the expression of genes and production of proteins related to osteogenic differentiation among the three particles through the activated ERK/MAPK signalling pathway. RNA seq further revealed a complex mechanism of cell interface events, suggesting that the hierarchical architecture of HA particles is of crucial importance for the regulation of actin cytoskeleton involved in the modulation of cell adhesion which positively stimulated osteogenic differentiation of stem cells. Moreover, the endocytosis of particles into lysosomes resulted in an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ levels, which activated possible intracellular Ca2+ mediated signaling cascades (Ras/cAMP/Rap1/MAPK signaling pathways) related to osteogenic differentiation of stem cells. Our findings shed light on the effects of different hierarchical structures of HA particles on stem cell differentiation and contribute to the optimal design of implant materials.

AB Rosuvastatin (RSV) is a synthetic statin with favourable pharmacologic properties including minimal metabolism, hepatic selectivity and enhanced inhibition of HMG CoA reductase. An induction of osteoblast differentiation has been reported in vitro with lipophilic statins but not with RSV, which, like pravastatin, is relatively hydrophilic compared with other statins. To mediate its action, an active transport mechanism via solute carrier (SLC) transporters from the SLC16, SLC21/SLCO and SLC22 gene family   specifically Slc16a1, Slco1a1, Slco2b1 and Slc22a8   may be present to allow effective entry in osteoblastic cells. In this study, we demonstrate that RSV induced osteoblast differentiation, as measured by increased BMP 2 gene expression and secretion, and ALP activity in MC3T3 E1 osteoblast cells, without significantly affecting cell proliferation within the concentration range of 0.001 10 mu M. Low concentrations of RSV (0.001 0.01 mu M) were protective against cell death whereas higher concentrations (10 100 mu M) showed cytotoxicity. Moreover, MC3T3 E1 osteoblasts expressed high levels of Slco1a1 and Slc16a1 mRNA and low levels of Slco2b1 and Slc22a8 mRNA, when compared with kidney and liver tissues from mice. Slco1a1 gene expression increased 12 fold during osteoblast differentiation and was further regulated after RSV treatment. In conclusion, as for other statins, RSV promotes osteoblast differentiation, and also, demonstrated for the first time, regulates the expression of Slco1a1, which may constitute the transport system for RSV across the cell membrane in mature osteoblasts.

AB Modulation of osteoclast formation could be a therapeutic target for inhibiting pathological bone destruction. The receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF) & kappa;B ligand (RANKL) is known to be an essential factor in osteoclast differentiation and activation inducers. However, whether Protaetia brevitarsis seulensis (P. brevitarsis) larvae a traditional animal derived medicine used in many Asian countries can inhibit RANKL induced osteoclast for mation and prevent ovariectomy (OVX) induced bone loss has not been evaluated. Here, we aimed to investigate the anti osteoporotic effects of P. brevitarsis larvae ethanol extract (PBE) in RANKL stimulated RAW264.7 cells and OVX mice. In vitro, PBE (0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/mL) decreased RANKL induced tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity and expression of osteoclastogenesis associated genes and proteins. Furthermore, PBE (0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/mL) significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 and NF & kappa;B. Female C3H/HeN mice were divided into five groups (n = 5 per group), namely, sham operated, OVX, OVX+PBEL (100 mg/kg, oral gavage), OVX+PBEH (200 mg/kg, oral gavage), and OVX+estradiol (0.03 & mu;g/day, subcutaneous injection). High doses of PBE significantly increased femoral bone mineral density (BMD) and bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV), whereas femoral bone surface/bone volume (BS/BV) and osteoclastogenesis associated protein expression decreased compared to those in the OVX group. Moreover, PBE (200 mg/kg) significantly increased estradiol and procollagen type I N terminal propeptide and decreased N terminal telopeptide of type I collagen and C terminal telopeptide of type I collagen compared to those in the OVX group. Our results suggest that PBE can be an effective therapeutic candidate for preventing or treating postmenopausal osteoporosis.

AB Background Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) were proved to play a vital role in multiple myeloma (MM). Polygonatum sibiricum polysaccharide (PSP) was found to have anti tumor pharmacological effects, yet its interaction with BMMSCs remained poorly understood. Therefore, we explore the effect of PSP on osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs. Methods BMMSCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. CD90 and CD34 were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). Osteogenic marks were detected by quantitative real time PCR (qRT PCR) and Western blotting (WB). The vitality of cells treated with different concentrations of PSP was observed by Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK 8). ALP staining kit was used to detect the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Alizarin red staining detected the formation of mineralized nodules. Osteoblast associated genes were evaluated by qRT PCR and WB. The phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways were tested by WB. Results The BMMSCs showed good growth under an inverted microscope. FCM showed that CD34 and CD45 was low expressed, whereas CD44, CD90 and CD105 was highly expressed. Compared with the Control group, the expressions of Runx2 and ALP in cells were significantly increased. CCK 8 showed that different concentrations of PSP had no significant effect on the viability of BMMSCs. BMMSCs treated with 25 mg/l PSP were stained the most deeply by ALP. Mineralized nodules in PSP groups dramatically increased, and hit a peak under the action of 25 mg/l PSP. PSP up regulated p PI3K, p AKT, and p mTOR, but had no significant effect on PI3K, AKT, and mTOR. Conclusion PSP induced osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs from MM patients.

TI Glucocorticoids Inhibit Osteocalcin Transcription in Osteoblasts by
   Suppressing Egr2/Krox20 Binding Enhancer

AB Objective. Glucocorticoids are widely used for the management of rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoporosis is a major side effect of glucocorticoid therapy and is attributable to inhibition of bone formation. We developed an osteoblast culture system in which glucocorticoids strongly inhibit development of the osteoblast phenotype, including expression of the bone specific osteocalcin (OC) gene. Using this gene as a model, the goal of this study was to discover glucocorticoid sensitive transcriptional mechanisms in osteoblasts.
   Methods. Dexamethasone (DEX; 1 mu M) was administered to murine MC3T3 E1 osteoblastic cultures under conditions that inhibit mineralized extracellular matrix formation and OC messenger RNA levels by >10 fold. Because standard (short term) transient transfection assays with OC promoter reporter constructs did not recapitulate the strong DEX mediated repression, mapping of OC negative glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) was performed initially by stable transfection and then with long term transient transfection assays. Transcription factor binding to the OC negative GRE was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.
   Results. Several fold repression of OC luciferase constructs was recapitulated in stable and long term transient transfection assays, in which the transfected cells were allowed to progress to a sufficiently advanced developmental stage. Analysis of a 5' promoter deletion series mapped an OC negative GRE to a 15 bp G/C rich of motif ( 161/ 147) located just upstream of the binding site for the osteoblast master transcription factor Runx2. Oligonucleotides encompassing this element and MC3T3 E1 cell extracts formed a protein DNA complex that contained an Egr/Krox family member(s). Complex formation was competed by either an oligonucleotide containing 2 consensus Egr motifs or by anti Egr2/Krox20 antibodies. Three copies of this Krox binding element conferred 20 fold transcriptional activation on the 147 bp basal OC promoter in osteoblasts, and the enhancer activity was inhibited by DEX. Enhancer activity was not observed in 10T1/2 fibroblasts unless these cells were cotransfected with Runx2.
   Conclusion. An Egr2/Krox20 binding site located immediately upstream of the Runx2 site of the mouse OC promoter was identified as an enhancer in osteoblasts, whose activity is repressed by glucocorticoids. Sequence similarity suggests that such a mechanism is likely operative in both murine and human cells. Because glucocorticoids inhibit Egr2/Krox20 expression in osteoblasts, and because trabecular bone formation is arrested in Egr2/Krox20 knockout mice, the inhibition of Egr2/Krox20 activity likely contributes to glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis.

AB Interleukin 1 beta (IL 1 beta) is an inflammatory cytokine produced by monocytes/macrophages and is closely associated with periodontal diseases. The NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in IL 1 beta activation through pro IL 1 beta processing and pyroptotic cell death in bacterial infection. Recently, glyburide, a hypoglycemic sulfonylurea, has been reported to reduce IL 1 beta activation by suppressing activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Therefore, we evaluated the possibility of targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway by glyburide to suppress periodontal pathogen induced inflammation. THP 1 cells (a human monocyte cell line) were differentiated to macrophage like cells by treatment with phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate and stimulated by periodontopathic bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, or Fusobacterium nucleatum, in the presence of glyburide. IL 1 beta and caspase 1 expression in the cells and culture supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and cell death was analyzed by lactate dehydrogenase assay. Stimulation of THP 1 macrophage like cells with every periodontopathic bacteria induced IL 1 beta secretion without cell death, which was suppressed by the NLRP3 inhibitor, MCC950, and caspase 1 inhibitor, z YVAD FMK. Glyburide treatment suppressed IL 1 beta expression in culture supernatants and enhanced intracellular IL 1 beta expression, suggesting that glyburide may have inhibited IL 1 beta secretion. Subsequently, a periodontitis rat model was generated by injecting periodontal bacteria into the gingiva, which was analyzed histologically. Oral administration of glyburide significantly suppressed the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the number of osteoclasts in the alveolar bone compared with the control. In addition to glyburide, glimepiride was shown to suppress the release of IL 1 beta from THP 1 macrophage like cells, whereas other sulfonylureas (tolbutamide and gliclazide) or other hypoglycemic drugs belonging to the biguanide family, such as metformin, failed to suppress IL 1 beta release. Our results suggest that pharmacological targeting of the NLRP3 pathway may be a strategy for suppressing periodontal diseases.

AB Secondary osteoporosis is the major concern associated with long term intake of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Women are the vulnerable targets owing to post menopausal bone loss. In the present work, we evaluated the effect of 10 weeks of treatment with AED therapy (carbamazepine, CBZ, 75 mg/kg; sodium valproate, SVP, 300 mg/kg; levetiracetam, LTM, 150 mg/kg) on bone mineral density and microarchitecture at femoral epiphysis, lumbar vertebrae and proximal tibia of normal and ovariectomised Wistar rats. In addition, we measured serum levels of vitamin D, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa beta ligand (RANKL), procollagen type 1 amino terminal propeptide (P1NP) and wnt inhibitors (sclerostin and DKK 1) following AED therapy. Micro computed tomography analysis of bones revealed significant reduction in BMD at femur epiphysis and lumbar vertebrae with all the three AEDs evaluated. At proximal tibia, only CBZ showed a significant decline. The reduction in BMD was more pronounced in ovariectomised rats. AEDs also resulted in alteration of micro CT parameters. These changes were accompanied by an increased serum RANKL with all AEDs while vitamin D levels were reduced only with CBZ treatment and P1NP levels were reduced with SVP and CBZ. Serum sclerostin levels were elevated following all AEDs in normal and ovariectomised rats except with CBZ in normal rats. However, increase in DKK 1 levels was observed with only LTM. Ovariectomy itself resulted in increased RANKL, sclerostin and DKK 1 and reduced vitamin D and P1NP levels. Significant differences were discernible between normal and ovariectomised rats treated with AEDs in all the parameters. However, while sclerostin increased further upon AEDs treatment, P1NP decreased with SVP and CBZ and serum DKK 1 levels showed a declining trend with all the three AEDs studied. We confirm adverse effects on bone following AEDs in female rats. Further, our results demonstrate for the first time that these effects are more pronounced in ovariectomised rats as compared to normal rats and that this could be related to estrogen deficiency which in turn enhances bone resorption via increased RANKL and reduces bone formation via increased sclerostin and reduced P1NP. Finally, our study demonstrated for the first time that AED treatment displayed changes in the serum levels of wnt inhibitors and hence modulation of wnt inhibitors might be partly involved in their adverse effects on bone.

AB Bone morphogenetic protein 7(BMP 7) plays a pivotal role in the transformation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into bone. However, its impact is hampered due to its short half life. Therefore, gene therapy may be an interesting approach to deliver BMP 7 gene to D1 MSCs. In this manuscript we prepared and characterized niosomes based on cationic lipid 2,3 di(tetradecyloxy)propan 1 amine, combined with polysorbate 80 for gene delivery purposes. Niosomes were characterized and combined initially with pCMS EGFP reporter plasmid, and later with pUNO1 hBMP 7 plasmid to evaluate osteogenesis differentiation. Additionally, specific blockers of most relevant endocytic pathways were used to evaluate the intracellular disposition of complexes. MSCs transfected with niosomes showed increased growth rate, enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and extracellular matrix deposition which suggested the formation of osteoblast like cells. We concluded that hBMP 7 transfected MSCs could be considered not only as an effective delivery tool of hBMP 7, but also as proliferating and bone forming cells for bone regeneration.

AB Osteoporosis is the leading cause of fractures in the population older than 50 years. This silent disease affects primarily postmenopausal women and the elderly, and the morbidity and mortality rates are high. The main goal of treating osteoporosis is the prevention of fractures. The identification of populations at risk through early diagnosis and treatment is essential. The last Brazilian guideline for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was elaborated in 2002. Since then, new strategies for diagnosis and risk stratification have been developed, and drugs with novel action mechanisms have been added to the therapeutic arsenal. The Osteoporosis and Osteometabolic Diseases Committee of the Brazilian Society of Rheumatology, in conjunction with the Brazilian Medical Association and other Societies, has developed this update of the guidelines for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis according to the best scientific evidence available. This update is intended for professionals in many medical and health specialties involved in the treatment of osteoporosis, for physicians in general and for health related organizations.

AB A considerable proportion of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) do not respond to monospecific agents. The purpose of our study was to generate a hybrid form of biologics, targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and interleukin 6 receptor (IL 6R), and determine its anti arthritic properties in vitro and in vivo. A novel dual target directed agent (DTA(A7/sTNFR2)) was generated by conjugating soluble TNF receptor 2 (sTNFR2) to the Fc region of A7, a new anti IL 6R antibody obtained by screening the phage display human antibody library. DTA(A7/sTNFR2) inhibited the proliferation and migration of fibroblast like synoviocytes from patients with RA (RA FLS) more efficiently than single target directed agents. DTA(A7/sTNFR2) also blocked osteoclastogenesis from bone marrow cells. The arthritis severity scores of the experimental arthritis mice with DTA(A7/sTNFR2) tended to be lower than those of mice with IgG, A7, or sTNFR2. Histological data suggested that DTA(A7/sTNFR2) is more efficient than single target drugs in preventing joint destruction and bone loss. These results were confirmed in vivo using the minicircle system. Taken together, the results show that DTA(A7/sTNFR2) may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of RA.

AB The effect of a series of 2 alkylaminoethyl 1,1 bisphosphonic acids against proliferation of the clinically more relevant form of Trypanosonia cruzi, the etiologic agent of American trypanosomiasis (Chagas' disease), and against tachyzoites of Toxo plasma gondii has been studied. Most of these drugs exhibited an extremely potent inhibitory action against the intracellular form of T cruzi, exhibiting IC50 values at the low micromolar level. This cellular activity was associated with a strong inhibition of the enzymatic activity of T cruzi farnesyl diphosphate synthase (TcFPPS), which constitutes a valid target for Chagas' disease chemotherapy. Compound 17 was an effective agent against amastigotes exhibiting an IC50 value of 0.84 mu M, while this compound showed an IC50 value of 0.49 mu M against the target enzyme TcFPPS. Interestingly, compound 19 was very effective against both T cruzi and T. gondii exhibiting TC50 values of 4.1 mu M and 2.6 mu M, respectively. In this case, 19 inhibited at least two different enzymes of T cruzi (TcFPPS and solanesyl diphosphate synthase (TeSPPS); 1.01 mu M and 0.25 mu M, respectively), while it inhibited TgFPPS in T gondii. In general, this family of drugs was less effective against the activity of T cruzi SPPS and against T gondii growth in vitro. As bisphosphonate containing compounds are FDA approved drugs for the treatment of bone resorption disorders, their potential low toxicity makes them good candidates to control tropical diseases.

AB Gastrectomy may disturb the body's mineral homeostasis, with osteopenia and osteoporosis being among the late outcomes. Parathyroid hormone like hormone (PTHLH) was detected in rat gastric enterochromaffin like (ECL) cells in 2005, and some researchers suggested that it was the hypothetical hormone gastrocalcin that is believed to lead to osteoporosis.
   Our objective was to learn whether PTHLH is expressed in human gastric ECL cells and to form a basic understanding about the relationship between PTHLH and gastrin.
   We collected normal human gastric mucosa specimens and serum samples from 28 patients.
   RT PCR and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated weak expression of PTHLH in ECL cells at the RNA and protein levels. A low level of PTHLH expression was also found in the serum. Serum gastrin did have a significant positive correlation with the relative ratio of PTHLH mRNA to beta actin levels in gastric mucosa (r (s) = 0.569, p = 0.002).
   This indicates that PTHLH has a low signal expression in human gastric ECL cells and that serum gastrin levels correlate with PTHLH RNA levels in gastric mucosa. Further work is needed to evaluate the functional role of PTHLH in ECL cells and to determine whether PTHLH is gastrocalcin.

AB Asiatic acid (AA) and asiaticoside, pentacyclic triterpenoid compounds derived from Centella asiatica, are known for their biological effects in promoting type I collagen synthesis and inducing osteogenesis of stem cells. However, their applications in regenerative medicine are limited due to their low potency and poor aqueous solubility. This work aimed to evaluate the osteogenic induction activity of AA derivatives in human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) in vitro. Four compounds were synthesised, namely 501, 502, 503, and 506. AA was used as the control. The 502 exhibited low water solubility, while the 506 compound showed the highest. The cytotoxicity analysis demonstrated that 503 caused significant deterioration in cell viability, while other derivatives showed no harmful effect on hPDLSCs. The dimethyl aminopropyl amine derivative of AA, compound 506, demonstrated a relatively high potency in inducing osteogenic differentiation. An elevated mRNA expression of osteogenic related genes, BMP2, WNT3A, ALP, OSX and IBSP was observed with 506. Additionally, the expression of BMP 2 protein was enhanced with increasing dose of 506, and the effect was pronounced when the Erk signalling molecule was inhibited. The 506 derivative was proposed for the promotion of osteogenic differentiation in hPDLSCs by upregulating BMP2 via the Erk signalling pathway. The 506 molecule showed promise in bone tissue regeneration.

AB Extended bisphosphonate based coordination polymers (BPCPs)wereproduced when 1,1 & PRIME; biphenyl 4,4 & PRIME; bisphosphonic acid(BPBPA), the analogue of 1,1 & PRIME; biphenyl 4,4 & PRIME; dicarboxylicacid (BPDC), reacted with bioactive metals (Ca2+, Zn2+, and Mg2+). BPBPA Ca (11 & ANGS; x 12 & ANGS;),BPBPA Zn (10 & ANGS; x 13 & ANGS;), and BPBPA Mg (8 & ANGS; x11 & ANGS;) possess channels that allow the encapsulation of letrozole(LET), an antineoplastic drug that combined with BPs treats breast cancer inducedosteolytic metastases (OM). Dissolution curves obtained in phosphate bufferedsaline (PBS) and fasted state simulated gastric fluid (FaSSGF) demonstratethe pH dependent degradation of BPCPs. Specifically, the results showthat the structure of BPBPA Ca is preserved in PBS (& SIM;10% releaseof BPBPA) and collapses in FaSSGF. Moreover, the phase inversion temperaturenanoemulsion method yielded nano Ca@BPBPA (& SIM;160d. nm), a material with measurably higher (>1.5x)binding to hydroxyapatite than commercial BPs. Furthermore, it wasfound that the amounts of LET encapsulated and released (& SIM;20wt %) from BPBPA Ca and nano Ca@BPBPA are comparableto those of BPDC based CPs [i.e., UiO 67 (NH2)(2), BPDC Zr, and bio MOF 1], where other antineoplastic drugs havebeen loaded and released under similar conditions. Cell viabilityassays show that, at 12.5 & mu;M, the drug loaded nano Ca@BPBPA exhibits higher cytotoxicity against breast cancer cellsMCF 7 and MDA MB 231 [relative cell viability (%RCV) = 20 & PLUSMN; 1and 45 & PLUSMN; 4%] compared with LET (%RCV = 70 & PLUSMN; 1 and 99 & PLUSMN;1%). At this concentration, no significant cytotoxicity was foundfor the hFOB 1.19 cells treated with drug loaded nano Ca@BPBPA and LET (%RCV = 100 & PLUSMN; 1%). Collectively, these resultsdemonstrate the potential of nano Ca@BPCPs as promisingdrug delivery systems to treat OM or other bone related diseases becausethese present measurably higher affinity, allowing bone targeted drugdelivery under acidic environments and effecting cytotoxicity on estrogenreceptor positive and triple negative breast cancer cell lines knownto induce bone metastases, without significantly affecting normalosteoblasts at the metastatic site.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the combined effect of low level laser treatment (LLLT) and recombinant human bone morphological protein 2 (rhBMP 2) applied to hypoxic cultured MC3T3 E1 osteoblastic cells and to determine possible signaling pathways underlying differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts under hypoxia.
   MC3T3 E1 cells were cultured under 1% oxygen tension for 72 h. Cell cultures were divided into four groups: normoxia control, low level laser (LLL) alone, rhBMP 2 combined with LLLT, and rhBMP 2 under hypoxia. Laser irradiation was applied at 0, 24, and 48 h. Cells were treated with rhBMP 2 at 50 ng/mL. Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured at 3, 7, and 14 days to evaluate osteoblastic differentiation. Cell mineralization was determined with Alizarin red S staining at 7 and 14 days. Western blot assays were performed to evaluate whether p38/protein kinase D (PKD) signaling was involved.
   The results indicate that LLLT and rhBMP 2 synergistically increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization. Western blot analyses showed that expression of type I collagen, runt related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), and Osterix (Osx), increased and expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF 1 alpha), decreased more in the LLLT and rhBMP 2 combined group than in the rhBMP 2 or LLL alone groups. Moreover, LLLT and rhBMP 2 stimulated p38 phosphorylation and rhBMP 2 and LLLT increased Prkd1 phosphorylation.
   Combined treatment with rhBMP 2 and LLL induced differentiation and mineralization of hypoxic cultured MC3T3 E1 osteoblasts by activating p38/PKD signaling in vitro.

AB Introduction: Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is a key integrator of intracellular signals triggered by activated immunoreceptors, including Bcell receptors (BCR) and Fc receptors, which are important for the development and function of lymphoid cells. Given the clinical efficacy of Bcell depletion in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, pharmacological modulation of Bcells using orally active small molecules that selectively target SYK presents an attractive alternative therapeutic strategy. Methods: A SYK inhibitor was developed and assayed in various in vitro systems and in the mouse model of collagen induced arthritis (mCIA). Results: A novel ATP competitive inhibitor of SYK, 6 [(1R,2S) 2 Amino cyclohexylamino] 4 (5,6 dimethyl pyridin 2 ylamino)  pyridazine 3 carboxylic acid amide, designated RO9021, with an adequate kinase selectivity profile and oral bioavailability, was developed. In addition to suppression of BCR signaling in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and whole blood, Fc gamma R signaling in human monocytes, and Fc epsilon R signaling in human mast cells, RO9021 blocked osteoclastogenesis from mouse bone marrow macrophages in vitro. Interestingly, Toll like Receptor (TLR) 9 signaling in human Bcells was inhibited by RO9021, resulting in decreased levels of plasmablasts, immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG upon B cell differentiation. RO9021 also potently inhibited type I interferon production by human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) upon TLR9 activation. This effect is specific to TLR9 as RO9021 did not inhibit TLR4  or JAK STAT mediated signaling. Finally, oral administration of RO9021 inhibited arthritis progression in the mCIA model, with observable pharmacokinetics (PK) pharmacodynamic (PD) correlation. Conclusions: Inhibition of SYK kinase activity impinges on various innate and adaptive immune responses. RO9021 could serve as a starting point for the development of selective SYK inhibitors for the treatment of inflammation related and autoimmune related disorders.

AB Great controversy exists regarding the biologic responses of osteoblasts to X ray irradiation, and the mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, the biological effects of low dose radiation on stimulating osteoblast proliferation, differentiation and fracture healing were identified using in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal studies. First, low dose (0.5 Gy) X ray irradiation induced the cell viability and proliferation of MC3T3 E1 cells. However, high dose (5 Gy) X ray irradiation inhibited the viability and proliferation of osteoblasts. In addition, dynamic variations in osteoblast differentiation markers, including type I collagen, alkaline phosphatase, Runx2, Osterix and osteocalcin, were observed after both low dose and high dose irradiation by Western blot analysis. Second, fracture healing was evaluated via histology and gene expression after single dose X ray irradiation, and low dose X ray irradiation accelerates fracture healing of closed femoral fractures in rats. In low dose X ray irradiated fractures, an increase in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) positive cells, cartilage formation and fracture calluses was observed. In addition, we observed more rapid completion of endochondral and intramembranous ossification, which was accompanied by altered expression of genes involved in bone remodeling and fracture callus mineralization. Although the expression level of several osteoblast differentiation genes was increased in the fracture calluses of high dose irradiated rats, the callus formation and fracture union were delayed compared with the control and low dose irradiated fractures. These results reveal beneficial effects of low dose irradiation, including the stimulation of osteoblast proliferation, differentiation and fracture healing, and highlight its potential translational application in novel therapies against bone related diseases.

AB Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are a promising material for use in regenerative medicine due to their biocompatibility and easy functionalization with biomolecules including growth factors, DNA and peptides. In the present study, transmission electron microscopy indicated that the AuNPs were monodisperse and spherical in shape, with an estimated average diameter of 13 nm. And the cellular effects of AuNPs on the osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) and the associated signaling pathways in cell differentiation were investigated based on histochemical analysis of alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blotting. The results indicated that AuNPs enhanced the differentiation of hPDLSCs into osteoblasts, increasing their osteogenic transcriptional profile including alkaline phosphatase, osterix, collagen type I and runt related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and activating the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Furthermore, AuNPs increased the protein level of RUNX2, which is crucial for osteogenic differentiation. These results suggested that AuNPs stimulate the osteogenesis of hPDLSCs partially via activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.

AB In the present study a new strategy of synthesis was developed for nanostructured calcium phosphates, such as hydroxyapatite (HAP) or silicon, magnesium and zinc modified hydroxyapatites of controlled characteristics (such as the shape and size of nanoparticles, porosity and crystallinity) by precipitation reactions. These inorganic powders were jointly used with chitosan (CHI) and collagen type I (COL) to manufacture fibrous biocomposite scaffolds made of self assembled layers by using layer by layer technique for cell cultures. The resulting materials were characterized by using X ray diffraction, SEM, TEM and AFM. This work also reports the structural data obtained on the surface of the newly prepared nanostructured porous scaffolds made of self assembled nanoHAP Si(0.2%) Mg(0.6%) Zn(02%)/CHI/COL layers at 7 days in human osteoblastic cell culture. A new porous structure was found by SEM imaging on the surface of these scaffolds due to the cells and scaffold interactions. This structure is apparently similar to the bone tissue. Our data have indicated that the incorporation of small amounts of silicon, magnesium and zinc within the nanoHAP lattice improved the biological activity of human osteoblasts on these scaffolds, in vitro. The data have revealed the high importance of HAP nanostructure and its composition in the preparation of fibrous scaffolds with potential applications in particle technology, bone tissue engineering and nano medicine.

AB The combination of models for protein target prediction with large databases containing toxicological information for individual molecules allows the derivation of "toxicological" profiles, i.e., to what extent are molecules of known toxicity predicted to interact with a set of protein targets. To predict protein targets of drug like and toxic molecules, we built it computational multiclass model using the Winnow algorithm based on a dataset of protein targets derived from the MDL Drug Data Report. A 15 fold Monte Carlo cross validation using 50% of each class for training, and the remaining 50% for testing, provided an assessment of the accuracy of that model. We retained the 3 top ranking predictions and found that in 82% of all cases the correct target was predicted within these three predictions. The first prediction was the correct one in almost 70% of cases. A model built on the whole protein target dataset was then used to predict the protein targets for 150000 molecules front the MDL Toxicity Database. We analysed the frequency of the predictions across the panel of protein targets for experimentally determined toxicity classes of all molecules. This allowed us to identify clusters of proteins related by their toxicological profiles, as well as toxicities that are related. literature based evidence is provided for some specific clusters to show the relevance of the relationships identified.

AB Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), are the basic cellular components that make up the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the morphology and function of MSCs changes in accordance with the transformation of the BMM. Moreover, the transformation of MSCs into osteoblasts is determined through the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway, ultimately leading to an altered expression of the downstream adhesion molecule, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). In this study, we aimed to explore the interaction of possible pathways in AML derived mesenchymal stem cells (AML MSCs) co cultured with the K562 and K562 ADM cell lines. AML MSCs were co cultured with K562/K562 ADM cells, and the interactions between the cells were verified by morphological detection, peroxidase staining (POX), reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The proliferation of K562/K562 ADM cells under co culture conditions was detected by flow cytometry. The expression levels of BMP4 and CTGF were examined by RT qPCR and western blot (WB) analysis. The detection of interleukin (IL) 6 and IL 32 was also determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the co culture system, the K562 ADM cells underwent fusiform transformation. The occurrence of this transformation was associated with an increased expression of CTGF due to the dysregulation of the BMP pathway. The AML MSCs promoted the proliferation of the K562 ADM cell, but inhibited that of the K562 cells. These findings were confirmed by changes in the expression of the soluble cytokines, IL 6 and IL 32. On the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that AML MSCs regulate the expression of CTGF through the BMP pathway. In addition, they affect cytokine production, induce spindle shaped transformation, and increase drug resistance in the K562 ADM cells. Thus, the morphological transformation through the BMP pathway provides us with a novel target with which to circumvent tumor occurrence, development, drug resistance, invasion and metastasis.

TI Correlation of baseline biomarkers with clinical outcomes and response
   to fulvestrant with vandetanib or placebo in patients with bone

AB Background: Bone metastases are common in women with breast cancer and often result in skeletal related events (SREs). As the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) regulates osteoclast activity and is associated with more extensive bone metastases and SRE risk in metastatic breast cancer, we hypothesized that blockade of VEGF signaling could be a therapeutic strategy for inhibiting bone metastases progression and possibly prolonging overall (OS) or progression free survival (PFS). The Zamboney trial was a randomized placebo controlled study designed to assess whether patients with bone predominant metastatic breast cancer benefited from addition of the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) targeting agent, vandetanib, to endocrine therapy with fulvestrant. As a companion study, evaluation of biomarkers and their potential association with response to vandetanib or SRE risk was performed.
   Methods: Baseline overnight fasted serum from enrolled patients was analyzed for levels of various putative biomarkers including; VEGF A, soluble (s)VEGFR2, sVEGFR3, transforming growth factor (TGF) beta 1 and activinA by ELISA. Spearman correlation coefficients and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to investigate potential relationships between biomarker values and baseline clinical parameters. Prognostic and predictive ability of each marker was investigated using Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustments for treatment and baseline strata of serum CTx ( < 400 versus >= 400 ng/L).
   Results: Of 129 enrolled patients, serum was available for analysis in 101; 51 in vandetanib and 50 in placebo arm. Mean age amongst consenting patients was 59.8 years. Clinical characteristics were not significantly different between patients with or without serum biomarker data and serum markers were similar for patients by treatment arm. Baseline sVEGFR2 was prognostic for OS (HR=0.77, 95% CI=0.61 0.96, p=0.020), and although a modest association was observed, it was not significant for PFS (HR=0.90, 95% CI=0.80 1.01, p=0.085) nor time to first SRE (HR=0.82, 95% CI=0.66 1.02, p=0.079). When interaction terms were evaluated, sVEGFR2 was not found to be predictive of response to vandetanib, although a modest association remained with respect to PFS (interaction p=0.085). No other marker showed any significant prognostic or predictive ability with any measured outcome.
   Conclusions: In this clinical trial, sVEGFR2 appeared prognostic for OS, hence validation of sVEGFR2 should be conducted. Moreover, the role of sVEGFR2 in breast cancer bone metastasis progression should be elucidated. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

TI Correction of Vertebral Bone Development in Ectodysplasin A1 Deficient

AB X linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with the cardinal symptoms hypodontia, hypotrichosis and hypohidrosis is caused by a genetic deficiency of ectodysplasin A1 (EDA1). Prenatal EDA1 replacement can rescue the development of skin appendages and teeth. Tabby mice, a natural animal model of EDA1 deficiency, additionally feature a striking kink of the tail, the cause of which has remained unclear. We studied the origin of this phenomenon and its response to prenatal therapy. Alterations in the distal spine could be noticed soon after birth, and kinks were present in all Tabby mice by the age of 4 months. Although their vertebral bones frequently had a disorganized epiphyseal zone possibly predisposing to fractures, cortical bone density was only reduced in vertebrae of older Tabby mice and even increased in their tibiae. Different availability of osteoclasts in the spine, which may affect bone density, was ruled out by osteoclast staining. The absence of hair follicles, a well known niche of epidermal stem cells, and much lower bromodeoxyuridine uptake in the tail skin of 9 day old Tabby mice rather suggest the kink being due to a skin proliferation defect that prevents the skin from growing as fast as the skeleton, so that caudal vertebrae may be squeezed and bent by a lack of skin. Early postnatal treatment with EDA1 leading to delayed hair follicle formation attenuated the kink, but did not prevent it. Tabby mice born after prenatal administration of EDA1, however, showed normal tail skin proliferation, no signs of kinking and, interestingly, a normalized vertebral bone density. Thus, our data prove the causal relationship between EDA1 deficiency and kinky tails and indicate that hair follicles are required for murine tail skin to grow fast enough. Disturbed bone development appears to be partially pre determined in utero and can be counteracted by timely EDA1 replacement, pointing to a role of EDA1 also in osteogenesis.

AB For individuals who have experienced tooth loss, dental implants are an important treatment option for oral reconstruction. For these patients, alveolar bone augmentation and acceleration of osseointegration optimize implant stability. Traditional oral surgery often requires invasive procedures, which can result in prolonged treatment time and associated morbidity. It has been previously shown that chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization of functionalized [2.2]paracyclophanes can be used to anchor gene encoding vectors onto biomaterial surfaces and local delivery of a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) encoding vector can increase alveolar bone volume and density in vivo. This study is the first to combine the use of CVD technology and BMP gene delivery on titanium for the promotion of bone regeneration and bone to implant contact in vivo. BMP 7 tethered to titanium surface enhances osteoblast cell differentiation and alkaline phosphatase activity in vitro and increases alveolar bone regeneration and % bone to implant contact similar to using high doses of exogenously applied BMP 7 in vivo. The use of this innovative gene delivery strategy on implant surfaces offers an alternative treatment option for targeted alveolar bone reconstruction.

AB Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) was originally identified as xenobiotic sensor that regulates the expression of cytochrome P450 genes. However, recent studies suggest that this nuclear receptor is also involved in the regulation of energy metabolism including glucose and lipid homeostasis. This study investigated the role of CAR in the regulation of bone mass in vivo using CAR( / ) mice. Endogenous mRNA expression of CAR was observed in both primary osteoblasts and osteoclast precursors. CAR( / ) mice have exhibited significant increase in whole body bone mineral density (BMD) by 9.5% (P<0.01) and 5.5% (P<0.05) at 10 and 15 weeks of age, respectively, compared with WT mice in males. Microcomputed tomography analysis of proximal tibia demonstrated a significant increase in trabecular bone volume (62.7%), trabecular number (54.1%) in male CAR( / ) mice compared with WT mice. However, primary culture of calvarial cells exhibited no significant changes in osteogenic differentiation potential between CAR( / ) and WT. In addition, the number of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase positive osteoclasts in the femur and serum level of CTx was not different between CAR( / ) and WT mice. The higher BMD and microstructural parameters were not observed in female mice. Interestingly, serum level of testosterone in male CAR( / ) mice was 2.5 fold higher compared with WT mice and the mRNA expressions of Cyp2b9 and 2b10 in the liver, which regulate testosterone metabolism, were significantly down regulated in male CAR( / ) mice. Furthermore, the difference in BMD between CAR( / ) and WT mice disappeared at 8 weeks after performing orchiectomy. CAR( / ) mice also exhibited significant increase in serum 1,25(OH)(2)D 3 levels but Cyp 27B1 which converts 25(OH)D 3 to 1,25(OH)(2)D 3 was significantly down regulated compared to WT mice. These results suggest that in vivo deletion of CAR resulted in higher bone mass, which appears to be a result from reduced metabolism of testosterone due to down regulation of Cyp2b. J. Cell.

AB Objective: Bone morphogenic protein (BMP) 2 is approved for fracture non union and spine fusion. We aimed to further dissect its downstream signaling events in chondrocytes with the ultimate goal to develop novel therapeutics that can mimic BMP 2 effect but have less complications.
   Methods: BMP 2 effect on cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 expression was examined using Real time quantitative PCR (RT PCR) and Western blot analysis. Genetic approach was used to identify the signaling pathway mediating the BMP 2 effect. Similarly, the pathway transducing the PGE2 effect on ATF4 was investigated. Immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed to assess the complex formation after PGE2 binding.
   Results: BMP 2 increased COX 2 expression in primary mouse costosternal chondrocytes (PMCSC). The results from the C9 Tet off system demonstrated that endogenous BMP 2 also upregulated COX 2 expression. Genetic approaches using PMCSC from ALK2(fx/fx), ALK3(fx/fx), ALK6( / ), and Smad1(fx/fx) mice established that BMP 2 regulated COX 2 through activation of ALK3 Smad1 signaling. PGE 2 EIA showed that BMP 2 increased PGE2 production in PMCSC. ATF4 is a transcription factor that regulates bone formation. While PGE2 did not have significant effect on ATF4 expression, it induced ATF4 phosphorylation. In addition to stimulating COX 2 expression, BMP 2 also induced phosphorylation of ATF4. Using COX 2 deficient chondrocytes, we demonstrated that the BMP 2 effect on ATF4 was COX 2 dependent. Tibial fracture samples from COX 2( / ) mice showed reduced phospho ATF4 immunoreactivity compared to wild type (WT) ones. PGE2 mediated ATF4 phosphorylation involved signaling primarily through the EP2 and EP4 receptors and PGE2 induced an EP4 ERK1/2 RSK2 complex formation.
   Conclusions: BMP 2 regulates COX 2 expression through ALK3 Smad1 signaling, and PGE2 induces ATF4 phosphorylation via EP4 ERK1/2 RSK2 axis. (C) 2014 Osteoarthritis Research Society International. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The frequency of osteoclast precursors OCPF) and the presence of bone marrow oedema BMO) are potential response biomarkers in psoriatic arthritis PsA). Previous studies suggest a central role for tumour necrosis factor TNF) in the formation of osteoclast precursors. To better understand this association, the effect of etanercept on OCPF and BMO was analysed in PsA patients with erosive arthritis.
   Methods: A total of 20 PsA patients with active erosive PsA were enrolled. Etanercept was administered twice weekly for 24 weeks. OCPF was measured and clinical assessments were performed at baseline, 2, 12 and 24 weeks. Gadolinium enhanced MR images were obtained at baseline and 24 weeks.
   Results: Significant improvements in joint score p < 0.001), HAQ scores p < 0.001) and SF 36 parameters were observed after 6 months of therapy with etanercept compared to baseline. The median OCPF decreased from 24.5 to 9 p = 0.04) and to 7 p = 0.006) after 3 months and 6 months of treatment, respectively. MR images were available for 13 patients. The BMO volume decreased in 47 and increased in 31 sites at 6 months. No correlation was noted between OCPF, BMO and clinical parameters.
   Conclusion: The rapid decline in OCPF and overall improvement in BMO after anti TNF alpha therapy provides one mechanism to explain the anti erosive effects of TNF blockade in PsA. Persistence of BMO after etanercept treatment, despite a marked clinical response, was unexpected, and suggests ongoing subchondral inflammation or altered remodelling in PsA bone.

AB The osteopetroses are a heterogeneous group of sclerosing bone dysplasias with an increased bone density due to an osteoclast defect, with consequently recurrent fractures. Different forms have been described with radiological and clinical features varying from mild to severe with a very poor prognosis. Thus far, six genes have been associated with osteopetrosis and these will be discussed in this review. Except for one gene with a function in osteoclast differentiation, all identified genes encode proteins that play a role in the resorption process. This review additionally focuses on the current treatments for osteopetrosis. In this light, it is crucial that a precise diagnosis be made before therapy is attempted. Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of these conditions greatly contribute to making the exact diagnosis and selecting the most appropriate type of treatment.

AB Stem cell fate can be directed through the application of various external physical stimuli, enabling a controlled approach to targeted differentiation. Studies involving the use of dynamic mechanical cues driven by vibrational excitation to date have, however, been limited to low frequency (Hz to kHz) forcing over extended durations (typically continuous treatment for >7 days). Contrary to previous assertions that there is little benefit in applying frequencies beyond 1 kHz, we show here that high frequency MHz order mechanostimulation in the form of nanoscale amplitude surface reflected bulk waves are capable of triggering differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells from various donor sources toward an osteoblast lineage, with early, short time stimuli inducing long term osteogenic commitment. More specifically, rapid treatments (10 min daily over 5 days) of the high frequency (10 MHz) mechanostimulation are shown to trigger significant upregulation in early osteogenic markers (RUNX2, COL1A1) and sustained increase in late markers (osteocalcin, osteopontin) through a mechanistic pathway involving piezo channel activation and Rho associated protein kinase signaling. Given the miniaturizability and low cost of the devices, the possibility for upscaling the platform toward practical bioreactors, to address a pressing need for more efficient stem cell differentiation technologies in the pursuit of translatable regenerative medicine strategies, is ensivaged.

AB Inhibitors of prostaglandin production, designated as classical non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) and acting on the base of non selective inhibition of cyclooxygenases, have been found in numerous studies to potentiate recovery of perturbed haematopoiesis by removing the negative feedback control mediated by prostaglandins. However, classical NSAIDs show pronounced undesirable gastrointestinal side effects, which limits the possibility of their utilization for various pathophysiological states including myelosuppression. Specific cyclooxygenase 2 ( COX 2) inhibitors, targeted at selective inhibition of this inducible cyclooxygenase isoform and having much better gastrointestinal side effect profile, have been found in recent studies to retain the haematopoiesis stimulating effects of classical NSAIDs. These results suggest that the indication spectrum of selective COX 2 inhibitors may be extended to the indication of myelosuppression of various etiology. Combining the anti tumour and haematopoiesis stimulating activities in a single COX 2 inhibitor may have a positive clinical impact. (c) Versita Warsaw and Springer Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB Extracellular matrix (ECM) has been used as a biologic scaffold material to both reinforce the surgical repair of soft tissue and serve as an inductive template to promote a constructive tissue remodeling response. Success of such an approach is dependent on macrophage mediated degradation and remodeling of the biologic scaffold. Macrophage phenotype during these processes is a predictive factor of the eventual remodeling outcome. ECM scaffolds have been shown to promote an anti inflammatory or M2 like macrophage phenotype in vitro that includes secretion of downstream products of cycolooxygenases 1 and 2 (COX1/2). The present study investigated the effect of a common COX1/2 inhibitor (Aspirin) on macrophage phenotype and tissue remodeling in a rodent model of ECM scaffold treated skeletal muscle injury. Inhibition of COX1/2 reduced the constructive remodeling response by hindering myogenesis and collagen deposition in the defect area. The inhibited response was correlated with a reduction in M2 like macrophages in the defect area. The effects of Aspirin on macrophage phenotype were corroborated using an established in vitro macrophage model which showed a reduction in both ECM induced prostaglandin secretion and expression of a marker of M2 like macrophages (CD206). These results raise questions regarding the common peri surgical administration of COX1/2 inhibitors when biologic scaffold materials are used to facilitate muscle repair/regeneration.
   Statement of significance
   COX1/2 inhibitors such as nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are routinely administered post surgically for analgesic purposes. While COX1/2 inhibitors are important in pain management, they have also been shown to delay or diminish the healing process, which calls to question their clinical use for treating musculotendinous injuries. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of a common NSAID, Aspirin, on the constructive remodeling response mediated by an ECM scaffold (UBM) in a rat skeletal muscle injury model.
   The COX1/2 inhibitor, Aspirin, was found to mitigate the ECM scaffold mediated constructive remodeling response both in an in vitro co culture system and an in vivo rat model of skeletal muscle injury. The results presented herein provide data showing that NSAIDs may significantly alter tissue remodeling outcomes when a biomaterial is used in a regenerative medicine/tissue engineering application. Thus, the decision to prescribe NSAIDs to manage the symptoms of inflammation post ECM scaffold implantation should be carefully considered.

AB Bone defects have become a major cause of disability and death. To overcome the limitations of natural bone implants, including donor shortages and immune rejection risks, bone tissue engineering (BTE) scaffolds have emerged as a promising therapy for bone defects. Despite possessing good biocompatibility, these metal, ceramic and polymer based scaffolds are still challenged by the harsh conditions in bone defect sites. ROS accumulation, bacterial infection, excessive inflammation, compromised blood supply deficiency and tumor recurrence negatively impact bone tissue cells (BTCs) and hinder the osteointegration of BTE scaffolds. Phenolic compounds, derived from plants and fruits, have gained growing application in treating inflammatory, infectious and agingrelated diseases due to their antioxidant ability conferred by phenolic hydroxyl groups. The prevalent interactions between phenols and functional groups also facilitate their utilization in fabricating scaffolds. Consequently, phenols are increasingly incorporated into BTE scaffolds to boost therapeutic efficacy in bone defect. This review demonstrated the effects of phenols on BTCs and bone defect microenvironment, summarized the intrinsic mechanisms, presented the advances in phenol modified BTE scaffolds and analyzed their potential risks in practical applications. Overall, phenol modified BTE scaffolds hold great potential for repairing bone defects, offering novel patterns for BTE scaffold construction and advancing traumatological medicine.

AB The clinical need for effective bone regeneration remains in huge demands. Although autologous and allogeneic bone grafts are generally considered "gold standard" treatments for bone defects, these approaches may result in various complications. Furthermore, safety considerations of gene  and cell based therapies require further clarification and approval from regulatory authorities. Therefore, developing new therapeutic biomaterials that can empower endogenous regenerative properties to accelerate bone repair and regeneration is of great significance. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) comprise a heterogeneous population of naturally derived nanoparticles that play a critical role in mediating cell cell communication. The vast amount of biological processes that EVs are involved in, such as immune modulation, senescence, and angiogenesis, and the versatility of manner in which they can influence the behavior of recipient cells make EVs an interesting source for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Advancement of knowledge in the fields of immunology and cell biology has sparked the exploration of the potential of EVs in the field of regenerative medicine. EVs travel between cells and deliver functional cargoes, such as proteins and RNAs, thereby regulating the recruitment, proliferation, and differentiation of recipient cells. Numerous studies have demonstrated the pivotal role of EVs in tissue regeneration both in vitro and in vivo. In this chapter, we will outline current knowledge surrounding EVs, summarize their functional roles in bone regenerative medicine, and elaborate on potential application and challenges of EV integrated biomaterials in bone tissue engineering.

AB Venous thromboembolism (VTE), osteonecrosis of the jaw, renal failure, and anemia are all common complications of multiple myeloma therapy. Many of these adverse events have been documented only in the past 5 to 10 years, in conjunction with the introduction of a series of the newer therapies thalidomide, bortezomib, and lenalidomide. This article discusses these complications in detail and provides strategies for health care providers to best prevent, identify, and manage them. Preventive measures, such as VTE prophylaxis and appropriate dental hygiene, as well as patient education, dose adjustments, limited duration of drug treatment, and consideration of therapies that are associated with less burdensome adverse event profiles, can contribute to substantially improved outcomes and quality of life.

TI Increased Marrow Adiposity in Premenopausal Women with Idiopathic
   Osteoporosis
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
LA English
DT Article
ID BONE MINERAL DENSITY; PROTON MR SPECTROSCOPY; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR;
   TISSUE VOLUME; FAT; ADIPOCYTES; MECHANISMS; THERAPY; MICE
AB Context: We have previously reported that premenopausal women with idiopathic osteoporosis based on fractures (IOP) or idiopathic low bone mineral density (ILBMD) exhibit markedly reduced bone mass, profoundly abnormal trabecular microstructure, and significant deficits in trabecular bone stiffness. Bone remodeling was heterogeneous. Those with low bone turnover had evidence of osteoblast dysfunction and the most marked deficits in microstructure and stiffness.
   Objective: Because osteoblasts and marrow adipocytes derive from a common mesenchymal precursor and excess marrow fat has been implicated in the pathogenesis of bone fragility in anorexia nervosa, glucocorticoid excess, and thiazolidinedione exposure, we hypothesized that marrow adiposity would be higher in affected women and inversely related to bone mass, microarchitecture, bone formation rate, and osteoblast number.
   Design: We analyzed tetracycline labeled transiliac biopsy specimens in 64 premenopausal women with IOP or ILBMD and 40 controls by three dimensional micro computed tomography and two dimensional quantitative histomorphometry to assess marrow adipocyte number, perimeter, and area.
   Results: IOP and ILBMD subjects did not differ with regard to any adipocyte parameter, and thus results were combined. Subjects had substantially higher adipocyte number (by 22%), size (by 24%), and volume (by 26%) than controls (P < 0.0001 for all). Results remained significant after adjusting for age, body mass index, and bone volume. Controls demonstrated expected direct associations between marrow adiposity and age and inverse relationships between marrow adiposity and bone formation, volume, and microstructure measures. No such relationships were observed in the subjects.
   Conclusions: Higher marrow adiposity and the absence of expected relationships between marrow adiposity and bone microstructure and remodeling in women with IOP or ILBMD suggest that the relationships between fat and bone are abnormal; excess marrow fat may not arise from a switch from the osteoblast to the adipocyte lineage in this disorder. Whether excess marrow fat contributes to the pathogenesis of this disorder remains unclear. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 97: 2782 2791, 2012)

AB Introduction: Immunotherapy and targeted therapy have extended life expectancy in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, shifting it into a chronic condition with comorbidities, including osteoporosis. This study aims to evaluate the prevalence and incidence of osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OPVF) during NSCLC follow up, identify risk factors of OPVF, and determine the impact on overall survival (OS). Methods: We performed a longitudinal single center retrospective cohort study involving patients with histologically proven NSCLC of any stage. Chest abdomen pelvis computed tomography (CAP CT) at diagnosis and during follow up were double blind reviewed to determine OPVF site, count, type, time to incident OPVF, and trabecular volumetric bone density (TVBD). An institutional expert committee adjudicated discrepancies. Binary logistic regression was used to predict the occurrence of incident OPVF. OS was calculated using the Kaplan Meier method. Results: We included 289 patients with a median follow up of 29.7 months. OPVF prevalence was 10.7% at inclusion and 23.2% at the end of follow up. Cumulative incidence was 12.5%, with an incidence rate of 4 per 100 patient years. Median time to incident OPVF was 13 months (IQR: 6.7 21.2). Seven of the 36 patients with incident OPVF received denosumab or bisphosphonates. In multivariable analysis, independent risk factors for incident OPVF were BMI < 19 kg/m(2) (OR: 5.62, 95%CI 1.84 17.20, p = 0.002), lower TVBD (OR: 0.982 per HU, 95%CI 0.97 0.99, p = 0.001) and corticosteroid use (OR: 4.77, 95%CI: 1.76 12.89, p = 0.001). OPVF was not significantly associated with OS. Conclusions: Osteoporosis should be screened for in NSCLC patients. Thoracic oncologists must broaden the use of steroid induced osteoporosis recommendations.

AB Gene therapy can be combined with tissue engineering constructs to produce gene activated matrices (GAMs) with enhanced capacity for repair. Polyethyleneimine (PEI), a non viral vector, has previously been optimised for high efficiency gene transfer in rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs). The use of PEI to transfect human MSCs (hMSCs) with ephrinB2 is assessed here. Recently a role for the ephrinB2 ligand and EphB4 receptor duo has been proposed in bone remodelling. Herein, over expression of the ephrinB2 ligand resulted in increased osteogenic differentiation in hMSCs. As ephrinB2 is a cell surface anchored ligand which only interacts with cells expressing the cognate EphB4 receptor through direct contact, we have shown that direct cell cell contact between two neighbouring cells is responsible for enhanced osteogenesis. In an effort to begin to elucidate the molecular mechanisms at play downstream of ephrinB2 over expression, RT PCR was performed on the GAMs which revealed no significant changes in runx2 or BMP2 expression but an upregulation of osterix (Osx) and Dlx5 expression prompting the belief that the mode of osteogenesis is independent of the BMP2 pathway. This select interaction, coupled with the transient gene expression profile of PEI, makes the PEI ephrinB2 GAM an ideal candidate matrix for a bone targeted GAM. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB The most widely used synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (DEX), causes stunted growth in children when used excessively or for long periods of time; however, there are still plenty of pediatric patients require long term treatment with DEX. As an alternative, growth hormone is used in combination, but it has side effects, a high cost, and psychological factors, and it is not satisfactory in terms of effectiveness. It is necessary to develop a safe and affordable treatment that can replace it. The Korean Food and Drug Administration approved HT042, a standardized functional food ingredient, with the claim that it can help height growth of children. In this study, it was found that HT042 activated the Indian hedgehog/parathyroid hormone related protein signaling pathway and enhanced the number of growth hormone receptors and insulin like growth factor 1 receptors on the growth plate surface, which were reduced by DEX treatment, and restored growth retardation. In metatarsal bone and primary chondrocyte models, it was found that HT042 can promote the length of growth plate and recover DEX induced growth retardation. It was also found that HT042 promotes cell proliferation using bromodeoxyuridine and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assays; moreover, we verified increased expression of GHR/IGF 1R and Ihh/PTHrP pathway activity using qRT PCR, western blotting, and siRNA analyses to verify its direct action on the growth plate. The anti apoptotic effect of HT042 was identified by regulating the expression of apoptotic factors such as caspase 3, Bcl2, Bclx, and Bax. These results were identified using both ex vivo and in vitro models. Our study verified that co administration of HT042 could recover the DEX induced growth retardation

AB Study Design.Translational research. Objective.To evaluate the relative effects of NSAIDs, opioids, and a combination of the two on spinal fusion inhibition in a rodent model. Summary of Background Data.Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids are common postoperative analgesic agents. Since NSAIDs inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway, they are seldom prescribed following spinal fusion. Opioids may be given instead, but recent evidence suggests opioids also adversely affect spinal fusion quality and success. Methods.Eighty male Sprague Dawley rats underwent L4 5 posterior lumbar fusion and were given one of the following analgesia regimens: saline, morphine (6 mg/kg), ketorolac (4 mg/kg), or morphine (3 mg/kg) and ketorolac (2 mg/kg). Serum samples were drawn to evaluate systemic pro osteoblastic cytokines and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF A) levels, which were measured through enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). After six weeks, the rats were sacrificed, and the operated spinal segments underwent manual palpation, microCT, and histologic analysis. Results.Manual palpation scores were significantly diminished in the opioid, NSAID, and multimodal groups when compared with control (P<0.001). MicroCT fusion scores (P<0.001) and fusion rates (control: 75% vs. NSAID: 35% vs. opioid: 0% vs. combination: 15%, P<0.001) were significantly diminished in the treatment groups. The bone volume (BV) to tissue volume (TV) ratio (BV/TV) (P<0.001) and bone mineral density (BMD) (P<0.001) were all lower in the treatment groups, with the opioid and combined groups having the lowest BMD. Although statistically insignificant (P<0.09), the concentration of VEGF A was greater in the control group compared with opioids, NSAIDs, and the combined group. Conclusion.Opioids and NSAIDs, both independently and combined, inhibited spinal fusion and caused inferior bony callus. Administration of opioids resulted in the lowest rate of spinal fusion. We propose this may be due to the inhibition of VEGF A, which limits angiogenesis to the burgeoning fusion mass.

AB PurposeTo develop a novel nomogram for determining radium 223 dichloride (Ra 223) treatment suitability for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. MethodsThis Japanese Ra 223 Therapy in Prostate Cancer using Bone Scan Index (J RAP BSI) Trial was a retrospective multicenter investigation enrolled 258 mCRPC patients in Japan with Ra 223 treatment between June 2016 and August 2020, with bone scintigraphy findings before treatment, clinical data, and survival outcome available. A nomogram was constructed using prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) based on a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression model. A sub analysis was also conducted for patients meeting European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines. ResultsWithin a median of 17.4 months after initial Ra 223 treatment, 124 patients (48.1%) died from prostate cancer. Predictive factors included (1) sum of prior treatment history (score 0, never prior novel androgen receptor targeted agents (ARTA) therapy, never prior taxane based chemotherapy, and ever prior bisphosphonate/denosumab treatment), (2) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, (3) prostate specific antigen doubling time (PSADT), (4) hemoglobin, (5) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and (6) alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, and (7) automated bone scan index (aBSI) value based on bone scintigraphy. The nomogram using those factors showed good discrimination, with apparent and optimism corrected Harrell's concordance index values of 0.748 and 0.734, respectively. Time dependent area under the curve values at 1, 2, and 3 years were 0.771, 0.818, and 0.771, respectively. In 227 patients meeting EMA recommendation, the nomogram with seven factors showed good discrimination, with apparent and optimism corrected Harrell's concordance index values of 0.722 and 0.704, respectively. Time dependent area under the curve values at 1, 2, and 3 years were 0.747, 0.790, and 0.759, respectively. ConclusionThis novel nomogram including aBSI to select mCRPC patients to receive Ra 223 with significantly prolonged OS possibility was found suitable for assisting therapeutic decision making, regardless of EMA recommendation.

AB Mineral and bone disorders frequently cause cardiovascular complications and mortality in hemodialysis patients, but few observational studies of Japanese patients have investigated this matter. A retrospective cohort study of 99 patients (53 males, 46 females; mean age: 65 +/  12 year; 38% with diabetes mellitus) on maintenance hemodialysis in our dialysis center was conducted. Mean serum Ca, P and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels were 9.2 +/  0.9 mg/dL, 6.1 +/  1.7 mg/dL, and 233 +/  333 pg/mL, respectively. The cutoff values for each of these three parameter were defined according to the target ranges recommended by the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy (JSDT) guidelines (Ca: 8.4 10.0 mg/dL; P: 3.5 6.0 mg/dL; iPTH: 60 180 pg/mL). During a 45 month follow up, patients with all parameters outside the target ranges showed the highest incidence of cardiovascular events and all cause deaths (16.6 and 29.2 per 1000 person years, respectively). The relative risks of cardiovascular events and all cause deaths were analyzed by multivariate Cox regression models. The hazard ratio (HR) for cardiovascular events was significantly lower for patients who achieved serum Ca and P objectives compared with others (HR: 2.12; 95% Cl: 1.04 4.34; P < 0.05), and similar differences were observed for all cause deaths (HR: 3.10; 95% Cl: 1.13 8.53; P < 0.05). However, the relationship between iPTH levels and each of the endpoints was less pronounced. The results of this study provide support for the JSDT guidelines, which give priority to the control of serum Ca and P levels over the control of parathyroid function.

AB Introduction: The deleterious effects of letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, used in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women, on bone are well documented and represent a major drawback to its clinical use. Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator and a clinically approved anti osteoporotic drug, has been recently demonstrated to be efficacious in women with breast cancer. The present study evaluated the effects of preventive and curative treatment with raloxifene on letrozole induced alterations of bone microarchitecture and turnover markers in a chemically induced menopause model in mice.
   Method: Swiss strain albino female mice were made menopausal by inducing ovotoxicity using vinyl cyclohexene di epoxide (VCD, 160 mg/kg for 15 days followed by 30 days drug free period) confirmed by ovarian histology and serum estradiol levels. Effects on femoral and lumbar bones were evaluated by micro CT determination of bone volume, trabecular number, separation, thickness, connective density and trabecular pattern factor and bone turnover markers including ALP, TRAP5b, hydroxyproline and RANKL. In addition to these, markers of Wnt signaling (sclerostin and dickkopf 1) were also evaluated. To rule out the involvement of pharmacokinetic interaction, plasma levels of letrozole and raloxifene were measured following drugs alone and in combination.
   Results: Though bone loss was observed in VCD treated mice (as indicated by micro CT measurements), it was further enhanced with letrozole administration (1 mg/1<g) for one month particularly in epiphysis of femoral bones. Raloxifene (15 mg/kg), whether administered concurrently or post letrozole was able to revert the structural alterations and changes in turnover markers caused by letrozole to varying degrees (p < 0.01 or p < 0.001). Further, estrogen deficiency following letrozole treatment in ovotoxic mice was associated with significant increase in sclerostin and dickkopf 1 in both lumbar and femur bones (p < 0.001) which was attenuated with preventive and curative treatment with raloxifene (p < 0.05). The plasma levels of letrozole remained unaffected by raloxifene administration and vice versa.
   Conclusions: Our study indicates the potential of raloxifene in preventing and attenuating letrozoleinduced bone loss. Further, these effects were found to be independent of a pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The genetic risk factors for etoposide induced leukemia with MLL translocations remain largely unknown. To identify genetic risk factors for and novel characteristics of secondary leukemia, we profiled 116 204 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) in germline and paired leukemic cell DNA from 13 secondary leukemia/myelodysplasia cases and germline DNA from 13 matched and 156 unmatched controls, all with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with etoposide. We analyzed global gene expression from a partially overlapping cohort. No single locus was altered in most cases. We discovered 81 regions of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in leukemic blasts and 309 SNPs whose allele frequencies differed in cases vs controls. Candidate genes were prioritized on the basis of genes whose SNPs or expression differentiated cases from controls or showed LOH or copy number change in germline vs paired blast DNA from the13 cases. Three biological pathways were altered: adhesion, Wnt signaling and regulation of actin. Validation experiments using a genome scan for etoposide induced leukemogenic MLL chimeric fusions in 15 HapMap cell lines also implicated genes involved in adhesion, a process linked to de novo leukemogenesis. Independent clinical epidemiologic and in vitro genome wide approaches converged to identify novel pathways that may contribute to therapyinduced leukemia.

AB Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of specific inhibition of MMP 13 on inflammation and inflammatory bone resorption in a murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced periodontitis. Materials and methods Periodontitis was induced in mice by micro injections of LPS into the gingival tissues adjacent to the palatal surfaces of maxillary molars twice a week for 15 days. Matrix metalloproteinase 13 (Mmp 13) shRNA or a specific biochemical inhibitor were also injected into the same sites in alternating days with the LPS injections. Efficacy of shRNA mediated silencing of Mmp 13 was verified by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunoblot. Bone resorption was assessed by microcomputed tomography (uCT). Histological sections stained with hematoxylin/eosin (H/E) were used in the stereometric analysis of the inflammatory infiltrate. Gingival tissues were used to evaluate expression of Mmp 13, Il 6, Tnf alpha, Ptgs2, and Rankl (qPCR). Protein levels of TGF beta and IL 10 in the tissues were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) or by MMP 13 and p38 immunoblot. Results Silencing Mmp 13 expression reduced bone resorption significantly. Expression of Mmp 13, Il 6, and Tnf alpha, as well as the protein levels of IL 6 and TNF alpha, was reduced in the animals treated with adenovirus delivered shRNA; however, these effects were not associated with modulation of p38 MAPK signaling. Interestingly, inhibition Mmp 13 did not affect the severity of inflammatory infiltrate. Conclusions Site specific inhibition of MMP 13 reduced bone resorption and production of inflammatory mediators associated with periodontal disease.

TI Retrovirally mediated genetic correction of mesenchymal stem cells from

AB Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPSII) is an X linked metabolic storage disorder due to the deficiency of iduronate 2 sulphatase (IDS) and accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Clinically it presents as a multi system disorder with developmental delay, bone and joint disease and in the severe forms progressive mental retardation. At present little therapeutic options are available. Bone marrow transplantation is no longer recommended due to the severe side effects and lack of proven efficacy in correcting central nervous system and bone disease. Enzyme replacement therapy is under assessment and it requires weekly, expensive administration for the lifespan of the individual. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are bone marrow derived cells capable of differentiation into tissue such as bone and have been shown to contribute to bone repair. They are amenable to gene manipulation and therefore provide an excellent target for the correction of MPSII disease, especially with regard to bone disease. In this study we tested whether MSC from MPSII patients (hMSC(MPSII)) could be corrected with a retroviral vector expressing the IDS gene. Following transduction hMSC(MPSII) maintained the capacity to differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes and showed levels of IDS enzyme over 10 fold higher than those detected in MSC from healthy donors. This led to normalization of GAGs storage in hMSC(MPSII). Such transduced cells were able to cross correct MPSII fibroblasts by uptake of the IDS enzyme via the mannose 6 phosphate receptor. This study suggests that correction of autologous hMSC(MPSII) by retroviral gene transfer is effective and may be amenable for the improvement of the skeletal features of the disease.

AB Bone is the most common metastatic site for breast cancer. Estrogen related receptor alpha (ERR alpha) has been implicated in cancer cell invasiveness. Here, we established that ERR alpha promotes spontaneous metastatic dissemination of breast cancer cells from primary mammary tumors to the skeleton. We carried out cohort studies, pharmacological inhibition, gain of function analyses in vivo and cellular and molecular studies in vitro to identify new biomarkers in breast cancer metastases. Meta analysis of human primary breast tumors revealed that high ERR alpha expression levels were associated with bone but not lung metastases. ERR alpha expression was also detected in circulating tumor cells from metastatic breast cancer patients. ERR alpha overexpression in murine 4T1 breast cancer cells promoted spontaneous bone micro metastases formation when tumor cells were inoculated orthotopically, whereas lung metastases occurred irrespective of ERR alpha expression level. In vivo, Rank was identified as a target for ERR alpha. That was confirmed in vitro in Rankl stimulated tumor cell invasion, in mTOR/pS6K phosphorylation, by transactivation assay, ChIP and bioinformatics analyses. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of ERR alpha reduced primary tumor growth, bone micro metastases formation and Rank expression in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptomic studies and meta analysis confirmed a positive association between metastases and ERR alpha/RANK in breast cancer patients and also revealed a positive correlation between ERR alpha and BRCA1(mut) carriers. Taken together, our results reveal a novel ERR alpha/RANK axis by which ERR alpha in primary breast cancer promotes early dissemination of cancer cells to bone. These findings suggest that ERR alpha may be a useful therapeutic target to prevent bone metastases.

AB Background: Bone metastases (BMs) are frequently present in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and cause significant morbidity.
   Objective: The purpose of this analysis was to assess the impact of BMs and bisphosphonate therapy (BT) on outcomes in mRCC.
   Design, setting, and participants: We conducted a pooled analysis of patients with mRCC treated from 2003 to 2011 in phase 2 and 3 trials.
   Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Statistical analyses were performed using Cox regression and the Kaplan Meier method.
   Results and limitations: We identified 2749 patients treated with sunitinib (n = 1059), sorafenib (n = 355), axitinib (n = 359), temsirolimus (n = 208), temsirolimus plus interferon alpha (IFN alpha) (n = 208), or IFN alpha (n = 560), with 28% (n = 781) having BMs. A total of 285 patients (10.4%) received BT. The presence of BMs in patients was associated with shorter overall survival (OS) when compared with patients without BMs (13.2 vs 20.2 mo, respectively; p < 0.0001) and shorter progression free survival (PFS) (5.1 vs 6.7 mo, respectively; p < 0.0008). When stratified by risk groups, the presence of BMs was associated with shorter OS in all risk groups. The use of BT in patients with BMs was not associated with improved OS compared with patientswho did not receive BT (13.3 vs 13.1 mo, respectively; p = 0.3801) or improved PFS (5.1 vs 4.9 mo, respectively; p = 0.1785). Bisphosphonate users with BMs did not have a decreased rate of skeletal related events (SREs) compared with nonusers (8.6% vs 5.8%, respectively; p = 0.191). In addition, BT was associated with increased rates of hypocalcemia, renal insufficiency, and osteonecrosis of the jaw (p < 0.0001). Data were analyzed retrospectively.
   Conclusions: We confirm that the presence of BMs is associated with shorter survival in mRCC. BT did not affect survival or SRE prevention and was associated with increased toxicity.
   Patient summary: In this analysis, we demonstrate that bone metastases are associated with shorter survival in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. In addition, we call into question the utility of bisphosphonate therapy in this population. (C) 2014 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A novel loss of function mutation in Npr2 clarifies primary role

AB We discovered a new spontaneous mutant allele of Npr2 named peewee (pwe) that exhibits severe disproportionate dwarfism and female infertility. The pwe phenotype is caused by a four base pair deletion in exon 3 that generates a premature stop codon at codon 313 (L313X). The Npr2(pwe/pwe) mouse is a model for the human skeletal dysplasia acromesomelic dysplasia, Maroteaux type (AMDM). We conducted a thorough analysis of the female reproductive tract and report that the primary cause of Npr2(pwe/pwe) female infertility is premature oocyte meiotic resumption, while the pituitary and uterus appear to be normal. Npr2 is expressed in chondrocytes and osteoblasts. We determined that the loss of Npr2 causes a reduction in the hypertrophic and proliferative zones of the growth plate, but mineralization of skeletal elements is normal. Mutant tibiae have increased levels of the activated form of ERK1/2, consistent with the idea that natriuretic peptide receptor type 2 (NPR2) signaling inhibits the activation of the MEK/ERK mitogen activated protein kinase pathway. Treatment of fetal tibiae explants with mitogen activated protein kinase 1 and 2 inhibitors U0126 and PD325901 rescues the Npr2(pwe/pwe) growth defect, providing a promising foundation for skeletal dysplasia therapeutics.

AB ObjectivesAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease that mainly affects the sacroiliac joint and spine. However, the real mechanisms of immune cells acting on syndesmophyte formation in AS are not well identified. We aimed to find the key AS associated cytokine and assess its pathogenic role in AS.MethodsA protein array with 1000 cytokines was performed in five AS patients with the first diagnosis and five age  and gender matched healthy controls to discover the differentially expressed cytokines. The candidate differentially expressed cytokines were further quantified by multiplex protein quantitation (3 AS associated cytokines and 3 PDGF pathway cytokines) and ELISA (PDGFB) in independent samples (a total of 140 AS patients vs 140 healthy controls). The effects of PDGFB, the candidate cytokine, were examined by using adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) and human fetal osteoblast cell line (hFOB1.19) as in vitro mesenchymal cell and preosteoblast models, respectively. Furthermore, whole transcriptome sequencing and enrichment of phosphorylated peptides were performed by using cell models to explore the underlying mechanisms of PDGFB. The xCELLigence system was applied to examine the proliferation, chemotaxis, and migration abilities of PDGFB stimulated or PDGFB unstimulated cells.ResultsThe PDGF pathway was observed to have abnormal expression in the protein array, and PDGFB expression was further found to be up regulated in 140 Chinese AS patients. Importantly, PDGFB expression was significantly correlated with BASFI (Pearson coefficient/p value = 0.62/6.70E   8) and with the variance of the mSASSS score (mSASSS 2 years   baseline, Pearson coefficient/p value = 0.76/8.75E   10). In AS patients, preosteoclasts secreted more PDGFB than the healthy controls (p value = 1.16E   2), which could promote ADSCs osteogenesis and enhance collagen synthesis (COLI and COLIII) of osteoblasts (hFOB 1.19). In addition, PDGFB promoted the proliferation, chemotaxis, and migration of ADSCs. Mechanismly, in ADSCs, PDGFB stimulated ERK phosphorylation by upregulating GRB2 expression and then increased the expression of RUNX2 to promote osteoblastogenesis of ADSCs.ConclusionPDGFB stimulates the GRB2/ERK/RUNX2 pathway in ADSCs, promotes osteoblastogenesis of ADSCs, and enhances the extracellular matrix of osteoblasts, which may contribute to pathological bone formation in AS.

AB Since many complex physiological processes are controlled by multiple biomolecules, comprehensive regulation of bone tissue regeneration may be more effectively achieved by administering more than one type of biofactor. Thus, we propose a novel bone tissue engineering scaffold incorporating a multiple peptide based drug delivery vehicle for accelerated bone regeneration. Pore closed poly(lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres with a surface structure of multilayer polyelectrolytes ((Ha Cs) 2 Hep BMP 2 Hep( Cs Ha) 2) were prepared as multi barrier microcarriers for osteogenic growth peptide (OGP). In addition, BMP 2 loading was achieved via a pore closing process and layer by layer (LbL) assembly technique, followed by immobilization on the surface of a highly interconnected porous hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffold. On the basis of such a construction, sequential delivery of OGP and BMP 2 occurred in a coordinated manner through an orchestrated sequence of spatial changes, targeting different bone healing stages. The in vitro studies showed that OGP release was minimal (<11.7%) in the first 15 d but accelerated remarkably thereafter, while at least 56.3% of BMP 2 payload was released at this time and subsequent release was only marginal. In addition, scaffolds carrying dual biofactor exhibited a stronger ability to induce bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) differentiation toward osteoblasts than those incorporating OGP or BMP 2 alone and factor free scaffolds in terms of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteogenic gene and protein (Runx2, COL I, and OCN) expression. The results of in vitro cell culturing demonstrated the roles of BMP 2 in osteogenic differentiation early as well as the effect of OGP on accelerated proliferation and maturation of osteoblast precursors at a later stage. Further in vivo osteogenesis studies also revealed that the dual biofactor loaded scaffold manifested the best repair efficacy due to a potential synergistic effect of BMP 2 and OGP. Collectively, our findings suggested that such a dual delivery system may provide a therapeutic strategy sequentially targeting multiple events or mechanisms during bone healing and was proved to be a promising therapeutic scaffold for future use in bone tissue regeneration.

AB Adenosine receptors (ARs) have an important role in the regulation of inflammation and their activation is involved in the inhibition of pro inflammatory cytokine release. The effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) on inflammation have been reported and we have demonstrated that PEMFs increased A(2A) and A(3)AR density and functionality in different cell lines. Chondrocytes and osteoblasts are two key cell types in the skeletal system that play important role in cartilage and bone metabolism representing an interesting target to study the effect of PEMFs. The primary aim of the present study was to evaluate if PEMF exposure potentiated the anti inflammatory effect of A(2A) and/or A(3)ARs in T/C 28a2 chondrocytes and hFOB 1.19 osteoblasts. Immunofluorescence, mRNA analysis and saturation binding assays revealed that PEMF exposure up regulated A(2A) and A(3)AR expression. A(2A) and A(3)ARs were able to modulate cAMP production and cell proliferation. The activation of A(2A) and A3ARs resulted in the decrease of some of the most relevant pro inflammatory cytokine release such as interleukin (IL) 6 and IL 8, following the treatment with IL 1 beta as an inflammatory stimuli. In human chondrocyte and osteoblast cell lines, the inhibitory effect of A(2A) and A(3)AR stimulation on the release of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE(2)), an important lipid inflammatory mediator, was observed. In addition, in T/C 28a2 cells, the activation of A(2A) or A(3)ARs elicited an inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion. In hFOB 1.19 osteoblasts, PEMF exposure determined an increase of osteoprotegerin (OPG) production. The effect of the A(2A) or A(3)AR agonists in the examined cells was enhanced in the presence of PEMFs and completely blocked by using well known selective antagonists. These results demonstrated that PEMF exposure significantly increase the anti inflammatory effect of A(2A) or A(3)ARs suggesting their potential therapeutic use in the therapy of inflammatory bone and joint disorders.

AB We previously developed a load adaptive bone modelling and remodelling simulation model that can predict changes in the bone micro architecture as a result of changes in mechanical loading or cell activity. In combination with a novel algorithm to estimate loading conditions, this offers the possibility for patient specific predictions of bone modelling and remodelling. Based on such models, the underlying mechanisms of bone diseases and/or the effects of certain drugs and their influence on the bone micro architecture can be investigated. In the present study we test the ability of this approach to predict changes in bone micro architecture during hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT), as an illustrative example. We hypothesize that, apart from reducing bone turnover, HypoPT must also lead to increased osteocyte mechanosensitivity in order to explain the changes in bone mass seen in patients. Healthy human iliac crest biopsies were used as the starting point for the simulations that mimic HypoPT conditions and the resultant micro architectures were compared to age matched clinical HypoPT biopsies. Simulation results were in good agreement with the clinical data when osteocyte mechanosensitivity was increased by 40%. In conclusion, the results confirm our hypothesis, and also demonstrate that patient specific bone modelling and remodelling simulations are feasible. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction Anorexia nervosa (AN) increases the risk of impaired bone health, low areal bone mineral density (aBMD), and subsequent fractures. This prospective study investigated the long term effects of bone and mineral metabolism on bone and biomarkers in 22 women with AN. Materials and methods Body composition and aBMD were measured by dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral quantitative computed tomography. Total and free 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), C terminal collagen cross links (CTX), osteocalcin, bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), leptin, sclerostin, and oxidized/non oxidized parathyroid hormone (PTH) were analyzed before and after 12 weeks of intensive nutrition therapy and again 3 years later. An age matched comparison group of 17 healthy women was recruited for the 3 year follow up. Results Body mass index (BMI) and fat mass increased from baseline to 3 years in women with AN. Sclerostin decreased during nutrition therapy and further over 3 years, indicating reduced bone loss. CTX was elevated at baseline and after 12 weeks but decreased over 3 years. BALP increased during nutrition therapy and stabilized over 3 years. Free 25OHD was stable during treatment but decreased over 3 years. Non oxidized PTH was stable during treatment but increased over 3 years. Trabecular volumetric BMD in AN patients decreased during the first 12 weeks and over 3 years despite stable BMI and bone biomarkers implying increased BMD. Conclusion Our findings highlight the importance of early detection and organized long term follow up of bone health in young women with a history of AN.

AB Introduction Corticotomy assisted tooth movement is commonly performed in clinics, however, its time limited efficacy and the fear of surgery among patients significantly limit its clinical application. Hence, researchers have investigated non invasive methods to accelerate tooth movement. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying corticotomy assisted tooth movement are not fully understood.Methods Micro CT and TRAP stain were used to tooth movement and bone resorption. Single cell RNA sequencing was used to study the transcriptome heterogeneity of macrophages after corticotomy. Transmission electron microscopy and iron ion detection was used to evaluate ferroptosis and iron metabolism. In addition, we carried out immunohistochemistry, quantitative real time and flow cytometry verify the effect of iron on macrophage polarization.Results Single cell RNA sequencing of digested alveolar bone identified a significant increase in iron metabolism related genes post corticotomy. Macrophages play a central role in this field. Following the dimensionality reduction of macrophages, we revealed a new developmental state via pseudotime analysis post corticotomy. SCENIC analysis revealed that Atf3 is a key transcription factor influencing this new state. We found that Atf3+ macrophages were closely associated with osteoclasts. Moreover, cell chat revealed an increase in cellular communication between Atf3+ macrophages and other cell types after corticotomy.Discussion These findings suggested that Atf3+ macrophages might play a key role in corticotomy accelerated tooth movement, thus providing potential targets for drug development.

AB Developing multifunctional nanostructures that promote bone repair while fighting infection is highly desirable in bone regenerative therapies. Previous efforts have focused on achieving one property or another by altering the chemical makeup of nanostructures or using growth factors or antibiotics. We present nanostructures with several simultaneous functional attributes including positive effects of strontium on bone formation and pre vention of osteoclast differentiation along with incorporation of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) to prevent infection. To form these multifunctional nanostructures, mesoporous calcium silicate (CaMSN) was modified with high levels of strontium. For this, CaMSNs were either partially substituted (20 wt% Ca) or completely replaced with strontium (Sr) to form Sr CaMSN or SrMSN. The mesoporous nature of these bioactive silicate nanostructures rendered a configuration for substantial AMP loading as well as their effective delivery. The physico chemical and structural characterization of synthesized MSNs confirmed the mesoporous nature of the synthesized MSNs and their total surface area, pore size, pore volume and SBF mediated bioactivity remained unaltered with the incorporation of Sr. However, biological evaluation confirmed that synthesized SrMSN upregulated osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells and significantly downregulated osteoclast differentiation. Also, the AMP loaded MSNs prevented formation and growth of methicillin resistant Staphylo coccus aureus (MRSA) biofilms. Thus, high Sr containing AMP loaded SrMSNs may combat MRSA associated infection while promoting bone regeneration. The controlled availability of therapeutic Sr and AMP release as SrMSN degrade enables its potential application in bone tissue regeneration.

AB Background: Recent studies revealed that the hypoglycemic hormone, glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP 1), acted as an important modulator in osteogenesis of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify the specific microRNA (miRNA) using bioinformatics analysis and validate the presence of differentially expressed microRNAs with their target genes after GLP 1 receptor agonist (GLP 1RA) administration involved in osteogenesis of BMSCs. Methods: MiRNAs were extracted from BMSCs after 5 days' treatment and sent for high throughput sequencing for differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs analyses. Then, the expression of the DE miRNAs was verified by the real time RT PCR analyses. Target genes were predicted, and highly enriched GOs and KEGG pathway analysis were conducted using bioinformatics analysis. For the functional study, two of the target genes, SRY (sex determining region Y) box 5 (SOX5) and G protein coupled receptor 84 (GPR84), were identified. Results: A total of 5 miRNAs (miRNA 509 5p, miRNA 547 3p, miRNA 201 3p, miRNA 201 5p, and miRNA novel 272 mature) were identified and differentially expressed among groups. The expression of miRNA novel 272 mature was decreased during the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, and GLP 1RA further decreased its expression. MiRNA novel 272 mature might interact with its target mRNAs to enhance osteogenesis. The lower expression of miRNA novel 272mature led to an increase in SOX5 and a decrease in GPR84 mRNA expression, respectively. Conclusion: Taken together, these results provide further insights to the pharmacological properties of GLP 1RA and expand our knowledge on the role of miRNAs mRNAs regulation network in BMSCs' differentiation.

AB Objective. The aim of this study was to report cases of medication related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ) associated with targeted therapy (TT) with or without concomitant antiresorptive treatment, among the Copenhagen ONJ cohort, which includes all consecutive cases of MRONJ seen in Copenhagen.
   Study Design. We retrospectively studied the treatment of 204 consecutive patients with MRONJ, seen between January 2010 and May 2016, to identify those associated with TT.
   Results. We detected 7 cases of MRONJ associated with TT (3.4%). Four patients received TT only, whereas 3 were concomitantly treated with bisphosphonates (n = 3) and/or denosumab (n = 3). The TT regimens included sunitinib (Sutent) (n = 1), everolimus (Afinitor) (n = 1), erlotinib (Tarceva) (n = 1), bevacizumab (Avastin) (n = 3), dasatinib (Sprycel) (n = 1) and imatinib (Glivec) (n = 1). The MRONJ stage included stages 1 and 2, and mean score on the visual analogue scale for pain in the jaw was 4.0.
   Conclusions. Health care providers should be aware of the possibility of MRONJ associated with the TT agents sunitinib, everolimus, and dasatinib and uncommon cancer types, including renal cell carcinoma, non small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma, and leukemia, where MRONJ may also occur.

AB Despite efforts to achieve tissue selectivity, the majority of systemically administered drug delivery systems (DDSs) are cleared by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) before reaching target tissues regardless of disease or injury pathology. Previously, we showed that while tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) binding peptide (TBP) targeted polymeric nanoparticles (TBP NP) delivering a bone regenerative Wnt agonist improved NP fracture accumulation and expedited healing compared with controls, there was also significant MPS accumulation. Here we show that TBP NPs are taken up by liver, spleen, lung, and bone marrow macrophages (M phi), with 76 +/  4%, 49 +/  11%, 27 +/  9%, and 92 +/  5% of tissue specific M phi positive for NP, respectively. Clodronate liposomes (CLO) significantly depleted liver and spleen M phi, resulting in 1.8 fold and 3 fold lower liver and spleen and 1.3 fold and 1.6 fold greater fracture and naive femur accumulation of TBP NP. Interestingly, depletion and saturation of MPS using 10 fold greater TBP NP doses also resulted in significantly higher TBP NP accumulation at lungs and kidneys, potentially through compensatory clearance mechanisms. The higher NP dose resulted in greater TBP NP accumulation at naive bone tissue; however, other MPS tissues (i.e., heart and lungs) exhibited greater TBP NP accumulation, suggesting uptake by other cell types. Most importantly, neither M phi depletion nor saturation strategies improved fracture site selectivity of TBP NPs, possibly due to a reduction of M phi derived osteoclasts, which deposit the TRAP epitope. Altogether, these data support that MPS mediated clearance is a key obstacle in robust and selective fracture accumulation for systemically administered bone targeted DDS and motivates the development of more sophisticated approaches to further improve fracture selectivity of DDS.

AB Purpose: To investigate the effect and mechanism of action of Ermiao san (EMS), a traditional Chinese herbal formula, on inflammation development and production of inflammatory mediators in adjuvant induced arthritis (AIA).
   Methods: AIA was induced by injection of 0.1 ml Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA, 10 mg/ml) in the left hind footpad of the rats. AIA rats were intragastricly treated with 0.5, 1, 2 g/kg EMS or 0.1 g/kg methotrexate from day 7 to 28 after FCA challenge. Foot volume and histological score were measured. Osteoclast number was calculated by tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining assay. Levels of prostaglandin (PG) E2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)  alpha and interleukin (IL) 1 beta in serum were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) while the level of nitric oxide (NO) in serum was analyzed by Griess reaction method.
   Results: Foot volume, histological score, osteoclast number and serum levels of TNF alpha, IL 1 beta, PGE2 and NO were all increased in AIA group rats on day 28 after FCA challenge (all p < 0.01) compared with control. EMS (1 and 2 g/kg) significantly decreased the foot volume of AIA rats by 10 % (p < 0.05) and 19 % (p < 0.01), respectively, compared with AIA group. Furthermore, 1 and 2 g/kg EMS significantly reduced histological score by about 28 % (p < 0.05) and 46 % (p < 0.01), respectively, as well as osteoclast number by 12 % (p < 0.05) and 15 % (p < 0.05), respectively, compared with AIA group. In addition, 1 and 2 g/kg EMS significantly decreased the serum levels of TNF alpha about 23 % (p < 0.05) and 43 % (p < 0.01), IL 1 beta by 15 % (p < 0.05) and 26 % (p < 0.01), NO 13 % (p < 0.05) and 26 % (p < 0.01) as well as PGE2 by 11 % (p < 0.05) and 15 % (p < 0.01), respectively, compared with AIA group.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that EMS probably alleviates arthritis development and joint destruction by decreasing the production of inflammatory mediators in AIA rats.

AB Background: Published literatures report controversial results about the effect of combined treatment with alendronate and alfacalcidol for the prevention of fractures in osteoporosis patients. Methods: Seven common databases were searched for related randomized controlled trials published up to April, 2015. Bayesian random effects network meta analysis was used to assess the pairwise odds ratios (OR), 95% credible intervals (CI). Results: Thirteen randomized controlled trials were identified (3710 patients). The network meta analysis results indicated that combining treatment with alendronate and alfacalcidol was significantly better to prevent bone fractures in osteoporosis patients than alendronate (OR= 0.53, 95% CI: 0.19 0.95) and alfacalcidol (OR= 0.25, 95% CI: 0.08 0.49). In addition, there was no significant difference for adverse events among the three therapeutic regimen. Conclusions: Combined treatment with alendronate and alfacalcidol was more active than the monotherapies in preventing bone fractures in osteoporosis patients. Large scale randomized, controlled trials are recommended to confirm the result.

AB Single and double amino bisphosphonates were synthesized and tested for coordination capabilities towards Ca2+, Mg2+, Cu2+ and Ni2+ metal ions by means of potentiometry, UV vis spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (ESI MS) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), as well as for cytotoxic activity by MTT [(3 (4,5 dimethylthiazol  2 yl) 2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide)] assay. Half minimal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined with respect to two cell lines (human melanoma A375 and human colorectal adenocarcinoma HT29). Basing the structure of compounds on a cyclohexane ring allowed for a slight reduction of high hydrophilic character of the studied bisphosphonates (BPs). The ligands efficiently bind the examined metal ions forming complex equilibria with diversified stoichiometry of equimolar, polynuclear species and biscomplexes. Both ligands as well as their Ca2+ and Mg2+ complexes show selective antiproliferative activity toward the studied cancer cell lines. Given the thermodynamic and biological data, it can be assumed that ligands are good candidates for linking compounds that may be used in the design of new drug delivery systems. In this approach, one bisphosphonate moiety acts as a bone targeting molecule, while another molecule can be readily attached to the second donor function (primary amine or bisphosphonate).

AB Ursolic acid (UA), a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpene acid found in many medicinal herbs and edible plants, triggers apoptosis in several tumor cell lines but not in human bone cancer cells. Most recently, we have demonstrated that UA exposure reduces the viability of human osteosarcoma MG 63 cells through enhanced oxidative stress and apoptosis. Interestingly, an inhibitor of osteoclast mediated bone resorption, zoledronic acid (ZOL), also a third generation nitrogen containing bisphosphonate, is effective in the treatment of bone metastases in patients with various solid tumors. In this present study, we found that UA combined with ZOL to significantly suppress cell viability, colony formation, and induce apoptosis in two lines of human osteosarcoma cells. The pre treatment of the antioxidant had reversed the oxidative stress and cell viability inhibition in the combined treatment, indicating that oxidative stress is important in the combined anti tumor effects. Moreover, we demonstrated that ZOL combined with UA significantly induced autophagy and co administration of autophagy inhibitor reduces the growth inhibitory effect of combined treatment. Collectively, these data shed light on the pathways involved in the combined effects of ZOL and UA that might serve as a potential therapy against osteosarcoma.

AB Bone defect repair remains a critical challenge in current orthopedic clinical practice, as the available therapeutic strategies only offer suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, bone tissue engineering (BTE) approaches, involving the development of biomimetic implantable scaffolds combined with osteoprogenitor cells and native like physical stimuli, are gaining widespread interest. Electrical stimulation (ES) based therapies have been found to actively promote bone growth and osteogenesis in both in vivo and in vitro settings. Thus, the combination of electroactive scaffolds comprising conductive biomaterials and ES holds significant promise in improving the effectiveness of BTE for clinical applications. The aim of this study was to develop electroconductive polyacrylonitrile/poly(3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PAN/PEDOT:PSS) nanofibers via electrospinning, which are capable of emulating the native tissue's fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM) and providing a platform for the delivery of exogenous ES. The resulting nanofibers were successfully functionalized with apatite like structures to mimic the inorganic phase of the bone ECM. The conductive electrospun scaffolds presented nanoscale fiber diameters akin to those of collagen fibrils and displayed bone like conductivity. PEDOT:PSS incorporation was shown to significantly promote scaffold mineralization in vitro. The mineralized electroconductive nanofibers demonstrated improved biological performance as observed by the significantly enhanced proliferation of both human osteoblast like MG 63 cells and human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hBM MSCs). Moreover, mineralized PAN/PEDOT:PSS nanofibers up regulated bone marker genes expression levels of hBM MSCs undergoing osteogenic differentiation, highlighting their potential as electroactive biomimetic BTE scaffolds for innovative bone defect repair strategies.

AB Background. Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) is an aggressive primary osteolytic tumor. GCTB often involves the epiphysis, usually causing substantial pain and functional disability. Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against receptor activator of nuclear factor. kappa beta ligand (RANKL), is an effective treatment option for patients with advanced GCTB. This analysis of data from an ongoing, open label study describes denosumab's effects on pain and analgesic use in patients with GCTB.
   Material and methods. Patients with unresectable disease (e. g. sacral or spinal GCTB, or multiple lesions including pulmonary metastases) were enrolled into Cohort 1 (N = 170), and patients with resectable disease whose planned surgery was associated with severe morbidity (e. g. joint resection, limb amputation, or hemipelvectomy) were enrolled into Cohort 2 (N = 101). Patients received denosumab (120 mg) subcutaneously every four weeks, with additional doses on study days 8 and 15. Patients assessed worst pain severity with the Brief Pain Inventory   Short Form (BPI SF) at baseline, at each visit for the first six months, and every three months thereafter.
   Results. Clinically relevant pain improvement was reported by 29% of patients in Cohort 1 and 35% in Cohort 2 during week 1 and by >= 50% of patients in each cohort at each study visit from months 2 30. Median time to clinically relevant improvement was 30 (95% CI 16, 57) days in Cohort 1 and 15 (95% CI 15, 29) days in Cohort 2. Results in patients with moderate/severe pain at baseline were similar. Fewer than 30% of patients in Cohort 1 and 10% in Cohort 2 experienced clinically relevant pain worsening at any visit through 27 months. Most patients had no/low analgesic use during the study.
   Conclusion. Most patients treated with denosumab experienced clinically relevant decreases in pain within two months.

AB We aimed to identify specific circular RNAs (circRNAs) involved in bone repair of trauma induced osteonecrosis of femoral head (TIONFH) and to explore the potential mechanism. CircRNA sequencing on the blood sample collected from patients with and without TIONFH was performed to select cirRNAs that were significantly differentially expressed, followed by qRT PCR confirmation. Furthermore, the functions of one selected circRNA and the potential mechanisms in bone repair of TIONFH were validated based on the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and osteoclast like cells (OLCs) through CCK 8, flow cytometry, transwell assay, luciferase reporter assay, and western blot. A total of 234 upregulated and 148 downregulated differentially expressed circRNAs were identified, and qRT PCR showed that circRNA_25487 was significantly upregulated in the peripheral blood of TIONFH patients. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed the binding effect between miR 134 3p and circRNA_25487. CircRNA_25487 suppression and miR 134 3p overexpression could promote cell proliferation and in vasion while inhibited apoptosis of BMSCs and OLCs. miR 134 3p could target p21. CircRNA_25487 inhibited bone repair in TIONFH by sponging miR 134 3p to upregulate the expression of p21. (c) 2021, The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine.

AB The present study was carried out to obtain an experimental model of vitamin D (vit D) insufficiency and established osteopenia (experiment 1) to then investigate whether vit D status, i.e. normal or insufficient, interferes with bone mass recovery resulting from bisphosphonate therapy (experiment 2). Rats (n = 40) underwent OVX (n = 32) or a sham operation (n = 8). The first 15 days post surgery, all groups were kept under fluorescent tube lighting and fed a diet containing 200 IU% vit D (+D). They were then assigned during an additional 45 days to receive either +D or a diet lacking vit D ( D) and kept under 12 h light/dark cycles using fluorescent or red lighting. Serum 25HOD was significantly lower in  D rats (P < 0.0001). The type of lighting did not induce differences in 25OHD, calcium (sCa), phosphorus (sP), bone alkaline phosphatase (b AL), CTX, bone density or histology. No osteoid was observed in undecalcified bone sections. Experiment 2 (105 days): rats were fed either +D or  D according to experiment 1 and were treated with either placebo or 16 mu g olpadronate (OPD)/100 g rat/week during the last 45 days. Whereas 25HOD was significantly lower (P < 0.0001) in  D/OPD than in +D/OPD rats, no significant differences in sCa, sP, b AL or CTX were observed. OPD prevented the loss of lumbar spine (LS) and proximal tibia (PT) BMD and the decrease in bone volume (BV/TV) (P < 0.05) and in the number of trabeculae observed in untreated rats. However, +D/OPD animals presented significantly higher values of LS BMD, PT BMD and BV/TV than  D/OPD rats (P < 0.05). No osteoid was observed in undecalcified sections of bone. In summary, this is the first experimental study to provide evidence that differences in vit D status may affect the anticatabolic response to bisphosphonate treatment. However, the molecular mechanism through which vit D insufficiency reduces the effect of the aminobisphosphonate remains to be defined. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Yi Shen Juan Bi Pill (YSJB), a traditional Chinese compound herbal drug, has been used as an anti rheumatic drug in clinical practice. Cartilage and bone destruction of inflamed joints is the hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our previous study suggested that YSJB had a protective effect on joint damage in collagen induced (CIA) rats. However, the role and the mechanism of YSJB in inflammation induced bone loss are unavailable. The current study aimed to further evaluate the effect of YSJB on the joint destruction and the systemic bone loss, and to clarify the potential mechanism. CIA model was generated by using collagen II and incomplete Freund's adjuvant in Sprague Dawley rats. After 4 weeks treatment, arthritic index, tissue pathology, micro computed tomography scanning (mu CT), and bone mineral density (BMD) analysis were performed. YSJB decreased arthritic scores and bone destruction; improved the BMD of lumbar vertebrae and bone volume fraction of inflamed joints. Moreover, YSJB significantly decreased the production of serum bone resorption markers, including Tartrate Resistant Acid Phosphatase (TRACP), N terminal telopeptide of type I collagen and C terminal telopeptide of type I collagen. Meanwhile, it increased the level of serum bone formation marker type I collagen N terminal propeptide. These results revealed that YSJB ameliorated bone destruction and reduced bone loss induced by arthritis. We have previously showed that Tregs inhibited osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption in vitro. Furthermore, others suggested that abnormality of Th1, Th17 may contribute to bone destruction. Here, we showed YSJB significantly up regulated the percentage of Tregs, while also down regulated the percentage of Th1 and Th17 cells. Our findings provide the evidence that YSJB ameliorates the severity of disease and joint degradation, and reduces systemic bone loss induced by arthritis. We propose YSJB modulates the balance of T cell phenotype, which affects the activation and differentiation of osteoclasts.

AB ObjectivesIcariin, a prenylated flavonol glycoside isolated from traditional Chinese medicinal herb of the genus Epimedium, has been demonstrated to be a potential alternative therapy for osteoporosis, and its action mechanism so far has been mainly attributed to its phytoestrogenic property. As blood supply to bone is considerably reduced with ageing and by the menopause, we hypothesized that icariin treatment would reduce bone loss by preventing ischaemia induced hypoxic damages to bone.
   Materials and methodsTo investigate effects of icariin treatment on cultured rat calvarial osteoblasts exposed to hypoxic conditions (2% oxygen).
   ResultsCompared to normoxic control, cell viability decreased with time to 50% by 48h in the hypoxic group, and icariin attenuated the reduction, dose dependently, with 10( 6) and 10( 5)m concentrations showing significant protective effects. Icariin also inhibited increase of lactate dehydrogenase activity in culture media. Measurements on oxidative stress, cell cycling and cell survival indicated that icariin protected osteoblasts by reducing production of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde, increasing superoxide dismutase activity, arresting the cell cycle and inhibiting apoptosis. Icariin also preserved osteogenic differentiation potential of the hypoxic cells in a dose dependent manner, compared to the hypoxia alone group, as revealed by increased levels of RUNX 2, OSX and BMP 2 gene expression, alkaline phosphatase activity, and formation of mineralized nodules.
   ConclusionsOur results demonstrated that icariin attenuated oxidative stress and apoptosis and preserved viability and osteogenic potential of osteoblasts exposed to hypoxia in vitro, and suggested that its anti osteoporotic effect may be attributed to its anti hypoxic activity and phytoestrogenic properties.

AB Background: Gram negative bacterial species, such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, contain lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that initiates the innate immune system, resulting in inflammatory alveolar bone loss. LPS activates Toll like receptors on membrane surfaces, stimulating many intracellular signaling cascades, including the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). Activation of p38 signaling mediates inflammatory cytokine expression, contributing toward osteoclastogenesis and bone loss. The aim of this study was to determine whether the novel, orally active p38 MAPK inhibitor SD282 could arrest progression of LPS induced alveolar bone destruction in rats.
   Methods: Three groups of female Sprague Dawley rats received LPS injections to the palatal molar gingiva three times per week for 4 weeks to establish periodontitis. From weeks 5 through 8, two groups received the drug SD282 (N = 14) or 1% polyethylene glycol drug vehicle (N = 14) via oral gavage in addition to LPS injections. The third group continued to receive only LPS injections (N = 8). Microcomputed tomography was used to measure volumetric alveolar bone loss, expressed as bone volume fraction (BVF). Expression of interleukin (IL) 1 and  6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) was assessed by immunohistochemistry, and osteoclasts were enumerated by tartrate resistant acid phosphatase staining.
   Results: By 4 weeks, severe alveolar bone resorption was seen in LPS injected animals. Administration of SD282 significantly blocked additional volumetric bone loss in the LPS only versus LPS + SD282 groups (0.37 +/  0.01 BVF versus 0.43 +/  0.01 BVF; P < 0.01). Significant reductions in ILAP (P < 0.01), TNF a (P < 0.05), and osteoclast formation (P < 0.01) occurred in the presence of SD282.
   Conclusions: An orally active p38 MAPK inhibitor reduced LPS induced inflammatory cytokine expression, osteoclastogenesis, and alveolar bone loss in rats. Within the limits of the current study, SD282 arrested periodontal disease progression, thus highlighting the therapeutic potential of this novel class of inhibitors.

AB Ca2+  signaling of human melanoma is in the focus of intensive research since the identification of the role of WNT signaling in melanomagenesis. Genomic and functional studies pointed to the important role of various Ca2+ channels in melanoma, but these data were contradictory. In the present study we clearly demonstrate, in a number of different ways including microarray analysis, DNA sequencing and immunocytochemistry, that various human melanoma cell lines and melanoma tissues overexpress ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) and express P2X(7) channel proteins as compared to melanocytes. These channels, although retain some of their usual characteristics and pharmacological properties, display unique features in melanoma cells, including a functional interaction between the two molecules. Unlike P2X7, RyR2 does not function as a calcium channel. On the other hand, the P2X7 receptor has an antiapoptotic function in melanoma cells, since ATP activation suppresses induced apoptosis, while knock down of the gene expression significantly enhances that.

AB Shock wave therapy has been increasingly evaluated as a non invasive alternative for the treatment of delayed fracture healing and non unions. Although several clinical studies showed a beneficial effect especially for the hypertrophic type of non union, little is known about the biological mechanism of its osteogenic effect. To identify the molecular background for the positive effect of shock waves on healing of fracture non unions, we have analyzed the changes of the global gene expression in human osteoblasts after exposure to shock waves of different energy flux densities. Human osteoblasts were isolated from five patients at non union sites, treated with 500 impulses of energy flux densities of 0.06 and , and cultured for 96 h. HG U133A microarrays were used for the analysis of the shock wave regulated mRNA transcripts. Differential gene expression was verified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions. We identified 47 transcripts that showed differential expression after and 45 transcripts after energy treatment. Most intriguing was the up regulation of neprilysin, calmegin, osteoglycin, asporin, and interleukin 13 receptor . Eighteen identified genes were previously described to fulfill an important function in bone growth and metabolism. Our study provides the first molecular profile of shock wave induced gene expression changes in human osteoblasts from patients with hypertrophic fracture non unions, and it offers a possible molecular explanation for the positive effects of shock waves in patients ridden with this disease .

AB Objectives: Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are particularly used in patients with bone fractures, but there are limited studies on whether one NSAID is superior to another. In this study, we used histopathological and biochemical parameters to determine whether there are differences between the effects of the administration of clinical doses of dexketoprofen trometamol (DEXT), meloxicam (MEL) and diclofenac sodium (DIC) on the healing of closed fibular fractures and the toxicity of both the liver and kidney.
   Methods: Twenty eight male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups of seven each. Closed diaphyseal fractures were formed in the left fibulas of all of the rats. The NSAIDs dexketoprofen trometamol (DEXT) (Arveles (R)), meloxicam (MEL) (Melox (R)) and diclofenac sodium (DIC) (Voltaren (R)) were intramuscularly administered to Groups I, II, and III, respectively, for a period of 10 days after the fibular fractures were performed. No pharmacological agents were administered to Group IV (Control group). Blood samples were collected from all of the rats after the fractures were performed, and the rats were sacrificed on day 28. The histopathological findings were compared, and the blood samples were evaluated to determine any differences between the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA).
   Results: Our results suggest that DEXT and MEL impair the healing of bone fractures and that DIC does not histopathologically affect the healing process of bone fractures. We also found that DEXT, MEL, and DIC impaired the renal histopathology compared with the control group. However, the liver histopathological analysis showed that DEXT and MEL caused a higher degree of parenchymal necrosis compared with DIC.
   Conclusion: Based on our results, DIC can be considered a relatively safe medication in patients with fractures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Enhancement of CCL2 expression and monocyte migration by CCN1 in

AB Cysteine rich 61 (Cyr61 or CCN1), a secreted protein from the CCN family, is an important proinflammatory cytokine. Migration and infiltration of mononuclear cells to inflammatory sites play a critical role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP 1/CCL2) is the key chemokine that regulates migration and infiltration of monocytes. Here, we examined the role of CCN1 in monocyte migration, and CCL2 expression in osteoblasts. We found higher levels of CCN1 and CCL2 in synovial fluid from RA patients compared with levels from non RA controls. We also found that the CCN1 induced increase in CCL2 expression is mediated by the MAPK signaling pathway and that miR 518a 5p expression was negatively regulated by CCN1 via the MAPK cascade. In contrast, inhibition of CCN1 expression with lentiviral vectors expressing short hairpin RNA ameliorated articular swelling, cartilage erosion, and infiltration of monocytes in the ankle joints of mice with collagen induced arthritis. Our study describes how CCN1 promotes monocyte migration by upregulating CCL2 expression in osteoblasts in RA disease. CCN1 could serve as a potential target for RA treatment.

AB The goal of this investigation was to identify potential risk factors to predict the onset of medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). Through the identification of the multiple variables positively associated to MRONJ, we aim to write a paradigm for integrated MRONJ risk assessment built on the combined analysis of systemic and local risk factors. The characteristics of a cohort of cancer patients treated with zoledronic acid and/or denosumab were investigated; beyond the set of proven risk factors a new potential one, the intake of new molecules for cancer therapy, was addressed. Registered data were included in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis in order to individuate significant independent predictors of MRONJ; a propensity score matching method was performed adjusting by age and sex. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed a significant effect of the parameters number of doses of zoledronic acid and/or denosumab (OR = 1.03; 95% CI = 1.01 1.05; p = 0.008) and chemotherapy (OR = 0.35; 95% CI = 0.17 0.71; p = 0.008). The multiple logistic regression model showed that breast, multiple myeloma, and prostate cancer involved a significantly higher risk compared to lung cancer; a significant effect of the combined variables number of doses of zoledronic acid and/or denosumab (OR = 1.03; 95% CI = 1.01 1.06); p value = 0.03) and exposure to novel molecule treatment (OR = 34.74; 95% CI = 1.39 868.11; p value = 0.03) was observed. The results suggest that a risk assessment paradigm is needed for personalized prevention strategies in the light of patient centered care.</p>

AB Gorham Stout disease (GSD) is a rare bone disorder characterized by aggressive osteolysis associated with lymphatic vessel invasion within bone marrow cavities. The etiology of GSD is not known, and there is no effective therapy or animal model for the disease. Here, we investigated if lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) affect osteoclasts (OCs) to cause a GSD osteolytic phenotype in mice. We examined the effect of a mouse LEC line on osteoclastogenesis in co cultures. LECs significantly increased receptor activator of NF B ligand (RANKL) mediated OC formation and bone resorption. LECs expressed high levels of macrophage colony stimulating factor (M CSF), but not RANKL, interleukin 6 (IL 6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). LEC mediated OC formation and bone resorption were blocked by an M CSF neutralizing antibody or Ki20227, an inhibitor of the M CSF receptor, c Fms. We injected LECs into the tibias of wild type (WT) mice and observed massive osteolysis on X ray and micro CT scans. Histology showed that LEC injected tibias had significant trabecular and cortical bone loss and increased OC numbers. M CSF protein levels were significantly higher in serum and bone marrow plasma of mice given intra tibial LEC injections. Immunofluorescence staining showed extensive replacement of bone and marrow by podoplanin+ LECs. Treatment of LEC injected mice with Ki20227 significantly decreased tibial bone destruction. In addition, lymphatic vessels in a GSD bone sample were stained positively for M CSF. Thus, LECs cause bone destruction in vivo in mice by secreting M CSF, which promotes OC formation and activation. Blocking M CSF signaling may represent a new therapeutic approach for treatment of patients with GSD. Furthermore, tibial injection of LECs is a useful mouse model to study GSD.

AB Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) physiologically regulates both angiogenesis and osteogenesis, but its application in bone tissue engineering led to contradictory outcomes. A poorly understood aspect is how VEGF dose impacts the coordination between these two processes. Taking advantage of a unique and highly tunable platform, here we dissected the effects of VEGF dose over a 1,000 fold range in the context of tissue engineered osteogenic grafts. We found that osteo angiogenic coupling is exquisitely dependent on VEGF dose and that only a tightly defined dose range could stimulate both vascular invasion and osteogenic commitment of progenitors, with significant improvement in bone formation. Further, VEGF dose regulated Notch1 activation and the induction of a specific pro osteogenic endothelial phenotype, independently of the promotion of vascular invasion. Therefore, in a therapeutic perspective, fine tuning of VEGF dose in the signaling microenvironment is key to ensure physiological coupling of accelerated vascular invasion and improved bone formation.

AB Bisphosphonates are drugs that are used to treat osteoporosis that causes the low mineral density of the bones. These drugs can be delivered in several ways, but each method has disadvantages. Materials with high potential as carriers of these drugs are zeolites with divalent ions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of divalent cations (calcium, magnesium, zinc) and drug type (risedronate, zoledronate) on sorption and release of the drug for osteoporosis. It was proved that drug sorption occurs on all zeolites presented in this work. Risedronate sorption was highest in zinc zeolite and lowest in calcium zeolite. In the case of zoledronate, sorption was most effective in magnesium zeolite and the least effective in zinc zeolite. Very large differences in drug release profiles were also observed. Risedronate was released several times longer than zoledronate. The diversity of the results indicates that the examined materials can be used in different types of drug delivery systems. They can be used, for example, intravenously or in the form of implants due to the different release profiles. Furthermore, the proposed carriers also release magnesium and calcium ions which are used in the prevention of osteoporosis, and zinc ions which have antibacterial properties.

AB Primary cancer modulates the bone microenvironment to sow the seeds of dormancy and metastasis in tumor cells, leading to multiple organ metastasis and death. In this study, 3D printing and bone on a chip (BOC) are combined to develop a BOC platform that mimics the pre metastatic niches (PMNs) and facilitates elucidation of the interactions between bone resident cells and metastatic tumor cells under the influence of primary cancer. Photocrosslinkable gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) is used as a 3D culturing hydrogel to encapsulate cells, and circulate tumor culture medium (CM) adjacent to the hydrogel to verify the critical role of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and osteoclasts (RAW264.7s). Three niches: the dormancy niche, the perivascular niche, and the "vicious cycle" niche, are devised to recapitulate bone metastasis in one chip with high cell viability and excellent nutrient exchange. With respect to tumor dormancy and reactivation, the invadopodia formation of A549 lung cancer cells in communication with MSCs and RAW264.7 via the cortactin pathway is researched. As a proof of concept, the functionality and practicality of the platform are demonstrated by analyzing the invadopodia formation and the influence of various cells, and the establishment of the dynamic niches paves the way to understanding PMN formation and related drug discovery.

AB Transplantation of whole bone marrow (BMT) as well as ex vivo expanded mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) leads to striking clinical benefits in children with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI); however, the underlying mechanism of these cell therapies has not been elucidated. Here, we show that non (plastic) adherent bone marrow cells (NABMCs) are more potent osteoprogenitors than MSCs in mice. Translating these findings to the clinic, a T cell depleted marrow mononuclear cell boost (> 99.99% NABMC) given to children with OI who had previously undergone BMT resulted in marked growth acceleration in a subset of patients, unambiguously indicating the therapeutic potential of bone marrow cells for these patients. Then, in a murine model of OI, we demonstrated that as the donor NABMCs differentiate to osteoblasts, they contribute normal collagen to the bone matrix. In contrast, MSCs do not substantially engraft in bone, but secrete a soluble mediator that indirectly stimulates growth, data which provide the underlying mechanism of our prior clinical trial of MSC therapy for children with OI. Collectively, our data indicate that both NABMCs and MSCs constitute effective cell therapy for OI, but exert their clinical impact by different, complementary mechanisms. The study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00187018. (Blood. 2012;120(9):1933 1941)

AB We investigated the effect of tigogenin on adipocytic and osteoblastic differentiation in mouse bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Tigogenin enhanced the proliferation of BMSCs significantly. Tigogenin treatment reduced the adipogenic induction of lipid accumulation, visfatin secretion, and the expressions of peroxisome proliferation activated receptor (PPAR)gamma 2 and adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (ap)2. Moreover, tigogenin had no effect on the mitotic clonal expansion. On the other hand, tigogenin significantly elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and the expressions of Cbfa1, collagen type 1 (COL I) and osteocalcin (OCN), as well as the content of matrix calcium in BMSCs. Further, SB 203580 antagonized the tigogenin promoted osteogenesis. These observations suggested that tigogenin may modulate differentiation of BMSCs to cause a lineage shift away from the adipocytes and toward the osteoblasts, which is at least mediated by inhibition of PPAR gamma and via p38 MAPK pathway, and is a potential drug preventing the development of osteoporosis and the related disorders.

TI IAP antagonists sensitize murine osteosarcoma cells to killing by TNFα

AB Outcomes for patients diagnosed with the bone cancer osteosarcoma have not improved significantly in the last four decades. Only around 60% of patients and about a quarter of those with metastatic disease survive for more than five years. Although DNA damaging chemotherapy drugs can be effective, they can provoke serious or fatal adverse effects including cardiotoxicity and therapy related cancers. Better and safer treatments are therefore needed. We investigated the anti osteosarcoma activity of IAP antagonists (also known as Smac mimetics) using cells from primary and metastatic osteosarcomas that arose spontaneously in mice engineered to lack p53 and Rb expression in osteoblast derived cells. The IAP antagonists SM 164, GDC 0152 and LCL161, which efficiently target XIAP and cIAPs, sensitized cells from most osteosarcomas to killing by low levels of TNF alpha but not TRAIL. RIPK1 expression levels and activity correlated with sensitivity. RIPK3 levels varied considerably between tumors and RIPK3 was not required for IAP antagonism to sensitize osteosarcoma cells to TNF alpha. IAP antagonists, including SM 164, lacked mutagenic activity. These data suggest that drugs targeting XIAP and cIAP1/2 may be effective for osteosarcoma patients whose tumors express abundant RIPK1 and contain high levels of TNF alpha, and would be unlikely to provoke therapy induced cancers in osteosarcoma survivors.

AB Exercise and bisphosphonate therapies increase bone strength by primarily increasing bone formation and reducing resorption, respectively. Based on these different mechanisms of action, it is possible that combined introduction of exercise and bisphosphonate therapies generates greater improvements in bone mass and strength than either intervention alone. The aim of this study was to examine the individual and combined effects of exercise (treadmill running) and bisphosphonate therapy (alendronate [ALM) on bone mass and strength in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Seven month old virgin female rats were randomly assigned to either a sham OVX group (n= 13) or one of four OVX groups: vehicle treated cage control (VEH CON, n= 10); ALNtreated cage control (ALN CON, n = 13); vehicle treated plus treadmill running (VEH RUN, n = 13); and ALN treated plus treadmill running (ALNRUN, n= 13). ALN treated groups received twice weekly ALN (0.015 mg/kg), and exercise groups ran on a motorized treadmill at a 5% incline for 60 min/day, 22 24 m/min, 5 days/week. In vivo measurements included dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) of whole body bone mineral content (BMC), and ex vivo measurements included DXA, micro computed tomography (mu CT), and mechanical testing of the femur and L4 vertebrae. After 14 weeks of intervention, exercise and ALN had additive benefits on whole body and proximal femur BMC, cross sectional area of the L4 vertebrae, and mechanical properties of the mid shaft femur. In comparison, for total and mid shaft femur BMC, L4 vertebrae BMC, and mid shaft femur cortical thickness and area, there were significant exercise and ALN interactions indicating that the two interventions worked in synergy to enhance bone properties. Supporting the contention that ALN and exercise function via distinct mechanisms of action, ALN successfully reduced medullary canal area suggesting it reduced endocortical bone resorption, whereas exercise augmented periosteal perimeter suggesting it stimulated periosteal bone formation. In summary, we found combined treadmill running and ALN to be more beneficial in preventing declines in bone mass and strength following OVX than the introduction of either intervention alone. These data suggest that a comprehensive program of bisphosphonate therapy and weight bearing exercise may be an effective method for preventing and treating osteoporosis in post menopausal women.

AB Introduction: Osteoporotic related fractures remains a significant public health concern, thus imposing substantial burdens on our society. Excessive activation of osteoclastic activity is one of the main contributing factors for osteoporosis  related fractures. While polylactic acid (PLA) is frequently employed as a biodegradable scaffold in tissue engineering, it lacks sufficient biological activity. Microdroplets (MDs) have been explored as an ultrasound  responsive drug delivery method, and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)  derived exosomes have shown therapeutic effects in diverse preclinical investigations. Thus, this study aimed to develop a novel bioactive hybrid PLA scaffold by integrating MDs NFATc1 silencing siRNA to target osteoclast formation and MSCs exosomes (MSC Exo) to influence osteogenic differentiation (MDsNFATc1/PLA Exo). Methods: Human bone marrow  derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSCs) were used for exosome isolation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy were used for exosome and MDs morphological characterization, respectively. The MDs NFATc1/PLA Exo scaffold was fabricated through poly(dopamine) and fibrin gel coating. Biocompatibility was assessed using RAW 264.7 macrophages and hBMSCs. Osteoclast formations were examined via TRAP staining. Osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs and cytokine expression modulation were also investigated. Results: MSC Exo exhibited a cup  shaped structure and effective internalization into cells, while MDs displayed a spherical morphology with a well defined core  shell structure. Following ultrasound stimulation, the internalization study demonstrated efficient delivery of bioactive MDs into recipient cells. Biocompatibility studies indicated no cytotoxicity of MDs NFATc1/PLA Exo scaffolds in RAW 264.7 macrophages and hBMSCs. Both MDs NFATc1/PLA and MDs NFATc1/PLA Exo treatments significantly reduced osteoclast differentiation and formation. In addition, our results further indicated MDs NFATc1/PLA Exo scaffold significantly enhanced osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs and modulated cytokine expression. Discussion: These findings suggest that the bioactive MDs NFATc1/PLA Exo scaffold holds promise as an innovative structure for bone tissue regeneration. By specifically targeting osteoclast formation and promoting osteogenic differentiation, this hybrid scaffold may address key challenges in osteoporosis  related fractures.

AB Bone metastasis is a fatal consequence of breast cancer that occurs when patients fail to respond to conventional therapies and mainly result from a vicious cycle involving dysregulated bone homeostasis and uncontrolled tumor growth. Recent research has underscored the significance of Siglec 15, a membrane protein implicated in immunosuppression and osteoclast generation. Targeting Siglec 15 may disrupt the "vicious cycle" that causes bone metastases in patients with breast cancer. Herein, we explored the efficacy of targeting Siglec 15 in conjunction with photothermal chemotherapy to impede the progression of bone metastatic during breast cancer and repair tumor induced osteolysis. First, we formulated an injectable photothermal bioactive glass (BG) based hydrogel for the local delivery of Siglec 15 shRNA and doxorubicin. The results demonstrated that the hydrogel could kill tumor cells directly through photothermal chemotherapy, provoke intense immune responses and improve the local immunosuppressive microenvironment, which could effectively prevent tumor metastasis and recurrence in a murine model. The combined effect of BGs and Siglec15 shRNA can normalize dysregulated bone homeostasis at the bone metastasis site and significantly reduced bone destruction. Overall, the use of Siglec 15targeting integrated BG hydrogels may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for treating bone metastasis caused by breast cancer.

AB Many skeletal diseases have common pathological phenotype of defective osteogenesis of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), in which histone modifications play an important role. However, few studies have examined the dynamics of distinct histone modifications during osteogenesis. In this study, we examined the dynamics of H3K9/K14 and H4K12 acetylation; H3K4 mono , di  and tri methylation; H3K9 di methylation and H3K27 tri methylation in osteogenic genes, runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), osterix (Osx), alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin, during C3H10T1/2 osteogenesis. H3 and H4 acetylation and H3K4 di methylation were elevated, and H3K9 di methylation and H3K27 tri methylation were reduced in osteogenic genes during C3H10T1/2 osteogenesis. C3H10T1/2 osteogenesis could be modulated by altering the patterns of H3 and H4 acetylation and H3K27 tri methylation. In a glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis mouse model, we observed the attenuation of osteogenic potential of osteoporotic BMSCs in parallel with H3 and H4 hypo acetylation and H3K27 hyper tri methylation in Runx2 and Osx genes. When H3 and H4 acetylation was elevated, and H3K27 tri methylation was reduced, the attenuated osteogenic potential of osteoporotic BMSCs was rescued effectively. These observations provide a deeper insight into the mechanisms of osteogenic differentiation and the pathophysiology of osteoporosis and can be used to design new drugs and develop new therapeutic methods to treat skeletal diseases.

AB Micro RNAs (miRNA) are currently used as cancer biomarkers for hematological cancers and solid tumors. Osteosarcoma is the first primary malignant bone tumor, characterized by a complex genetic and resistance to conventional treatments. For this latter property, the median survival has not been improved since 1990 despite preoperative administration of chemotherapeutic agents. The prediction of tumor response before chemotherapy treatment would constitute a major progress for this pathology. We assessed in this study if miRNA profiling could surpass the current limitations for osteosarcoma diagnosis. We measured the miRNA expression in different osteosarcoma samples: (i) 27 osteosarcoma paraffin embedded tumors from patients, (ii) human osteosarcoma cell lines, and (iii) tumors from a syngeneic rat osteosarcoma model, recapitulating human osteosarcoma. miRNA profiles were determined using microfluidic cards performing high throughput TaqMan (R) based PCR assays, called TaqMan (R) Low Density Arrays. Osteosarcoma of rat and human origins showed a miRNA signature, which could discriminate good from bad responders. In particular, we identified five discriminating miRNAs (miR 92a, miR 99b, miR 132, miR 193a 5p and miR 422a) in patient tumors, which could be easily transferable to diagnosis. These discriminating miRNAs, as well as those identified in rat, targeted the TGF beta, the Wnt and the MAP kinase pathways. These results indicate that our platform constitutes a potent diagnostic tool to predict tumor sensitivity to a drug in attempt to better adapt treatment to tumor biological specificities and also to identify new potential therapeutic strategies.

AB Background: Icariin (ICA), one of the main effective components isolated from the traditional Chinese herb Epimedium brevicornu Maxim., has been reported to possess extensive pharmacological actions, including enhanced sexual function, immune regulation, anti inflammation, and anti osteoporosis.
   Methods: Our study was designed to investigate the effect of ICA on cell proliferation and differentiation and the molecular mechanism of OPG/RANKL mediated by the Estrogen Receptor (ER) in hFOB1.19 human osteoblast cells.
   Results: The experimental results show that ICA can stimulate cell proliferation and increase the activity of Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Osteocalcin (BGP) and I Collagen (Col I) and a number of calcified nodules. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein expression of OPG and RANKL and the OPG/ RANKL mRNA and protein expression ratios were upregulated by ICA. The above mentioned results indicated that the optimal concentration of ICA for stimulating osteogenesis was 50ng/mL. Subsequent mechanistic studies comparing 50ng/mL ICA with an estrogen receptor antagonist demonstrated that the effect of the upregulated expression is connected with the estrogen receptor. In conclusion, ICA can regulate bone formation by promoting cell proliferation and differentiation and upregulating the OPG/RANKL expression ratio by the ER in hFOB1.19 human osteohlast cells.

AB Objective(s): This study aimed to determine the therapeutic effect of equol (EQ) on osteoporotic osteoarthritis (OP OA).Materials and Methods: Thirty six 12 week old female Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham group, OP OA group, and EQ group (n=12). OP OA was induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) combined with ovariectomy (OVX). EQ was orally administrated (10 mu g/g/day) after the operation for 12 weeks. The efficacy was evaluated by gross pathology and histopathologic evaluation. The underlying mechanism was investigated by immunohistochemical analysis, micro computed tomography (micro CT) scanning, and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining.Results: EQ effectively retarded cartilage degeneration, decreased the levels of matrix metalloproteinases 13 (MMP 13), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5 (ADAMTS 5), nuclear factor kappa B P65 (NF cB P65) and caspase 3, and increased the levels of collagen type II (Col II), Col I, aggrecan (AGG), and inhibitor of NF cB alpha (ficB alpha) in the cartilage. In addition, EQ increased bone mineral density, improved the microstructural parameters of the subchondral bone (SB), and decreased the number of osteoclasts.Conclusion: EQ exerted a chondroprotective effect on OP OA in rats, associated with inhibition of the NF cB signaling pathway and chondrocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, EQ showed an osteoprotective effect on SB via inhibiting osteoclastic activities.

AB Modified macroporous structures and active osteogenic substances are necessary to overcome the limited bone regeneration capacity and low degradability of self curing calcium phosphate cement (CPC). Curcumin (CUR), which possesses strong osteogenic activity and poor aqueous solubility/bioavailability, esterifies the side chains in hyaluronic acid (HA) to form a water soluble CUR HA macromolecule. In this study, we incorporated the CUR HA and glucose microparticles (GMPs) into the CPC powder to fabricate the CUR HA/GMP/CPC composite, which not only retained the good injectability and mechanical strength of bone cements, but also significantly increased the cement porosity and sustained release property of CUR HA in vitro. CUR HA incorporation greatly improved the differentiation ability of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to osteoblasts by activating the RUNX family transcription factor 2/fibroblast growth factor 18 (RUNX2/FGF18) signaling pathway, increasing the expression of osteocalcin and enhancing the alkaline phosphatase activity. In addition, in vivo implantation of CUR HA/GMP/CPC into femoral condyle defects dramatically accelerated the degradation rate of cement and boosted local vascularization and osteopontin protein expression, and consequently promoted rapid bone regeneration. Therefore, macroporous CPC based composite cement with CUR HA shows a remarkable ability to repair bone defects and is a promising translational application of modified CPC in clinical practice.

AB We reported accentuated lactational decreases in areal bone mineral density and only partial skeletal recovery after lactation in Ugandan women with HIV (WWH) initiated on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate based antiretroviral therapy (TDF based ART) during pregnancy compared to women without HIV (REF). WWH also had higher breast milk calcium in the first months of lactation. To investigate the mechanisms, we measured bone turnover markers (bone resorption: C terminal telopeptide [CTX]; bone formation: procollagen type 1 N terminal propeptide [P1NP], bone specific and total alkaline phosphatase [BALP, TALP]), hormones (parathyroid hormone [PTH], intact fibroblast growth factor 23 [FGF23], 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)(2)D]), vitamin D status (25 hydroxyvitamin D [25OHD]), and indices of mineral metabolism and renal function. Blood and urine samples collected at 36 weeks of gestation, 14 and 26 weeks of lactation, and 3 6 months after lactation were analyzed. Mean 25OHD was >50 nmol/L throughout. Both groups experienced similar biochemical changes during pregnancy and lactation to women in other settings, but within these patterns, the two groups differed significantly. Notably, WWH had higher PTH (+31%) and lower 1,25(OH)(2)D ( 9%) and TmP/GFR ( 9%) throughout, lower P1NP ( 27%) and plasma phosphate ( 10%) in pregnancy, higher CTX (+15%) and BALP (+19%), and lower eGFR ( 4%) during and after lactation. P1NP/CTX ratio was lower in WWH than REF in pregnancy ( 21%), less so in lactation ( 15%), and similar after lactation. Additionally, WWH had lower plasma calcium ( 5%), lower FGF23 ( 16%) and fasting urinary calcium ( 34%) at one or both lactation timepoints, and higher fasting urinary phosphate (+22%) at 26 weeks of lactation and after lactation. These differences resemble reported TDF effects, especially raised PTH, increased bone resorption, decreased bone formation, and decreased renal function, and may explain the observed differences in bone mineral density and breast milk calcium. Further studies are needed to determine whether HIV and TDF based ART have long term consequences for maternal bone health and offspring growth. (c) 2023 The Authors.

AB Purpose: Alendronate is a widely used anti osteoporotic drug. PFN1 gene is a newly identified early onset Paget's disease pathogenic gene. The purpose of this study is to study whether the genetic variations in this gene affect the clinical efficacy of alendronate in postmenopausal Chinese women with low bone mass. Patients and Methods: Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms in PFN1 gene were genotyped. A total of 500 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or osteopenia were included. All participants were treated with weekly alendronate 70 mg for 12 months. A total of 466 subjects completed the follow up. Bone mineral density (BMD) of lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip were measured at baseline and after treatment. Results: After 12 months of treatment, the BMD of lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip all increased significantly (all P < 0.001), with an average increase of 4.72 +/  5.31%, 2.08 +/  4.45%, and 2.42 +/  3.46%, respectively. At baseline, there were no significant differences in BMD at lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip between different genotype groups (P > 0.05). We failed to identify any significant association between the genotypes or haplotypes of PFN1 and the BMD response to alendronate therapy. Conclusion: Genetic polymorphisms of PFN1 may not be a major contributor to the therapeutic response to alendronate treatment in Chinese women with low bone mass.

AB Background Mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) derived small Extracellular Vesicles (sEVs) are considered as a new cell free therapy for pain caused by nerve injury, but whether human placental mesenchymal stem cell derived sEVs relieve pain in sciatic nerve injury and its possible mechanism are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the roles of hPMSCs derived sEVs and related mechanisms in neuropathic pain. Methods The spared nerve injury (SNI) mouse model was employed. Intrathecal injection of sEVs or miR 26a 5p agomir was performed on the seventh day of modeling, to study its anti nociceptive effect. sEVs' miRNA sequencing (miRNA Seq) and bioinformatics analysis were performed to study the downstream mechanisms of miRNAs. RT qPCR, protein assay and immunofluorescence were used for further validation. Results A single intrathecal injection of sEVs durably reversed mechanical hypersensitivity in the left hind paw of mice with partial sciatic nerve ligation. Immunofluorescence studies found that PKH26 labeled sEVs were visible in neurons and microglia in the dorsal horn of the ipsilateral L4/5 spinal cord and more enriched in the ipsilateral. According to miRNA seq results, we found that intrathecal injection of miR 26a 5p agomir, the second high counts microRNA in hPMSCs derived sEVs, significantly suppressed neuropathic pain and neuroinflammation in SNI mice. Bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase reporter gene analysis identified Wnt5a as a direct downstream target gene of miR 26a 5p. The results showed that overexpression of miR 26a 5p in vivo could significantly reduce the expression level of Wnt5a. In addition, Foxy5, a mimetic peptide of Wnt5a, can significantly reverse the inhibitory effect of miR 26a 5p on neuroinflammation and neuropathic pain, and at the same time, miR 26a 5p can rescue the effect of Foxy5 by overexpression. Conclusions We reported that hPMSCs derived sEVs as a promising therapy for nerve injury induced neuropathic pain. In addition, we showed that the miR 26a 5p in the sEVs regulated Wnt5a/Ryk/CaMKII/NFAT partly take part in the analgesia through anti neuroinflammation, which suggests an alleviating pain effect through non canonical Wnt signaling pathway in neuropathic pain model in vivo.

AB The niche is typically considered as a pre  established structure sustaining stem cells. Therefore, the regulation of its formation remains largely unexplored. Whether distinct molecular mechanisms control the establishment versus maintenance of a stem cell niche is unknown. To address this, we compared perinatal and adult bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), a key component of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche. MSCs exhibited enrichment in genes mediating m 6 A mRNA methylation at the perinatal stage and downregulated the expression of Mettl3, the m 6 A methyltransferase, shortly after birth. Deletion of Mettl3 from developing MSCs but not osteoblasts led to excessive osteogenic differentiation and a severe HSC niche formation defect, which was significantly rescued by deletion of Klf2 , an m 6 A target. In contrast, deletion of Mettl3 from MSCs postnatally did not affect HSC niche. Stem cell niche generation and maintenance thus depend on divergent molecular mechanisms, which may be exploited for regenerative medicine.

AB Alendronate, an inhibitor of bone resorption, is widely used in osteoporosis treatment. However, concerns have been raised about potential oversuppression of bone turnover during long term use. We report on nine patients who sustained spontaneous nonspinal fractures while on alendronate therapy, six of whom displayed either delayed or absent fracture healing for 3 months to 2 yr during therapy.
   Histomorphometric analysis of the cancellous bone showed markedly suppressed bone formation, with reduced or absent osteoblastic surface in most patients. Osteoclastic surface was low or low normal in eight patients, and eroded surface was decreased in four. Matrix synthesis was markedly diminished, with absence of double tetracycline label and absent or reduced single tetracycline label in all patients. The same trend was seen in the intracortical and endocortical surfaces.
   Our findings raise the possibility that severe suppression of bone turnover may develop during long term alendronate therapy, resulting in increased susceptibility to, and delayed healing of, nonspinal fractures. Although coadministration of estrogen or glucocorticoids appears to be a predisposing factor, this apparent complication can also occur with monotherapy. Our observations emphasize the need for increased awareness and monitoring for the potential development of excessive suppression of bone turnover during long term alendronate therapy.
